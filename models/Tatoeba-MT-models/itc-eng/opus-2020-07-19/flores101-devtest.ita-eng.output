This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely widespread, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown in the upper part, with pale or carotenoid coloring in the lower part.
The discovery also allows for detailed information on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachide, but has other typical characteristics of feathers, beards and beards, researchers have concluded that the rachide is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.

This morning the public prosecutor, Kier Starer QC, issued a statement stating that both Huhne and Pryce will be accused.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for Business that Davey has left vacant.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Court of Magistrates is scheduled for 16 February.
Victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to the arm and the jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider must undergo a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was put to the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from an eye, lacks a section of skull and his face has been rebuilt in titanium.
Schneider witnessed through videoconference from a USF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two single championship races.
The first in slalom, where at the first descent had a DNT recorded. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race he participated in, the giant slalom, saw him ranked as a tenth in the female group of the category "seats", with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first ranked, Austrian Claudia Loesh, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four women's skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants at Slalom Giant did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cellphone that had been stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her cell phone and her laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhatha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with the face covered.
None of the three people who were at home at the time of the crash of the car were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services released the driver from the Red Audi TT.
She was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Cambridge Hospital.
From that moment on, Adekoya is at the court of the sheriff of Edinburgh with the charge of having killed his own son.
It is held waiting to refer to trial and judgment, but any testimony given by an eye witness could be polluted, since its image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have considered the publication of potentially injurious photos.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University, "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on a land of interest".
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility of judicial proceedings, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made until the formal indictment.
According to what is said, the subject of the document will be the dispute over the borders, that Palestine wants to be based on the boundaries existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth interim election council of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country into new elections, including resignations from the previous CEP.
The committee was responsible for Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which started in October, which are in dispute with the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused small burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was informed by Apple of 34 other overheating-related incidents, which the company called "non-gray".
In his reply, the ministry called "absolutely appreciable" the postponement of the report by Apple.
The earthquake at Marianne was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Office for Emergency Management of the Northern Mariane Islands no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of tsunami being carried out.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took hostage Hong Kong tourists after he hijacked their bus.
With his M16 Rolando Mendoza rifle, he set a fire on tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released immediately together with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit dead.
Liggins traced the father's footsteps and took on his medical career.
After following the training in obstetrics, in 1959 he went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that administration of a hormone would accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black scales' with flight records.
Her wrestling colleagues also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Mona was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"Mona was weird like me... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... we hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to the transition from Australia to the Republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the Acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the respondents, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents argued that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to win in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three crews at the Commonwealth Games, but accused several disturbances that led to doubting its physical shape.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known until today.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter on earth, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, having been struggling with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, has been in charge since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed his signature on a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing more than "politic nonsense and nonsense."
An application for the presidency is made in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transport is not being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking for cars or interchange parking is not available on site.
The fears associated with the absence of the means of transport have revealed the possibility of making the match compulsory at closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in the magazine Science, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was considered that the time needed for this process was much greater; this was due to the coupling between an endemic fin of Darwin, strong geospiza, and the fringel of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be trimmed and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into laminates.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand painted images in the books called "mine codes" just because it is possible to be so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how much acid is or basic (alkaline) the chemical element.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H letter of pH).
Hydrogen ions mean protons that have been ripped away from the electrons (as hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers there will be a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and will form a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with current water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the houses of the mining cities of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remains of sewer nets.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public baths, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone away thousands of miles, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost immediately.
The launch of the satellite in space was made with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visual.
To carry in space a satellite or a telescope, it is necessary a high rocket more than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to provide us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium sized feline that nourishes of medium sized prey, which vary from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every cat has and which allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social feline and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 separated from each other, and by a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely taught with each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The white of lions acts in a very similar way to the white of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other great feline), even with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a tensile force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the Panthera genus) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four feline are the only ones to roar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but it looks more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Birds love to feed small animals. If possible, they go hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the storks follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, watering on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the celelotes blend with the surrounding environment and then plunge them over.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example, if you move beyond a mountain or river, or you move on a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment from the one in which you were before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passing of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is increasingly less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different among themselves that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide ejected from them (through the breath).
The plants elaborate their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shades.
We build our houses from the plants and produce our clothes with the plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without the plants the animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his age and therefore feared nothing, except the other mosasaurs.
From its long faucets came more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus a further row located on the palate, so for whoever crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for certain, but it is possible that it had the biforcute language. Its feeding included turtles, large fish, other mossauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar, Roman banquets also provided for various strange or unusual gates, such as the boars, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called Giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women were eating while sitting on the chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course, meals of ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for every deity, which was considered the abode of the god.
People were offering sacrifices to gods and priests were trying to provide for the needs of deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built that became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to God.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was carried out outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the northern sages it is said that Erik the Red gave her the name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimos tribes were already living there.
Despite being all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the film "The mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is drawn a map of the treasure.
However, this is false. Although on the back of the document there is something written, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears reversed at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the wide parchment document (measure 29.75 inches per 24.5 inch) was rolled up to be re-filled.
Probably, then, the annotation was only affixed as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded South France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
With civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization derives from Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn linked to "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the size of society.
Cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means conveying knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being so recognized as true and own civilization.
During the war of independence, the thirteen were formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, it was entrusted to the State authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of their acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was needed, and these, on their part, had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, football, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of Japan almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing there gradually recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East Indies Company in 1624 established a base in the south-west part of Taiwan, starting a transformation that involved the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and taking Chinese bracelets to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under control of the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first war in Asia (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, thereby giving in to Taiwan's sovereignty in Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site was recovered, but restoration work is still under way.
The most common format in the world for still picture photography, for example, is the 35 mm, the same as the film most used on the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the size 35 mm is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing for twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derisive third party rule is a simple guide that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where the main subject is placed is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful, was forced to be examined.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European States for over a thousand years, in spite of language and costume differences.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civil supply, despite the violation of international law usually accepted and codified by many international treaties over the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters to prevent access by any ship to entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had provoked a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and effluents of the first world war, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period in China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most well known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, fierce wars were fought by many nobles in the battle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were opened to all men candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since army classifications, instead of being class-based, are now based on calibre.
The French Revolution has also been a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their revolution.
Maometto was deeply interested in the issues that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived over time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave lies on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you knew about it. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has come to our day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the King Valley of Egypt, hosts many pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), several smaller graves, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "uparched" is similar to a V and the indication "rounded down" to a graph or to a square with no lower side.
Towards the top means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the alamero (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc results in a stronger and more determined sound.
You can decide to add your custom pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archery you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the marketplace forced King Luigi XVI, in a tremor of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with the queen Mary Antonietta, to their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Luigi Carlo, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to hold the windows of their carriage.
At some point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism supported to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest in bonds were oscillating on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains resulting from the protracted exploitation of the Philippine people during the time constituted profits at the basis of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when events took place is commonly called the Upper Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII century (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Middle Ages Bass, which ends by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or from the technological imperative to the narrow sense that man's destiny is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are developed to reduce the costs related to the ownership of a car.
Car massing also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a strong component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time have been used, customs and culture linked to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have more effective results than the laws imposed in an arbitrary manner.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His fame as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century his prestige was reduced, especially because the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of the capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and in the XIV century.
Initially, clothing is subject to the strong influence of the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of the lines of communication makes it possible to spread styles in the West to be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of the buttons to tie the clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised solely for the purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Supporting agriculture is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from crops.
Historically much of the farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, which do not feel representative of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who because of neglect, as a result of misfortune, or because of intentional abuse, have grown without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or wild. Some of them have been secreted by people (often their parents themselves): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children could have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, it shows behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference toward man.
Project-based learning should make learning even simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Excafolding is not a way of learning, the more help for those who undertake a new learning experience, as can be the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "suffolding", but it is also the small assistant in the form of Microsoft Office graffiti.
Virtual cauffolds are integrated into the software and have the purpose of questioning, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on his own.
Children are given credit for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee food, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe houses, loving trust parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to meet all the needs not met in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet carry additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relations".
The use of video recording has made it possible to find significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements of the duration of a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The Speech of the President," Oliver Sacks described as people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage, however, are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even maintains that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century the research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, that is hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is removed from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backward between the two pools.
For a premium with a digestive apparatus similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy their needs of amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, also death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not surprise us that our ancestors themselves have resolved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively quiet awakening to bring you to a state of consciousness, without awakening completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it from the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorhythm provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force them to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Minor is tension, more positive is the existing vital force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and settlement.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is hampered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayan rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in an omnipresent love path.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (light energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
The Deity Yoga is the highlight of Tibetan meditation. Through the portrayal of various deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in the second world war, leading to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the conflicts of system, procedural and cultural, led to the break-up between the two countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the allies of the time had become enemies; so began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years, and it would be fought in fact, by mercenaries, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already been demolished; the only option was to beat in retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans were now obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods through the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country the preservation of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time contrasting the ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and goods through the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German military navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have the chance to conquer Britain, as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of ancient times to have freely available milk, wool, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like the shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherdhood are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England, the wagons were built.
Although they were simply formed from parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more accidental roads of the period, allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively early to keep track position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had on top of an iron bar.
It became a common practice, even if the iron caused greater wear of the wagon's wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place to those in iron. In 1767 they made their appearance the first rails completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Human beings started walking in the erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "a man erect").
His predecessor, the australopitico, did not usually walk straight.
Specialization signs for bipede hiking are present in the fossils of Australopitec dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, while problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the John Hancock Congress and by the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printery of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap manifests".
The document was read publicly for the first time on 8 July in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the commission was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had her read to her room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 edges of Dunlap still known are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. These are those we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that combine them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
Finally, the manipulation of coded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all the computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary or bit digits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a drug container or an open chemical container.
Check whether there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with the cicmics of beds, insects that have strongly adapted themselves to become man's parasites.
Both the killer cynics and the cicmics of the beds are nestless, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (SM) records some 400,000 known cases, placing first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
SM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is part of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple can decide that growing a child is not in their own interests, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their son.
In an adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But this is not only about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge were accepted, including psychology.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend in a decisive way on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the bacterial protein of the bacteriophagus with radioactive sulphur.
The mutations may have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and depending on whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at germ cell level; the mutations that take place elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism calls on people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and wild fauna.
Examples of activities to be carried out on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the Oranges of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic and even, they all are somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time support them.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, almost all of which complain.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruins.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they thrown out every day? Are engineers who design them that they are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" (i.e. "trafficking flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and of the interactions they generate with the other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the conduct of drivers cannot be expected with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so in turn traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generally mathematically.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to lift the flight. The ability to fly has allowed them to escape more easily to the enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are benefited by the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small afracts to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold the wings are the dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone was right, but many others believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), would move around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and the second longest river on Earth. It carries a water quantity equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some points reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water from the rivers of the planet is poured into the oceans comes from Rio delle Amazzoni.
The main river Rio delle Amazzoni is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). In it you pour the waters of thousands of minor effluents.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never overcome in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were still enchanting by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is made up of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the least population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These are more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Note that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metal. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys made up of minimal quantities of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so many trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil has therefore become a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a temper.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a core with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission pump.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, dividing the nucleus further, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up in the presence of a low push or nothing.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the surface lava climbing.
The theories of content are focused on looking for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people associate with and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most widespread content are the theory of the hierarchy of the needs of Maslow and the Theory to two factors of Herzberg.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to stay "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put into practice disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
To the extreme opposite, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels the need to change the entire operation of the team and do it itself.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to differences between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, because meetings can take place according to the various time zones, which may not be included in local management.
The existence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one which sets the standards for each member.
For what reason should an organization have the desire to address the long process leading to the construction of an learning organisation? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organisational learning can be innovation.
When you are able to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and engineering may emerge.
Consequently, the collaboration path within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the basis of scientific research.
Some types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors have long been known to affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes never previously observed.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite a strong scientific connotation, the IA is a branch of the very important IT that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research on IA includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, vocals and facials.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in the economic, medical, engineering and military field, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The tours represent a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext to share experiences and experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students at the Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, often their first experiences with blogs are distinguished by a grammatical and uncaring spelling, but generally the presence of a public changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative opinions the author of the blog commits to improving writing.
Blogs also "constrict students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop the learning of students well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and the present of the country.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and uncontaminated beauty of the Muskoka region and so much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The vast areas to the north are rarely populated, some of them are almost unsavory wild lakes.
If one compares the population, the result can be quite surprising: in the United States, the number of African-Americans is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a living continent.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious resort resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations in France.
In the lands Arabs also took Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the road to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west border with the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one of the look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Be firm to refuse men, and do not be afraid of opposing them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the X century B.C.; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenians.
The Portuguese destroyed her to rebuild her with the name of White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, nangilla and so much chimpanillary, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma, burying much of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the African mountain gorillas.
You can use a wedding-bond (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short run.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctú" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the sands of the desert.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Worlds of the African World" it was one of the main stages.
With its more arabic touch than Africa, the city is clearly distinguished from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which sustains a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for the conservation and entry of the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The Island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the whole territory, represents for many tourists the main goal.
The series of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a slender bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on land that has been subsidized from the northern coast, which is densely populated.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point to go from.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastline of mangroves worldwide. It extends to 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared World Heritage by UNESCO. The forest part included in the Indian territory takes the name of Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the plain of the Gange.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is made up of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild fauna; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 real tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 masculine deer.
Buses start from the inter district bus station (on the other side of the river) along the whole of the day, although many (especially those headed east and Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses often between different districts are full, it will be good to buy the ticket with a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust Japanese small buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punacha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a broken bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tralices have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two wide lanes 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in the present Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-maliomad hunters and also practicing support agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of Indies", was born in the 16th century from the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best players in the world.
In December, in Las Cañitas polo fields, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and games at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Argentina de Polo Association.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falklands sterling (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of British sterling (GBP).
The only bank of the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers the currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley often can also be paid with US credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on peripheral islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check ahead with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency out of the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below that marked by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "pious" seasons defined: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how gentle they may seem: bisunti, alci, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not maintained an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Keep in mind also that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the sad known naval stable of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 U.S. and German lives have been lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the trees of pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waititamata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. You can make the bathroom safely.
The most popular local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You may have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better face the journey.
The water of the local faucet is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the coffee 'flat white' is born from a foreign idea. The espresso is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral barrier and accidents for one of these causes on the coral barrier are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, stick to the indications and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can only find occasionally.
The sharks are present, but rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often conclude conventions with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campings, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer breakfast packages, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combined packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to find additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted before the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
During some musical festivals, most participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this as a crucial element of experience.
To be close to the centre of the action you need to get early and get a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there could be sections of the festival where the music will continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, since the ice crossing causes quite annoying noise for those who are most exposed.

Anyone who decides to drive to high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On ice and snowy carriages, friction is reduced and you cannot drive like when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in very little time it can fall so many snows to keep you stuck.
The precipitation and snow-flakes, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, may also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, so it is enough normal equipment to get a good visual.

There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these results to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, for this reason it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged within sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not spread in their regions of origin.
The parasites may damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmission of poison or infections.

If you don't have the habit of driving on country streets, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as they predominate steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighbouring Austria more south.
Sweets to fruit are a classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.

The staffes are supports for the knight's feet and they are hung on the two sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present security problems for the possibility that the rider's feet will be blocked.
If a ghost is struck by a horse but has a foot stuck in the staff, he could be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most horsemen wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Afterwards some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather cloth pull out of the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granitic cliffs are blocked.

Sports on free descent snow, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide snow-skiing thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (the ski banners), which devote whole vacation periods to ski activity in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rupestrian paintings with the representation of humans that skiano date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.

Think of the ski track as a route similar to the hiking track.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way more than those walking paths, but only very rarely will you reach the ski speeds of the bottom without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel across multiple countries it would need to apply for visas and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area works rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to pass the passport controls again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States and thus save time, money and bureaucracy.

The breeding of reindeer is an important source of support for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade rests is also at the base of many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi were always involved in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of Sámi.

Risacca currents consist of the return flow of waves that break into the beach, often near a coral barrier or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can be formed towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths survive because of fatigue in the attempt to swim countercurrent, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, coming back to swimming will no longer be difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you are not in danger of being trapped again, or assess whether you are waiting for help, based on your skills and if you have been notified.

The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands there are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of an still active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the hills of the peninsula merge in the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinella Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
