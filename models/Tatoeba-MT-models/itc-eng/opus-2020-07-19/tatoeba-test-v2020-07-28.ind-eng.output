I will be happy to help him.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing a lens?
Tom won't like the answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to get in touch with us.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too blunt until it can't be used to cut meat, I'm finally using my pocket knife.
He's blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom was missing.
Where have you been?
The traffic lights are used to adjust the traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room got a little sunlight.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have breached that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm used to not getting sidetracked.
It smells really bad.
The term is a phrase.
There is no god but Allah, and He is the Messenger of Allah.
Just yesterday I found out.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's ride Intercity-Express.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes, this signature will keep me alive."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I'm just telling Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never be able to find your way home, through a narrow rocky road.
Tom really wasn't home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
Give me a birthday card that's coming soon.
Please read it again.
When can you?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost hit.
I'm leaving, too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logos, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
Two things are unrelated.
How can I not be aware of this?
What's this called?
I'm still home because it's raining down.
That's the right answer.
Generally, men run faster than women.
To me, there was no fundamental difference between the cultures of these two countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight.
Tell me why he's not here.
It may have affected their decisions.
The rain lasted all night long.
Tom's starting to get jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that awful?
I'll buy you this bag.
It's too sweet.
I encouraged Mary into the water.
Have you ever gone to London?
It was our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused an invitation to a concert.
When are you going home?
She was sitting around her grandsons.
The boy just fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He focused on those puzzles.
The man died a few hours ago.
You wanna go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We found out that the front door was locked.
May I speak with Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is an acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I've assumed that he's lying, but it doesn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The election time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
All of us are equal before the law, but the rich sometimes have more advantage.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
The meeting was over at nine o'clock.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We're facing a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother is not ten years old.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, it's just you can't drive.
May I see your coupon?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married a woman who was easier than he was.
He was a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but in the end he failed.
Do you have any light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be reborn as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom was here, but Bill wasn't here yet.
Laurie speaking.
They're recommending him to go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students went to university education.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom kept his voice down so that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long-haired?
He greets her every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, it's better on the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
Her mother's worried about her son.
What opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I'm tired.
Tom was killed Mary.
The data is often incorrect.
Get up!
We've ordered that six-and-a-half.
We named the dog Tim.
He opened it quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom ordered Mary to follow him.
It's been eleven hours.
I'm smarter than them.
It's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
