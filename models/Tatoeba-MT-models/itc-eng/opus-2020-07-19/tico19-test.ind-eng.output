The cumulative coronavirus (COVID-19) disease that is increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and England, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incident in the case of coronavirus (COVID-19) showed similar trains in the United States of Europe/European Economic Area and England that confirmed that, despite different stages depending on country, the COVID-19 pandemics developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit, it should increase the number of patients that will need medical care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a classer case of pneumonia with unknown etiology reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiokok.
On January 9, 2020, the Tiokok Disease Control and Prevention Center reported that the kausatif agent of this disease was a new coronavirus now called akat 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far shows that about 80% of patients with COPID-19 suffer from mild illness, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of them recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of other cases experienced a critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated at the hospital due to COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19-United States cumulative train in Europe/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it to the incident in the Hubei Province of Tiokok.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and the UK to the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tyokok, COVID-19 experienced geographical distribution further and dynamic COVID-19 pandemics on the other side of the world at this time followed the pandemic dynamics in Tiokok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the case confirmed by the WHO case.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed cases were first reported by France on January 24, 2020 to those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Turkey.
On 15 March 2020, the case of COVID-19 has been detected in all 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020, with the date included 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents case COVID-19
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by every country around the world is updated every day at 8.00. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Department, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with the train in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 case, we counted the cumulative incident of 14 days, so calculate the natural voyage of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period January 31–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
The 14-day cumulative train in the EU/EEA and the UK is usually following the Hubei Province (Tiokok) train (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to rise about February 21, and then increased to about February 28, 2020 (additional child).
This train is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and UK show a similar increase in cumulative COVID-19 incidents.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data suggested that, until 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases equal to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
A tracked train at the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemic is increasing at a rate that is equal in all countries.
This is apart from the differences in the level of the countries, the various health responses to society, and the possible differences in the definition of the case between countries and the protocols to choose patients to be tested for the confirmation of the CVID-19, which includes the assessment of the case.
Early in March 2020, physicians in the affected Italian region explained the situation about 10% patients needed intensive care and media resources to report that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data received in the case of COVID-19 in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at the EU/EAA level is only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
Studies carried out in the year 2010-2011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and treatment of Madya in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and nursing for the 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modelling scenario related to the severity of health care capacity, with the prevalence estimates of the case of COVID-19 inappreciation for each EU/EEA and the UK that relate to risk >90% exceeding the capacity of intensive care bed, provided at a six-fold ECDC rapid risk assessment of CVID-19.
Because so far the most classified case in a particular region in the EU/EEA and the UK, and the hospital and intensive care units usually serve specific regional service coverage populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of Unit Area Development for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current train in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of patients COVID-19 requiring health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the delayed approach to mitigation, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospital to understand, accept, and adopt the correct response if it is not applied earlier.
The rapid risk assessment also indicates steps in the health of the public to increase the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window of opportunity when the country has the possibility to increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA health care system is likely to suffer from a surge in patients who require intensive care within days or weeks to come.
The disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has caused disaster for humans.
Similar to the homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause symptoms similar to similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower level of depravity and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and older than young people, and more on men than women.
In response to an increasing number of publications about this emerging disease, this article tries to give timely and comprehensive consideration to the rapidly growing subject of research.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many unanswered questions remain, we hope that this review will help to clarify and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Semi Festival on January 25, 2020 has been a memory that has never happened and is not forgotten for all the Tionghoa people who were told to stay at home during the holidays and weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
The virus is a very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "an enemy of number 1" and potentially damage more than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 establishing a virus that is isolated from some patients, more than 200 has been published about COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study aimed at measuring research into the new and fast - growing subject.
As we may be, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, i.e. Middle Eastern Breeding Syndrome (MERS, plague in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease as well as some other unanswered questions but urgent ones.
According to tradition, COV is considered a non-lethal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% gain 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with morbidity and terrible mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV plague in human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the original classification of pneumonia was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, a CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, an infection of health care providers is reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23rd, forty districts were held in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly competed with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered to be an early location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague as a global health emergency.
When the report was written, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
Because of the rapid development of the situation, the final coverage and severity of the plague still have to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following latest images of epidemics (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, only a few under 20 years old, and only 14 infected people under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more male infection (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is extended in a classer, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from weaning to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from alert to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproductive numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increases exponentially before 23 January 2020, according to mass transport time before the Semi Festival in Tiokok.
Patient mortality with a confirmed case of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the most appropriate mortality for all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.51%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of sex (man), age (≥ 60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large-scale virus subfamily that contains single-celled RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) connects to its receptor cells, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) altering enzymes and peptide 4 (DPP4) peptides, each for SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The genom RNA virus is released into the siteplasma; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoprotein sampule and nucleopapsid proteins form vesicles containing virion, which then undergo fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with a genetic similarity of over 99.98% of the 10 samples administered; the sample was taken from the place of the outbreak, namely the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscope transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in epithelium of very thin human respiratory tract.
ACE2 humans were found as a receiver for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein is related to human ACE2 weaker than its bond with S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 caused non-segregated SARS-CoV infection in patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new orf3b, orf3b, short protein stored with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus pathogens and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a full human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2,9 and in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is composed of dimer and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the recognition and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in the drug coating to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original ring and middle
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each is transmitted to humans through musks and camels.
Using the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic comparison with other CoV, bats are considered the original SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, an intermediation that helps virus cross species barriers to human infection is still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. suggested snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans that involved homologous recombination in S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiokok, suggest that gilling, long-term ant eater mammals that are commonly used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, potentially as an intermediate ring SARS-CoV-2 based 99% genetic homology on the CoV found in coV and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences that are spread across the genome are still a huge difference; therefore, a comprehensive result as a concrete evidence is still unattained (Gbr. 3).
Physical chemistry SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfection containing chlorine, asbestos, chloroform, and other fat routers, but not chlorhexidin, effectively disabling viruses.
Generally, the entire human population does not have immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and because it is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed study reported any immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another study of CoV before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
Generally speaking, after invasion of the anang, the virus is identified by the immune system using the PRR receptor, which includes the C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses suppress inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon-type (IFN) synthesis that restricts the spread of viruses and accelerates antigen phagosis by macrophage.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help virus avoid immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T-Limphosite, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
The T-cell helps produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, the CoV can slow down the function of T-cells by subjugating apoptosis of T-cells.
Humorous immunity, which includes complexes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, an antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large amount of free radical locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure to the mosquito organs and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, marked with the aid class, is more about the age of a rapist and pregnant woman.
Generally speaking, people who have a large number of viruses or who are disturbed by their immune function have a higher chance of infection than others.
Estimate of the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as explained above, show that the 4,8 incubation period (3.0-72) day based on demography 8,866 cases.
It is of utmost importance that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period so that people who are infected are prevented, but without symptoms, from transmitting viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to viruses or infections are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptoms of COVID-19, with or without any other symptoms such as dry cough, breath ache, muscle pain, lymph, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness.
In severe cases, the development of patients’ disease is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic syndrome, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute breathing and fever, even if they are not immune to lung imaging, have to be infected with the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 shows that 98% of symptoms for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for spleen, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies in family class and classers that have been transmitted from asymtomatics.
In contrast, the 2012 demographic study showed that the patients of MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnoea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% patients need ventilation support, much more than patients with COPID-19 and are consistent with the mortality of MRS higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) are also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support needed for about 14%-20% patients.
Until February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 is 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In contrast to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality of 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV was only about 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 given in Table 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not kill MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Awitan class is often found in one family or in one group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel history or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or have dealings with people infected or patients in the last two weeks before sunset.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients sent from the hospital can carry viruses again. This leads to caution to increase quarantine time.
At the early stage, patients have normal white blood cell counts or decreases.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and increased viraemia were found in 1,099 patients COVID-19.
Heart and muscle enzymes and hemoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, and C-reactive protein and blood levels increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, i.e. the fibrous excretion product in the blood, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
Other chest photos were found in the large number of patients COVID-19 and marked with bilaterally prominent shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occur, inflammation of control, accumulating fluid, and progressive fibrosis greatly worsens the disturbance of gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumositis dysfunction lowers the surface level and increases surface pressure so as to lower the lung's ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst finding in chest photos is often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathology analysis showed pneumositis decommation, hyalin membrane development, and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and sinsitial cells that were many of the lungs that died from this disease, consistent with the pathology of virus and ARDS infection and similar to the pathology analyses of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to a false negative level, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only depended on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the basic SHERLOCK technique protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fraction in 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cell stick within less than one hour without requiring a complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new COVs, the doctor primarily offers support for patients of COVID-19, while trying to try various therapies that have been used or previously proposed for other COV treatment, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral, immunosuppressant, steroid, plasma from cured patients, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a cured patient is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmacy companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the early stage, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacks the lungs and may also attack another organ that expresses ACE2 in a lower level, such as a gastrointestinal system and kidney.
But dysfunction and failure to breathe are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is very important to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with heavy breathing symptoms should be supported by the oxygenation of the extrakoporeum membrane (ECMO), which is a thermodifying kardiopulmoner-tics technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening breathing.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and protection of vital organ function is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Reactions of an excessive immune system are known to result in cytokine storms on SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokin storm is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the exaggeration of segregated sites of sitokin, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These sitokin-sitokin subjugates immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and failure of the mosquito organ.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of a cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Korticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monochlonal antibody, has been used to handle cytokine storms.
Another immunosuppression for cytokine storms includes modulation of the immune response given to T-cells; IL-1, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhib; blinatumomab; cytokine signal extraction 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, is widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are useless for severe lung injury to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which strongly affect prognosis.
However, the short corticosteroid supply at low doses is being encouraged to be carefully given to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of writing this review, no effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found in a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Remdesivir was a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, recuring diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In recent years, remdesivir also shows an inhibition of other single-cell RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
According to this, Gilead provided this compound for Tiokkok to perform a series of tests on the infected SARS-CoV-2, and the outcome is highly awaited.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as a potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other drugs that patients use should be accurately monitored.
Plasma of cured patients with antibodies
There is a long history of a patient's recovery from contagious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent the health of those who suffer from the disease.
True, a cured patient often has a relatively high level of antibodies in his blood.
Antibodi is immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecules on the pathogen, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had been cured from the COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who were seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and weight of the virus and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification needs to be done to submit these methods for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excessive immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma is widely needed to treat a chronically ill patient.
Specific development and production of antibodies is fast enough to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and to identify the genetic code that fuels effective antibodies or to filter effective antibodies against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production scale of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula is different depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify these components or the optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapy for COPID-19 does not exist, TCM became one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until now or for people who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsules have been found for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of treatment in patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of TCM provinces in TCM in 87% of the patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest level of recovery (13%).
However, these comparisons are still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends produced a study that compared western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time it takes to recover the body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the incapacitated rate is much more short on the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
More impressive, the drop in symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, efficacy and safety TCM are still waiting for a better controlled trial on a larger scale and at more research center.
Another interesting thing is to specify the working mechanism and clarify the effective components in the CTM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very scared of a very contagious and even deadly disease, and those who are quarantined also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Moreover, such symptoms as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroid can lead to greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disorders, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 disease, can cause anxiety and feelings of guilt related to the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental - health care should be provided for patients of the COVID-19, those expected, and those struggling with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support must include the establishment of a multi-disipliner mental health team, a clear communication with a routine update and accurate about the SARS-CoV-2 plague, and a therapy plan and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid any other contact.
Effective vaccines are very important to insert transmission chains from animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable ants and are often equipped with antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus outbreaks.
The effort has been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which is long-term and effective in making an antibodies penetration and/or immunity that protects SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-dissolved vaccines have been evaluated on test animals.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in age and model lethal challenges and its protection against zoonotic virus infections still has to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is probably because SARS delayed 17 years ago and no new cases reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic and classer MERS cases continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to another region because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using a virus that is disabled, plasmid DNA, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and protein-recombination subunits, and some have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Vaccine development against safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to cope with due to a long time to develop vaccines (almost 18 months) and dynamic VOCs.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can become cured without a single stroke.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with morbidity and high mortality on patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of a disease prognosis model is essential for the health care body to prioritize its service, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also happened for COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% patients over 50 years of age in studies with 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have curative comorbidities and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (66-year-olds versus 51-year-olds), which impose age as a predictive factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Type of female: SARS-CoV-2 more infect men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Korbiditas and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events also shed the main cause of death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be linked to a collaguosis with a positive ACE2-, which can result in heart dysfunction in a COVID-19 patient.
Note that underlying age and disease are highly interrelated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP and the severity and prognosis of the COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional marker for heart and heart dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Foto thoracics and temporal clinical development should be considered together with other things to predict the end result and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid usage: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressives that are widely used as an infection therapy for infection to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors of this disease end up suffering an avascular osteonecrosis with a lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and short-lived dose for patients with COPID-19.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer tremendous stress because they have to go through long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and watch the death of close family members and their fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other COVs that cause seizures.
Therefore, in the early or incubation phase, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during daily activity, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-COV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 plague is far worse and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
Currently, a major effort is being made in Tiokok, which includes forty Wuhan regions and cities around and quarantine continues almost the entire population with the hope of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Even though this has been a major economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has declined, indicating the spread of epidemics.
The most optimistic estimate indicates the plague will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
Some, though, were less than optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The research group of Canada reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka and the throat of the cured patient and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the newly identified virus can be repeated episodes, similar to influenza.
Even so, the signs promising to happen in China, if seen on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, indicate that the current strategy might be successful.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half death as well.
However, with quarantine and tight isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
It may also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that is not too pathogenic to be associated with humans.
Compared the COVID-19 epidemics with the SARS and MERS epidemics below.
SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also through direct contact with substances contaminated with viruses.
This virus was also found in the fesses, thus triggering the possibility of a new transmission, which is a fast-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to have contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both the scalp and the N95 respiratory masks (the 1860 series of years) help control the spread of the virus.
The scalpel keeps the sparks of those who are potentially infected against air or attach them to the material surface, which can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (the 1860-year-old series) masks can protect against inhalation of virion with a minimum of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully power; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that are piled together, the provider of health care that is directly related to patients should wear N95 (the 1860 series number) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear appropriate isolation cloaks to further reduce virus contact.
Virus can also infect someone with eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore N95 masks; a virus might enter his body through an eye patch.
Therefore, health - care providers should also wear eyeglasses or glasses while working with patients.
For public society in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for independent quarantine, and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet away is believed to be suitable for keeping a patient's distance.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to the Chinese that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS plague.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wahan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus had a low level of preaching and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and control of the disease was not a problem.
This message is very reassuring to the public, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Semi Festival, so that this critical time is passed to stem a disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Tiokok should draw lessons from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-normal information than clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials in authority; (3) more limited to building potential epidemics at the beginning stage, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more often to exercise target and effective training in order to increase public awareness of the disease epidemics and test and increase the system of public response on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to crack at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak is re-emphasized as the SARS plague is repeated.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important for developing an epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about older than young people and more about men than women, and the degree of death is also higher in age than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit viruses even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to spread COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
As RNA routine to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some patients COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can still have a positive effect on the viral examination.
This find greatly increases the risk of viral spreading.
With such rapid progress in the research of COVID-19, some important problems still need to be solved, that is:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology is 96% found between SARS-CoV-2 and two similar-SARS bat CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal is a midwife species to administer the virus from the original ring, tell bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to numbers 1 and 2, we can't send transmissions effectively and the plague can shoot back any time.
Although molecular modelling and high biochemistry show that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the airway cell and lead to subsequent pathology changes?
Is this virus also related to cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Is this pandemic going to be a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to end the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The zoonotic source of the human Crown virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the Crown virus (CoV) and its ring, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause mild illness, such as selema.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Central Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how much HCoV infection can be very destructive and life threatening.
His skull SARS-CoV-2 in the center of China at the end of 2019 has made COV a resounding and surprising us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis. Therefore, the understanding of the origin of HCoV zoonotics will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats, in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Some HCoV midway reservoirs have also been known.
The identification of animals has a direct involvement in preventing human disease.
The investigation of coV-inang interactions on animals can also give important insights into the pathogenesis of coV in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, with a focus on his findings and his zoonotic origin and his interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and subtracted the HCOV from the perspective of evolution and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, successful ring swing conditions and the involvement of virus evolution in disease disorders are also popularized.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses hiding, inducting positive, and single.
This virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobes between RNA viruses called "CoV", because its morphology resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CoV has an unsegregated genome that has a similar definition.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open rows (ORF1a and ORF1b) which overlap each other. Both are translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicas.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of open read range (ORF) for structural protein, which includes towels or spikes (S), pen or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific complete proteins for specific offspring are also taught by various COV lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequence, CoV is classified as four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genes, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is divided into four gene lines (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are a source of the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV gene, while the cranes are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens for humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, a severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), a central Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as piling and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing the infection of heavy low blood pressure on relatively more patients and having a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organ.
Strain HCoV-229E first, B814, is isolated from the ingus of a patient of the last in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both causing symptoms of recovery.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is generally not dangerous, until SARS plague occurs.
The SARS outbreak that took place in 2003 was one of the most destructive plague in modern history, which infects over 8,000 people with a gross death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the disease of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadically spreading to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), next called SARS-CoV-2, is a police officer in charge of the 2019 COVID-19 virus epidemic, which has taken lives more than 3,120 people and infects more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
Alarm is ringing and the world must prepare itself for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Those seven HCOVs all have a zoonotic origin from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCOVs from bats. In bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created tremendous challenges for the medical, scientific, social, and morals of the world.
The tracking of HCOV's zoonotic origin gives the work frame to understand the natural history, the driving force, and the containment factor is inter-species displacement.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for an animal reservoir, an intermediator, and SARS-CoV-2 amplification, which has important implications in future prevention of circulation.
In this review, we give a general image of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenosis.
We specifically recommend and discuss the general topic that HCoV parent viruses are usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but become pathogenic after the transmission of antspecies to a new ring.
We also review the HCoV evolution train that the increase in transmission capacity is often accompanied by the reduction of pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E strain B814 isolates of the ingus affected patients, various CoVs have been isolated from infected animals, which include turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last roots, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A short summary of the history of HCoV discovery in the chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
Strain HCoV-229E was first isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be implanted in the WI-38 lung cell.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of disease, including headaches, bleeding, nausea, and throat pain, followed by fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial sequences in the brain that are still coming along.
Clinical representation of HCOV-OC43 infection seems to be similar to HCoV-229E infection, which is symptomaticly indistinguishable from the pathogen infection of other respiratory pathways such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are spread all over the world and tend to be most broadcast during the winter in the current climate.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by illness for about 2 weeks.
On the basis of a human volunteer study, a healthy, infected HCoV-229E is mild.
Only a few patients with a weakened body immune system that shows heavy low-life respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first HCOV-related pandemic that has been documented well in human history and its etiological agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV-founded.
The first case SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiokok.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
Apart from the superintendent, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak of the burden of the virus on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myalgia, headaches, fevers, and nausea, followed by dyspnoea, coughs, and respiratory disturbances as further symptoms.
Limphopenia, abnormal heart tests, and kinase creatine enhancements are laboratory abnormalities that are common to SARS.
The damage caused by alveolar diffusion, epitel cell proliferation, and macrophage enhancements were also observed by SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal channels, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can cause death, especially in patients with a weak condition.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of the patient zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been tremendously dedicated to HCoV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was at first very common in young children, elderly people, and a weak patient who suffered from respiratory disease.
Coriza images, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronkiolitis are commonly found in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from an 8-month-old man's nasal specimen suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% general respiratory disease and the peak of the event occurred in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called the body.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-olds who had been treated for pneumonia and bronkiolites in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma abuse.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild breathing.
The four HCoVs of this entire community have been adapted with humans and generally have little chance of mutating into a highly pathogenic disease. However, the extraordinary case is true for unknown reasons, as in the case of the HCoV-NL63 subtype, more virulent recently reported caused serious respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend oneself within humans, these HCV virulence and pathogens are also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old lung patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, the import case with a time of secondary distribution to close contact has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical demonstration is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also suffered acute kidney failure, which so far has only occurred in MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
Over 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, over 2500 confirmed laboratory cases reported with high case death, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, a classer of retrospective pneumonia patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an infection of the current low-life line was caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death toll of 3.4%.
It needs to be recorded, death of a case in Hubei, Tiokok, amounting to 4.2%, while death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 caused heavy respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, coughing, and breathing.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop quickly into acute respiratory disorders.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homology, 82%, both of which flock to a different phylogenetic tree branch.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogonism is obviously lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the fast SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world.
Compared and distinguished SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs show a very interesting similarity and difference.
First, the incubation and duration of travel of HCV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCoV general train.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four other communities (like HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCoV infection in the Community, which includes a light or even unspecific picture of non-specific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small portion of the case of COVID-19 that is severe can look like SARS-CoV infection even though with a slightly lower ratio.
Three, SARS-CoV-2 transmissions also show interesting pattern characteristics, have similarities with both community HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as community HCoVs.
On the other hand, decreasing the capability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after some pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Last but not least, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a phase sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a given situation, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
What's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of HCoV community.
In any case, the image SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capacity, pathogenicity, and continuous circulation in some pathways in humans, will have a strong impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 plague.
Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be HCoV control species in ancient times.
HCOVs that cause serious illness to humans and people who experience severe HCVs have died.
In order for this to happen, HCOV must replicate in humans in sufficient amount to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to be used against an angel-restraint factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 disease survives and more people are infected, the more likely this virus is to be fully adapted with humans.
If the virus is well adapted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four CoV communities have moved into human populations and have triggered an omnipotence in people with immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic and do not adapt to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and do breeding in the zoonotic reservoir and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or some of the intermediaries and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like community HCOV, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still has to be observed if SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted with humans and channeled into humans without a resorptive or intermediate animal.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, resourceful, interstellar, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as an evolutionary swimmer HCoV if they have close relatives and share high homologies at the secondary level of nucleotide.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in this ring.
Similarly, the container’s fangs carry HCoVs on a continuous, long run.
In two cases, an insect naturally infected and is a natural ring for HCV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the middle of the brain right before or about when the virus enters humans, the virus is not adapted to new and often pathogenic.
This intercessor may act as a source of zoonotic human infection and act as a breeding enemy by enabling the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCOV may have a death infection if it cannot maintain transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to the intermediate angle and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the middle angel became a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveals that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with domestic animals.
Further studies of seroprevalence indicate that the animal salesman has a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Musang moon (Paguma Larvata) and raccoon dogs in the living animal market are the first to be identified with a similar virus-SARS-COV that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the murderers in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that the moon's weasel from wild or unscathed nature to the living animal market largely provides negative test results for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon's weasel may only act as an intermediate amply, but not a natural saRS-CoV resorb.
It needs to be noted, since 80% of the animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it can't be overlooked that many small mammal species may also function as an intermediate SARS-CoV clustering.
All this ring seems to be an end of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal for SARS-CoV next reveals a close-neighbored bat COV, which is called a Rhinolopus bat Rhinolopus relatives HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Tiokok horse bat bat.
This strain gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This CoV and other bat CoV share secondary nucleotide homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that bats are an angel for new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from bats, but only one, given the WIV1, can be isolated as living viruses.
The known angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, which comes from a bat-fees sample, is shown to be using ACE2 bats, musks, and humans as a receiver to enter the cells.
Interesting thing, the serum SARS convalesin can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% secondary nucleotide homology.
Apart from the extent of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV into a group that is the same as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bat and MERS-CoV use the same anang receptor, which is peptidedil 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry route.
The sequence of RNA polymerase depends-RNA MERS-CoV in phylogenetics closer to the beta-CoV of bats identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV lives are found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bat only share 87% secondary nucleotide homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir Mers-CoV.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East showed that Arab camels yielded seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nose of the Arab camel, indicating further that the camel is a real reservoir for the MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive virus delivery with symptoms that are usually mild to observe on the test camels that are infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, the infected camel carries the virus not only through the breathing route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route to the spread of the virus from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, the possibility of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with RaTG13 bat CoV which is isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be a direct reservoir SARS-CoV-2, except if the COV bats that are almost identical were found in later days.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 is among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Sea Coast. Many of the early cases of COVID-19 are linked to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmission of animals to humanity.
Some recent studies based on metallenomic sequence show that a group of endangered small mammals, known as trengilling (javanica manis), may also carry an ancestor beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new Genom CoV is sharing 85-92% secondary nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two sub-line viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-receptor-receptor-receptor-receptor-receptor-receptor-receptor-receptor-like domain (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid-like similarity.
Which is striking, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much more different, although the level of homology is consistent with the entire genome is higher.
Previous study in the diseased Trengilling also reported a viral contiguous detection of lung sample, which was also associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of delivery and manual grading to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% of complete virus genomes.
We can't rule out the possibility of twitching as one of the saRS-CoV-2 intermediate animals.
However, at present there is no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from trinkling due to a serious difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 dipping.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path in bats, trinkling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest secondary homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV patient-SARS-CoV-2 trenggling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were found to share highest homology at the secondary level of the entire genome.
Too speculative if it is said that the level of similarity between the beta-CoV RBD-SARS-CoV-2 kinship is perching and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a convergent evolution that is selectively at the same time.
The hypotheses of the comparison support the recombination between beta-CoV patient-SARS-CoV-2 trengilling and RaTG13 species of third wild animals.
As a driving force for evolution, a lot of recombinations occur between beta-CoVs.
Researchers still can't decide about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Apart from the highly pathogenic HCOV, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may come from bat coV, while the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent virus has been found in the feeder.
It is reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American three-colored bat indicates close to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to the other bat CoV, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae expected as well.
To make it clearer, today's knowledge of the origins of HCoV animals that are known to be contained in the brief picture 1 and Table 2.
phylogenetic analysis has given evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of animals to infect humans, it was reported that there was a pandemic of respiratory infection.
History of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them, there are alpha-CoV alpapapas.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from bats to humans.
First, human beings, not the alpacas, who may be involved with bats in the ecological loops together.
Humans, on the other hand, have a close contact with the alpacas.
Second, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCOV-229E are various and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the alpaca is likely to get alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E from humans that cannot be overlooked.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alpha-CoV bats function as a length of HCOV-229E gene, alpaca and Arab camels may function as an intermediate ring that transmits viruses to humans, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for the transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
As well as the Mers-CoV evolutionary of bats known in the early identification of the virus and also reinforced with subsequent discovery.
Clearly, bats are a long-range rich virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments of interspecies and interspecies transmission.
A long age, a close colony, a strong social interaction, and a strong flying capacity, all are conditions that support bats to be an ideal virus spread.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in Arabic for decades.
This virus has been adapted to a camel that has changed from the middle ring into a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happened by chance and man remains the ultimate angel for MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of trinkling, if any, in different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Above all, the beta-coV is highly pathogenic in treggilling.
Chewing may be a final angel for the beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, similar to a weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some of the possibilities of an interspecies SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans should be calculated or subtracted.
First of all, bats may be a reservoir for a SARS-CoV-2 kin virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological chalice with bats through smelting or rocking.
Second, trinkling could be one of the intercomming angles for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 kin virus.
Humans get viruses through meat processing and consumption.
It's possible, many mammals, which include pets, vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies survey of pets and wildlife needs to be done.
Three, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that compete well with bats and trinkling.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from various species of animals, three main factors on the side of the virus are also important to make it easier to pass through species barriers.
First, its relative rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to another single single RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "current" to "high" with the average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per step, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to the new ring.
CoV has an esoribonuklease of corrections, removals that result in very high mutations, attenuations, or even inviolability.
Interesting, Remdesivir nucleotide analogues are known to suppress the CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribunukase and RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutation is about one million times higher than the rate of the ring mutation.
In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoV is not adapted to an angel.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, with a higher level of adaptation for humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another ring that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV which has been adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, the small possibility that genetic hanyutut will quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 become ineffective.
Second, a large RNA genome in the CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of co-evolution of interspecies, which is advantageous to appear new COV under the appropriate conditions.
This is supported by a lot of open-label patterns and protein functions that are indented to the end of 3′ genome.
Three, CoV repeatedly changes the template randomly during RNA replication through unique "choice-salin" mechanisms.
In a ring that functions as a mixing vessel, the rotation of the butter usually occurs during the RNA CoV transcription.
Full RNA and very homologous subgenomics can experience a recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in COV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of viruses in connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, virus interactions with anang receptor are another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recommendation is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the occurrence of antspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and musks, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various angels, especially with mutations in S-Protein RBD.
Generally, RBD S CoV protein interacts with the receptor cells and is an intensive target of an antibodies response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid from 318 to 510 in S1, which is connected to human ACE2 and the co-receptor as a virus entry route.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, musks, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing transmission of the interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differ between human virus isolates and musks in RBD and 4 of them are located on receptor retention grounds for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV mutants have K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which may increase the affinity of protein toxins interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit involved S protein binding affinity with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity of human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is whether there's any other co-receptor that might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 is also connected with ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N aminopeptidesis for HCoV-229E and 9-O-terasetylase acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of the animal's fan.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of HCoV interspecies transmission is also regulated by the dependency factors and other decompression.
The difference of this angel protein between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and predatory animals can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV must take over the dependence factor and break down an angel containment factor in order to succeed in the interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular assessors in the area of the interactions of these important viruses still need to be identified and defined.
Coverage of the entire genome is inexpensive to see the dependence and containment of the SARS-CoV-2 islands using advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCoV appearance: return to the beginning of the plague
A bat-cooling CoV's kind of gave us a great opportunity to show up in the new HCoV.
In this case, bat CoV functions as a long HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also motivate HCoV evolution and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, tracking or losing the gene of a new protein-supply might potentially modify phenotype viruses dramatically.
Among the SARS-CoV-accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in adapting to humans because of the virus of distant relatives-SARS-CoV, which is found to contain various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with special characteristics of 29 nucleotide removals found on strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports annihilation.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineage, with a number of smaller areas of recommendation identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Location of recombination was also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and part nsp14.
Likewise, the rebirth of various genera is reported in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV has been recombined with other COV animals in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be observed that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes to viral genomes, possibly resulting from the release of virus from the selective pressure experienced, such as the immune system.
This example of effect is the complete ORF4 on strain prototype HCoV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in a bat and camel virus related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpata shows a single nucleotide side that leads to a range shift.
Finally, new HCoV evolution was also driven by the pressure of selection in his reservoir.
Light or undetected symptoms are detected when the bat is infected with CoV, which shows adaptations between CoV and bats.
Looks like bats fit well with CoVs in anatomy and physiology.
For example, disabling the active pro-inflammation response on bats will effectively lower the pathology of CoV.
In addition, natural killer cell activity on bats is pressed by the rise in the regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptors and the molecular expression level complex histocompatibilities of the lower I class.
In addition, the high rate of reactive oxygen (ROS) species of high bat metabolic activity can suppress the replication of CoV and influence correction by exoribonuklease so that it exerts selective pressure on the generation of a highly pathogenic strain of strains when entering a new ring.
More pathogenic Strain CoV may also develop through recombination, which results in protein benefits or new protein features for the adaptation of the dragon.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two bases.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in his reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV is heavily replicated without triggering a strong anginal immune response.
Here lies the secret of the absence of symptoms and the cause of serious human infection.
Especially heavy symptoms because of excessive immune response and cytokine storms, with increased lung damage if the immune response becomes stronger.
On the contrary, on the carrier without symptoms, immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the immune connection might be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the interferon type I gift, at least at the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be beneficial in the control of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appearances follow the general direction of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also COV bats that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although some other prey and animals at the market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, a direct intercom for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV trending a very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that trengilling may play as one of the intermediate or beta-CoV trengilling can contribute to the gene fraction in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by humans either knowingly or unintentionally.
CoV is back into the center of attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 plague.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perceptions of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal storage for HCVs on human transmission.
Many evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and is transmitted to humans through an intermediate ring.
Considering that SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and wetlands in the market, it may close the wet market and kill all the wetlands in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trengling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, considering the discovery of some beta-coV strains that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism are transmitted to humans through tremors and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arabic camels.
It works as an important transport tool as well as as as as a main source for meat, milk, skin, and product wol for the local community.
Arab cattle spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an outbreak.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs leaving in the wild.
Especially, coV bats that are potentially zoonotic are very varied.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in the emergence of a new coV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China had to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and development plans must be put into practice.
Actually, a lot of viruses have been on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in his natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, human opportunities run counter to bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wildlife.
The continuing surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the CoV ecology and its natural ring, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and future plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonosis of the virus is for humans to keep their distance from ecological strains of natural zoonotic viruses.
Some parts of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzles have not been found yet.
First of all, if bat transmits SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus to trengilling, the condition when bats and peering share ecological elongations is important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans interact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there's a third mammal acting as an actual midwife, the way the mammal interacts with another species, which includes humans, bats, and thinning needs to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, either attempted infection and surveillance should be performed.
Whether bats, twitching, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its mother's nearly identical virus can be identified in its natural ants in the future.
Further investigation in this field will outline the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathway in animals, with important implications in prevention and control of the COVID-19 in humans.
Update of "expected case" diagnostic criteria and "confirmed case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick guidance for the diagnosis and management of new 2019 coronavirus infections (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to combating pandemics worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "the suspect case" and "confirmed case" based on the Guide Diagnosis and Handling for COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) corronavirus has caused a plague, which is now formally called a 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called a kronavirus heavy akat breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed fast advice guidelines and these guidelines have been published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
They have been a source of much interest since publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge that is increasingly based on ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are being updated as well.
For example the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19, issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tyokok (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has produced a total of seven editions with some of the contexts changed considerably.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal for simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds to the new evidence for our guide and serves as a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
Even so, their work requires updating based on the Diagnostics and Handling Guidelines for COVID-19, the latest (test seventh version) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the alleged case requires a combination of one epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to perform comprehensive analysis, or to perform three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or stay in Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the storm; (2) contact history with the SARS-CoV-2 case (with positive nuclear assay); (3) contact history with patients who experience fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the emergency; (4) contact history with the qualified confirmed case (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or breathing symptoms that occur in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) citriculation features COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood count shows normal lymphocyte counts, decreases, or decreases at early awake stages.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire virus genome shows high homogeneity for known new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or change of specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negative to positive, or titer increases ≥4 liters at the restoration phase at acute stage.
We can see that the real-time nucleic acid PCR tests in the sample of the respiratory or blood channel are added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on further research by researchers to find optimal nucleat acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood collection, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the detection of certain positive antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there is more evidence to remind us to keep an eye on the patient with a tidal and no symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s al. chart needs to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in future.
In closing, we hope that more immediate evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the "expected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend following and following the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance on time as help is needed.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily mortality rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
It's the highest death rate in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 home-based cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In an overview of the online news, the director of FDICR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death covered four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of those who died was the Saifur Rahman Road, director of Bengali Anti-Corupsi Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridge, Oaidul Quader said that public transportation would be stopped longer than planned until Saturday comes.
This general transportation stop has started since March 26th and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident reported in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two new returnees from Italy and one of their wives.
On March 19, those three men were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of corona virus infection SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by a Crown virus.
The focus was on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first crown virus infection and Zambia had its first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the infection of the Crown virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, it is reported that there are over 244,000 cases of Crown virus, which results in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, which cites Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by crown virus infection.
Around the world, countries are announcing stricter action to prevent disease spread.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended forty districts until May 1st.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would remain paid without going to work until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament made the vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the sound was released with 215 supporting voices, ten abstinence voices, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia extends the nighttime in the holy city of Mecca and Madinah to the full; before, the night was only between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand plans to apply nighttime between 10am and 4am.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1st.
Australia's store-toko lowers the purchase limit of the toilet tissue for transactions
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australia Woolworth and Coles network each lowered the purchase limits of toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one sir, on Monday.
This exception was announced as a message in the casserole and on the Facebook page of the network.
Buyers are reported to increase supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 if society has to make independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper to send home to one pack per order.
This change follows the limitation of four packs per transaction previously applied Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the abolition of the four packs, "many shops have been running out in an hour since the shipment", and he called that request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
Last week's sharp-up sales, according to one of the speakers speaking Woolworths.
The Costco Store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed up to two weeks ago.
To avoid a shortage, Coles ordered larger packaging than a vendor and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of Australia's Steel Association, said that the oil was trying to increase the supply, but the local government's limit for the time of the truck delivery made it difficult.
He looked forward to the increase in production costs, while the vendors tried to meet the demands, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since it had released earlier supplies, some stores could not make Wednesday special.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a rite specialist from Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled supplies every night.
He stressed that the toilet tissue was a huge material so that the amount of supplies were low and, if sold out, made a lot of empty space in the racks so that the volume of the goods became more expensive.
Coles and Woolworths feel [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if a product like a toilet tissue and a penance can be [bought] and there's a huge amount, anxiety may be minimized, assuming Russel Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The producer of the red-red toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made tissue Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which made Sorbent, stressed that they worked 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet paper to the first auction auctioner in Melbourne, when less auctions were held because the buyer took a break for long vacation weekend workers.
The Thursday NT News edition, a diary printed in Darwin, lists eight pages of a panel that are meant to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The stores actually refused to apply the limits, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3, they said that they were not planning on applying the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also in high demand, including masks, treatment, dry food, soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British Ocado supermarket was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs containing 12 scrolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—disease caused by corronavirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how many diseases have spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic trip.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and immobilizes its people in response, extorts Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very good at the level of the preaching and the fearlessness that were both of us due to the level of a fearsome array of actions.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center of Control and Prevention of Disease, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a record published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no virus of breathing that has ever been tracked from its onset to continuing global circulation."
Hebreysus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by corronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status is following WHO's decision in January that declared the plague as a deterioration of society that divides the world.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the point is that this plague is going to worsen."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reports there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that continues and is caused by akut 2 akut breathing syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The earthquake was identified in Wuhan, Tiokok, in December 2019, was reported as a global Health Disease that was released on January 30, 2020, and was listed as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The number of fatalities is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common disorders include fever, cough, and breath.
Complications can include tight breathing pneumonia and syndrome.
Time from exposure to thunderstorms is generally about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive measures that are recommended include washing hands, closing mouths when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolation of individuals who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by making travel restrictions, quarantine, nighttimes, hazardous workplace control, and shut down facilities.
The pandemic has caused major global economic social unrest, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and the vastness of supply that is fueled by panic.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there are xenophobia and discrimination incidents against the Tionghoa people, people with offspring and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from the area with significant viruses.
The loss of travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions fell.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiokok (the hub of Hubei propensity), reported a classer case of pneumonia with unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and investigated in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Grosir Coast Food Juanan and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, the newly found virus and associated with the kronavirus bat, the corronavirus is ringing, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with the symptoms then known fell ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no obvious connection to the next wet market classer.
Among the early case classers reported in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to have a relationship with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old from the province of Hubei, was likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported falling in Tiokok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of Tiokuk had exceeded the number of new cases in Tiokok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds coming down to form 2.4% cases around the world. UK Scientific Advisor Raya, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before the group's immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and the results of the tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23th, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infection was undetected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A research published by the United States Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases concludes that it is possible 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who are not healed, time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, some 97,000 deaths have been associated with the COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have previous health disorders, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Real mortality rates from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official numbers may not indicate the deaths of untested people, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count with a factor 4-5 times thick.
A female speaker for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention admits, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by non-billion reports about the calculations too low in the U.S.. too low avalanche often appears in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 pig flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuh on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Tiokuk took place on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14th.
By February 28th, outside the land of China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, over forty countries and territories have reported death on every continent, except Antarctica.
This number varies by region and time, and is influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, type of sex, and overall health. The ratio of death to the case reflects the number of deaths in the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the case overall is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In China, the ratio of death to the case has decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Another decrease includes the number of fatalities (CFRs), which reflect the percentage of those diagnosed with a specific disease, and the number of fatalities of infection (IFRs), which reflect the percentage of people with infections (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who die from a particular disease.
This statistic is timeless and following a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Center for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of fatalities infection for the entire pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is the result of the first random testing for the COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyses the impact of the CFR test.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The top and end of the plague is unclear and may be different depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Without control, contagious epidemics usually set off and then began to drop when the disease ran out of available swimmers.
However, it's almost impossible to make a sensible projection right now about when it happens."
Senior Medical Counsellor Tiokkok Zhong Nanshan concluded that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, likely until one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical restraint and other steps will be required "so that vaccines are available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear all of it" and this disease may become a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Replication viruses will depend on group immunity and mutation level.
CoVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and people who are infected can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
An unusual condition includes fatigue, the production of the breathputum (fragma), the loss of the sense of smell, breathing, pain of the joints and the muscles, throat pain, headache, headache, vomiting, hemoptissis, diarrhoea, or serasis. WHO states that about one out of six people is severely ill and has difficulty in breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, depressed chests or chest pain settled, sudden confusion, walking disorders, and lip and face disorders; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms appear. Further development of disease may be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic sychetic syndrome, and death.
Some infected people may be asymtomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confirmed to be infected should be monitored closely and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate the asymtomatic ratio of a few to 44%.
Incubation periods (when between infections and symptoms) usually range from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty, estimated number of COPID-19 sufferers who lost initial kissing 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease has spread are still examined.
The COVID-19 service is believed mainly to occur at close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 ft).
Research found that uncovered coughs could cause droplets to drop by 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced while talking. Breath droplet can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although this virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of someone close to him or maybe inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung (RJP), can cause a respiratory secret to turn into an aerosol and spread through the air.
It can also happen when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through a phase, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of Tyokok is dreaming of the possibility of fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the clock, although the circulation may occur before the symptoms appear and at the stages of further disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the clock, which signal transmission may occur before there are significant symptoms.
Only a few asymtomatic case reports are confirmed in the laboratory, but asymtomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during the search of contact.
The Center for European Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and 304-cart steel, one day on card, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have been affected by the infected.
Koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with the classer case acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are newly associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it has a household soap, which moves its protective envelopes.
The virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the genetically classified coronavirus with the genus Beacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (by line B) along with two bats.
This virus has 96% in the entire genome with other bat-coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researchers Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome between the
Until now, the comparison of the entire genome has found the most 92% of the genetic matter between corronavirus tingilling and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that emitting is the saRS-CoV-2 intermediate ring.
Virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation in the end is made by the reaction of the reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) to an infected secret or via CT capture.
A research that compares PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT significantly is more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the many traits that overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first released on January 17.
Testing uses the reaction of the actual-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a breath or blood sample.
The results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasopharynx, but it can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by a certified laboratory.
The characteristics of the computed X-ray rendering and tomography (CT) in a symptomatic person include the ground glass peripheral asymmetry opacity and no pleura efusi.
The Italian Radiological Society is building an international database for the findings of the imaging on confirmed cases.
Because the patient has increased with other infections such as adenovirus, an unconfirmed imaging PCR has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tyokok compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although not specific for infections, the imaging process was faster and more sensitive so that it was recommended to be considered a screening tool in the epidemic area.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the features of the transcription of the virus with radiographs and CT.
Strategy to prevent the spread of this disease includes keeping good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue when coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing tissue into trash.
People who may be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical restraints are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or resorted to stopping all non-essential journeys to and from affected countries and regions.
However, the virus has reached a scale in society in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected.
The use of the location data from the phone by the government for this purpose has triggered privacy issues, with the release of the statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance limitation.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts have worked out a friendly privacy solution, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance to another phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for the COVID-19.Leave a misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, brushing the nose and chewing off with an ineffective turtle drug.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing your hands is encouraged to prevent disease from spreading.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after spreading their noses, coughs, or sweating.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a household soap that damaged its protective layer.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand-services with a low alcohol content of at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends not touching the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing the hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of laratives (in one minute disinfected patterns for low-carbon surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, natrium hypochlorit 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other streams, such as benzalkonium chlorida and chlorhexidine glukonat, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in the public facility, such as office or childcare, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablets, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machine used by the sufferer, they should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with whipped elbows or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately remove the tissue.
Surgeons recommended for people who may have been infected because using masks can limit volume and length of the expiratory droplets that are spread when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on time and manner of wearing masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce people's tendency to touch faces with insufficiently clean hands, which is a source of primary transmission."Masker also recommended to be used by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat the patients of COVID-19, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medicine masks made of cloth. Thirkok specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used in a healthy society, especially when about 1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transportation or living in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make home cloth masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned the public from going out to the public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they went to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has forced everyone who entered the toaster to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, obliging train passengers and city buses to wear face masks for April 1st.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the house, and recommends the creation of artificial face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also called physical restraint) is an act of infection control that is meant to slow the spread of disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quarantine; restriction of travel; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Social exclusion can be applied by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding communities, using greetings without contact, and keeping the physical distance from others.
At present, many governments are obligating or claiming social restraint in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people regated by U.S. government bodies and health organization rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if unknown as far as COVID-19 is concerned) became 50 people, and then 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. The elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the troubled immune system that were at risk of serious illness and higher complications are advised to CDC as much as possible at home as possible in areas with an outbreak at the level of society. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health care agencies began to change their use of the term "social barrier" to "physical limitations", to clarify that its goal is to reduce physical contact with maintaining social relations, either in virtual or distant ways.
The use of the term "social exclusion" implies that people must completely isolate themselves socially and do not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative ways.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with the person who lives with you and does not have a virus or a virus condition.
Self-sustainment in the home is recommended for those diagnosed with COPID-19 and suspected of being infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for the right isolation, and many governments are obliged or recommending the independent quarantine for all populations in the affected areas.
The strictest independent quarantine instruction is issued for people of high risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to the country or region with extensive COVID-19 distribution are advised to do independent quarantine for 14 days from the last possible time.
The strategy in the control of the plague is support or suppression, and mitigation.
Reliance is done at the early stage of the plague and is intended to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infections and vaccinations that aim to stop spreading disease to the entire population.
When there is no longer any way to spread the disease, the next effort turns to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching process and reduce its impact on the health and society care system.
Combination of mitigation and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.The amount of the management of infectious diseases is to try to unravel the top of the epidemic, which is known to trigger an epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of failure in health services and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the disease include individual prevention, such as hand-cleaning, wearing face masks, and independent quarantine; steps at the level of society intended for physical containment, such as closing the school and cancelling the mass gathering; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleansing.
Other countries also apply various steps to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces local mass and quarantine, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who do independent quarantine and wear huge fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and punishes the farmers of medical supplies. Simulations for England and the United States indicate that mitigation (drinking, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reverseing the growth of the epidemic) has a major challenge.
Optimum mitigation policy can reduce the peak of demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and an unmanageable health system.
Depression may be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to dissipate in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is first reached), because otherwise, the transmission will slide back rapidly as the suppression steps are delayed.
Long-term interventions to push the pandemic have an impact on social and economics.
There's not yet a specific anti-virus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development efforts are being made, which includes an existing drug test.
Absorbing free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of decency, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen patient conditions.
Some of the animals previously approved for treatment of another virus disease are being studied to be used in treating COPID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home affairs" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that improving the capacity and adopting health services for patients' needs COVID-19 is a fundamental step in responding to the disease.
ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources from various levels, including focussing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive patients COVID-19, and increase intensive care skills with personal training and increase fan numbers and sleeping rooms.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called the zero patient).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiokok.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose gradually.
Most of these cases are related to the Huananan Sea Food Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police because of spreading counterfeit villages, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his superiors for the warning he had issued.
The Whah City Health Commission then released an announcement to the public on December 31 and told WHO.
Sufficiently many unrecognised cases of pneumonia are reported to the health authorities in Wuhan that then triggered the investigation in early January. At the early stage of the plague, the number of cases increases twice every seven and a half days.
In the early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of Tiokok, supported by migration during the New Year Imlek and because Wuhan was the transport center and main railway transit.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
By 26 March, the United States has surpassed Tiokok and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, over 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area limit free movement and control the borders.
National reports cover measures of quarantine, such as housing orders, shelter orders, or quarantine hours.

In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the SARS plague in 2002-04.
An estimate from Washington University experts in St. Louis stated that the plague has affected more than $300 billion on the world supply chain, which can last for two years.
The Earth Mining Exports Organization (OPEC) reported "kucar-chire" after the price of earth oil has dropped sharply as a result of the reduced demand from Tiokok.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of the land of China.
On February 27th, due to increased concerns about the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 indexes, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded sharp decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, one largest day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
Those three stock indexes close the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH denied the Tiokkok government credit rating, but maintained its negative Outlook.
Again anecdotals are due to the fear of coronavirus, the greatest decline occurred on March 16th.
A lot of people think economic recession might happen.
Econom Mohamed El-Erian commends the urgent steps of central bank and timely state.
The central bank reacted faster than they did at the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected by travel bans, the closing of the public places, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many airliners cancelled flights because of the slightest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
Stunning in the travel industry is at the level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and railway ports were also closed.
The epidemics coincide with Chunyun, the main travel season related to New Year's Eve Imlek.
A number of events involving many people were canceled by the central and district governments, including the New Year’s Festivals, and private companies were also able to shut down shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s Eve events and tourist sites were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Unauthorized City of Beijing and traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 out of 31 provinces, the city of the state, and the territory of Tiokok, authorities extended the New Year to February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until the date.
These areas are 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increases the removal of disease to the highest level and announces emergency conditions, closes school until March, and cancels New Year's celebration. Ritual sectors are globally affected by the reduction of working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to European and Latin America's dry cleaners fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Easterners have decreased by 50–60%.
It also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to the shopping center in March compared to February.
The world's shopping malls take additional steps, such as an increase in health care, the introduction of the ultimate examination of the market temperature, and the cancellation of the event, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the recession can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people in comparison with the situation without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, during the fall of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were displaced from homes in the remote or trapped provinces of Hubei. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a kronavirus epidemic may cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the level of employment can reach 32%. The quarantine area in India has resulted in tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages). Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some kind of job loss. Almost 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since it was done forty-five regions in the mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers filed temporary unemployment payments and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany filed a short-term work programme for the government, known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term employment compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the industry of show arts and cultural heritage is deeply affected by pandemics, which affect the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
The art and culture sector organization strives to uphold their high mission (often funded by the public) to provide cultural heritage access to society, to maintain the safety of employees and society, and to support artists if possible.
By March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, shows, and other cultural institutions were closed timelessly, with exhibitions, shows, shows, and shows canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are forced to provide alternative services through digital platforms. As this is another disease that is new and very rapidly developed is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disturbances. The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which fell on the last week of the Christian restoration season, was canceled.
Many churches encourage Christian seniors to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, direct broadcasts or television, while others offer the worship of drive-in or Awake!
With the closure of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic Crucifix and the removal of it from the Holy Peters of Christian pilgrims, other bodies of religion also canceled the service and restricted public meetings in the church, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurders.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the plague and the places of worship closed, while Saudi Arabia forbids the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants into sacred places in the Mosque and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the League of UEFA Champions 2019-2020, the League of Premier 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-2020, and the NHL 2019-2020.
This earthquake fucked up the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until 2020, but not more than the summer 2021."All over the world, casinos and other games are closed and the direct broadcast of poker tournaments is delayed or canceled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with music groups delaying or canceling the concert tour.
Many large theaters like Broadway also delay all shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative for direct traditional performances, such as live live live live concerts or make web-based "festival" for artists to perform, spread, and publish their works.
Many of the Internet’s themes of coronavirus are spread over the Internet with many people turning to humor and attention in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tunghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and widespread hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report of February (when most cases are still limited in Tiokok) notes the racist sentiment revealed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoes deserve the virus or receive what they claim as a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiokok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their background.
There's support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for people in areas with viruses.
In response to the outbreaks to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe with a serious COVID-19 disease, could also be suspected and xenophobia. People in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition prohibiting the Tunghoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan became a Twitter train.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported an increase in racist and assault harassment.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Virus Tiokok", a term that critics considered to be racist and anti-Tiok.
Fountains in Ukraine attacked buses that brought Ukrainians and aliens evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordered with Tiokok, and learning in large Indian cities are reported to have been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus plague.
The President of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a state unit in the West Begalga Dilip Ghosh, states that Tiokkok has destroyed nature and "that's why God takes vengeance on them."
That statement was then threatened by the Turkish Consulate in Kolkata, calling it a "misleader". In Thongkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Thionghoa people are spreading by pandemics, with strangers being described as "foreign garbage" and being targeted for "conveyance".
Many of the newspapers who use paid expressions have deleted them for some or all of their corronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made the scientific realm available with open access.
Some scientists choose to distribute results quickly on printer servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects the presence of the virus and detects the antibodies produced as a response to infection.
There is a virus in the sample confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus only.
This test is used to confirm a new infection or is still active.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibodies test shows how many people have been infected, including those with symptoms too light to report or without symptoms.
The mortality rate of an accurate disease and the level of group immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of the limited testing, by March 2020, no country has any background data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of case fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of the actual-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on the breathing sample obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx orputum sample.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on the grooves can only be relied on during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for people who are infected on the second week, sample material can be taken from the inhalation channel by using the isap or the substance that is extracted through the sputum.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reaction of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
English Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a CRP-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerCheck Coronavirus) pensation device that was a clinnist on 28 January 2020.
This device is looking for an "E" gene that has all beta coronavirus, and a specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive the approval of emergency use from the Tiokok National Medical Product Administration for SARS-CoV-2 pensation device based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Real-Time Koronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to a community health laboratory via the International Reagent Resource.
One out of three genetic tests on old version tests yielded unconvinced results due to reactive errors, and the number of CDC tests in Atlanta limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components considered to be unreliable until February 28, 2020, and after that the state laboratory and the local laboratory are permitted to perform tests.
This test was approved by the United States Drug and Food Supervisor based on Authorization of Emergency Use. The U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a national-level RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics conducted nationally available COVID-19 testing on March 9, 2020.
No amount limit was announced; collection and processing of the specimen must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the tests were registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a 3,5 hour trial with high volume so that a machine could do about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA authorized the use of emergency (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing in the m2000 Abbott system; FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to Holic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received US from FDA for a 45-minute test.
FDA has approved testing using isothermal nucleat acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because there is no need for a series of temperature replacement cycles, this method can yield positive results within only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipate to increase production by up to 50,000 trials per day. Tests that use monochlonal antibodies that specifically bind the new nucleocapsid protein (N protein) coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hopefully can yield results within 15 to 20 minutes as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photothoracs have a small diagnostic value at the early stage, as the CT [computed tomography] may already exist before the clock."
Special features on the CT include bilateral multi-glass-ground opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior.
Subpleura dominasis, cracy terror, and consolidation are formed as disease develops.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with CT at the current pandemic point shows that CT significantly is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many facial imaging features that overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."On March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. The check can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or through point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but the availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is generally used as a peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it is generally used one specimen of the periphery's blood that was obtained through a skin prick.
Unlike the PCR method, an extraction step was not required prior to the examination. On 26 March 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 institutions that provided notification to the agency as needed and that could now distribute their antibodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on authorisation of emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their IgG and IgA antibodies testing devices against viruses in the blood sample.
The test capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after weaning infection. In early April, Raya found that none of the antibodies they bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong developed a scheme to enable the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a specimen tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. The British NHS announces that NHS is pioneering the suspected case test regimen at home so that it will remove the risk of the patient driving others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect ambulances if they are used. On a state-of-the-art examination for the suspected case COVID-19, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate precautions.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germans said that Germany had about 12,000 tests per day in road traffic and 10700 tests had been done on the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if a doctor's test is required.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, Awake!
By 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, overall, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital develop and test methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if a pool sample was found positive. In Wuhan, the emergency survey laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: , or "Api Eye" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction monitored by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the modernization showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine management could double if this test capacity did not exist.
Wuhan laboratory soon followed by the Huo-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, its total capacity of 50,000 daily tests. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patients' samples for COPID-19 using only 93 checks. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without needing robotic fluids.
Until the month of March, lack of sufficient reagents has been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers seek to explore sample testing protocols involving sample heating at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirates reported doing more coronavirus tests by population captains than any country, and ready to increase the testing scale for most populations.
This is achieved through a combination of state-of-the-art testing and mass-sales of laboratory population of Group 42 and BGI (based on the laboratory of emergency detection "Huo-Yan" in Tiokok).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various testing recipes that target parts of the coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted German prescriptions for the production of testing devices sent to low-income countries without any resources to develop itself.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until January 28, so that it slowed down the testing available in the United States. In the beginning of the plague, Tiokok and the United States had a problem with the occurrence of the testing device; these two countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demand and recommendation of medical specialists.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive testing available in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Test capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratory, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization identified an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow down the increase of the COVID-19 pandemic. High requests for testing due to the widespread spread of viruses cause hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for the US private laboratory, and the supply of usp and chemical reagents to become scary.
By March 2020, Tiokkok reported the problem of accuracy on their tests.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test tool has a "decat"; the government then removes the bureaucratic obstacle that prevents testing by private individuals. The Spanish buys the testing tool from the Tiokong Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd company, but finds that the results are not accurate.
The company explained that the result may be a failure in collecting samples or using tests properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would pull out the wrong-doing equipment and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiokokkk, and Slovakia bought 1.2 million tests from Tiokko.
Prime Minister Matovič recommends that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the tests purchased by Turkey from Tiokok had "high levels of error" and they did not "use it". British Raya bought 3.5 million tests from Tiokok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of positive tested people and tracking of people who contact positive people SARS-CoV-2, yields positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the first death location due to the COVID-19 in Italy, did two rounds of testing on the entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days.
About half of the positive tested had no symptoms, and all cases were found in quarantine.
By restricting travel to this community, new infections are completely eliminated.
By tracking aggressive contacts, redundancy of entry, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore grows much slower than other developed countries, even without extreme restraints, such as the closure of restaurants and ritual companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened on March 23rd.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics of aggressive contact, forced entry, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower mortality rate, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people with mild or untimely symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive samples COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, and 1 is in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "positive test result" was influenced by the country's testing policy.
The country that only tests people in the hospital will have % higher positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factors.
Washing hands, which is also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleansing a person’s hand that intends to remove dirt, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at a certain "critical time" throughout the day prevents many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, transmitted through a fecal-oral route.
People may also be suffering from respiratory disease, such as influenza or fever, if they do not wash their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucosa membrane).
Five days a critical day that is very important to wash your hands with soap is: before and after a great shower, after cleaning a child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or cooking meat, fish, or raw garlic.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning kids who just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving you medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce disease spread.
The main purpose of the medicine is to wash hands from the pathogens (bacterial, virus, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses, and other contagious diseases; preventing the cause of contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
and reduce infant mortality at home.
Studies carried out in 2013 indicate that the increase in handwashing can increase a little.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as by washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low - intake areas.
48% of the reduction in diare cases can be associated with soap washing. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infection of acute respiratory tract (ISPA), as a low-level behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one death of children; it causes the death of some 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets can save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and reducing death from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory tract infection by a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene program (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from the empetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
The minor side effects of washing hands are often done to cause skin damage due to skin removal.
Studies carried out in Denmark in 2012 found that overwashing can cause the skin of the caterpillar and the cystic skin, which is known as a hand or hand dermatitis, especially among health workers.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCDs).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease, which is: before and after using toilets (small water, big water), after cleaning child’s buttocks, before feeding children, before eating and before preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw butter.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing hands to prevent disease from spreading is before and after taking care of the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal shit or handling animals; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the level of soap - washing is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that the average of 38.7% households practice soap washing. A study in 2014 shows that Saudi Arabia has the highest level at 97 percent; the United States is nearly in the middle of 77 percent; and Tiokok at the lowest level at 23 percent. There are now some methods of changing behaviors to improve the adoption of the practice of soap washing hands at critical times. Washing group hands for students at a time that has been determined is one of the choices in developing countries to habitually wash hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Education Department in the Philippines provides an example of balanced action to support health and education for children.
Twice a year, plus washing hands each day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleansing of the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to the seas and increase the traffic.
Water is an inefficient skin cleaning because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easily absorbed in water.
Nevertheless, fat cleaning and protein are helped by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, because of its re-useable characteristics, may contain bacteria obtained from previous uses.
A small number of studies that investigate the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that transfer cannot occur because bacteria are infected with foam.
Even so, the CDC continues to state that "the liquid garden that takes it out of the container without touching the hand is preferred."
The anti-fire soap is greatly encouraged by a healthy society.
So far, there is no evidence that antiseptic or disinfection use is better recommended for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, the anti-bacterial soap contains general anti-war agents such as triklosan, which have a list of foreign, long - held organisms.
So, even though an antibiotic-resistant strain is not targeted by the antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, advanced formulations may contain acid (ascetic acid, assay acid, ascorbate acid) as pH, benzoate acid as active antimicrobials, and more skin conditioners (oil, vitamins, mentols, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon Health Faculty shows that soap is as effective as the usual with the consumer antibacterial soap that contains tricycles in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hand.
The warm water that is comfortable to wash your hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm drinking water is more effective than cold drinking water in removing natural oil that holds dirt and bacteria.
However, backwards with the belief of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand care or antiseptics are non-water-based cleaning agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the agents of hand hygiene were non-water-based alcoholics (also referred to as alcoholic-based hand-doers, antiseptic hand-washers, or hand-services) becoming known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on alcohol or ethanol isopropyl, which is formalized together with agents such as Carbonmer (acrylate acid polymer) becoming gels or with moisture such as glycerin becomes liquid or foam to be easily used and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
Increased hydrogen peroxide nitrogen increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand-held care contains at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Alcohol treatment is sometimes used to kill bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol treatment that contains 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 decrease, similar to 35 decibels) bacteria in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hand 1 minute after use. Most effective hand care against bacteria and not effective against some viruses.
Manual treatment based on alcohol almost entirely is not effective for norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause for contagious gastroenteritis. Hand-based antiseptics or alcoholics in sufficient quantities should be used to immerse or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of both hands and in the saddle and end of all fingers rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The tip of the finger must also be washed well by rubbing it on two palms, and the control and prevention centre of the U.S. disease is more recommended for washing hands instead of hand-washing, especially when the hands are dirty.
Improving the use of service agents because of the ease of use and the rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, pen-patients should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing, except soap and water not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand-services can often cause dry skin, unless the emolian and/or skin-restraints are added to the formula.
Drying effects from alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolynic to formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based treatment of the hands that contain hemoli has caused irritation and skin loss to be much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergent.
Dermatitis allergic contact, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive substance in handcuffing is rare.
The lower decrease causes the dermatitis of contact that interferes with the pull of this product compared with washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean hands from organic matter, but just disinfect it.
For this reason, it is not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in the hands.
Honesty of freehand alcohol depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcoholics.
Recently, a formulation using benzalkonium chlorida has proven to have a continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be reduced after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities are unable to afford soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns was that, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes might increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfection agent because, if contact with water, ashes will form alkalis.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
Technique washes the right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Center to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
A handy bath with a flowing hot or cold water.
Water is recommended as a result of the slow water supply that may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems unaffected.
Put your hand through it with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingernails, and under your fingernails.
Soap raises palms from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water only.
Gosok at least 20 seconds.
Crushing creates a tremor, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer to remove more germs.
The scale is accurately below the water flowing.
Chopping in the bakom can cause contaminating hands back.
Dry it with a dry lips or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and wet feet are easier to recontaminate. The most frequently passed area is thumbs, wrists, sections between fingers, and under nails.
The open-cut nail and the loose fingernails can keep microorganisms.
Bleeding lotion is often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing of hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, e.g., flowing water from the syringe or bottle that hangs and holes and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when supply of limited water (such as school or rural areas in developing countries), there is a water solution, such as "tippy-tap", and other low-cost options.
Keran tippy is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hanging from a rope, a lever operated by a foot to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective handshake is an important part of the process of hand hygiene, but there is a debate about the most effective form of handwashing in the public toilet.
The more research shows that paper lap is much cleaner than the electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper lap industry European Tise Symposium, to compare the level of paper cleaning, warm air dryer, and more moderate jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the fingers books and 254% in the palms.
Exhausted by jet air dryers caused a total increase of 42% in the total number of bacteria in the fingers books and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying by paper, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the books and 77% in the palms of the hands.The scientist also conducted tests to determine the potential of cross contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of method of drying.
The jet air dryer, which sprays the air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can blow the microorganism from the hand and the unit and potentially defile the other toilet user and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air dryers spread microorganisms up to 0,25 meters from the dryers.
Paper Lap shows no significant microorganism distribution. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of handing were evaluated.
After switching, the following number of bacteria is observed:
There are many hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared to the dryers by using paper laptops.
Washing hands with hand-serving tissue is alternative for traveling if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand care must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital.
There's an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection was reduced by the use of the device.
Medical washing was done for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to soften and rub each part.
Hands have to be rubbed off each other with fingers bound to each other.
If there's shit under the nails, the fur belt can be used to remove it.
Because the palms can survive in the water in their hands, the hands need to be carefully trimmed and dried with clean lips.
After dryness, the paper is used to shut down the water tap (and open the door if necessary).
This act avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The goal of washing hands in health care is to remove pathogen microorganisms (“skulls”) and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing is still at a level that is not widely accepted in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forget to wash their hands before touching the patient so that the microorganism can be transmitted.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the rate of infection of blood flow related to a catheter to 66 percent.
The WHO’s clean hand concept can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant survey by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if compliance with rules is demonstrated.
The World Health Organization has five moments to wash its hands:
after being exposed to blood/water in the body
Before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, an addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap or antimicrobial soap is used to kill the handwash.
The kill function may be desired before a surgeon or in a situation when an organism that holds antibiotics is very common. To shake hands before the surgery, it is necessary to remove the canals that can be lit and turned off without touching, chlorohexidine or iodium, a sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile tools to cleanse under nails.
All jewelry has to be released.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
An old cleaning time (10 minutes) is not required.
When washing, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After we have finished washing our hands, our hands are dryed with a sterile cloth and a scalpel.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand care before and after dealing with the sick.
For the control of staphyloccus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from 20% first washing, and that the additional benefit obtained is very little when the frequency of hand cleansing is increased above 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three times the spread of infectious diseases to food than the washing of anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcoholic-based handshrinkers to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and difficult Clostridium spores from hands. Intervention to improve the cleanliness of the hands in health care can involve education for staff about hand-washing, increase availability of alcohol-based handshrinkers, and written reminders and sheets to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care services.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or washing facilities in residents’ homes, schools, and workplaces points to universal washing behavior as a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing dishes near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although options are available to create a cheaply washed area.
In any case, a low level of handwashing may also occur because of a habit that has been planted and not because of a lack of soap or water.
The desire and encouragement to wash hands with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and bring about changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
In order to walk effectively, surveillance and evaluation is required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that effective community-based approaches to increasing hand-washing at LMIC, while the social marketing campaign was not effective. One example of school-based washing was UNICEF's "Third Star Approach" that encouraged schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students washed their hands with soap, among other conditions of cleanliness.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a toilet can be a part of a washing machine that is done to reduce the sickness and death of a child.
The Day Washing the World's Hands is another example of awareness-raising campaign trying to achieve the goal of changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 Korean virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand-washed emoji.
Some studies investigate the cost-effectiveness of washing hands worldwide in countries developed in connection with the avoidance of disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the missing year size of illness.
One survey showed that encouraging soap-washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as a mother who had just given birth or an injured soldier in a hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two hand-sanitary lollards: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care workers" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection was caused by the foul smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, a plague transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the U.S. Centers of Control and Prevention of Diseases More active stimulates hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 pig flu epidemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic will increase awareness in many countries will be of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the contagious disease.
For example, posters "technically washes the right hand" were hung next to the sink washing hands in the public toilet as well as in the bathroom of the office and airport in Germany.
The expression "washing hands from" means declaring someone's reluctance to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
The statement comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to make Jesus Christ, but it has been widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continuously to cleanse the imaginary stains; acts that indicated her guilt for the crime she did and had induced her husband to do so.
It has also been known that after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the equipment to wash their hands.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation have a smaller degree of purity involved in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanness and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í trust, Hindus, has lived and are neutral in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also commands the washing of hands for cleanliness, especially after certain action.
Hindu religion, Jews, and Islam must wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindu religion, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam also required washing their hands before and after eating.
Hazard control for COVID-19
Occupational hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of safety and occupational health methodologies for the control of hazards for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk control at the workplace depends on the location of work and work, based on the risk assessment of exposure, the level of disease in society, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, work at low risk has minimal contact with the public and other work partners; for this work, it is encouraged basic infection prevention steps, which include washing hands, pushing workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and disinfection of the work environment routinely.
Occupations at risk include jobs that require close contact or often with people who are not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by the spread of ongoing society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with public communities, such as at school, the working environment with high population densities, and high volume rites.
Risk control for this group, in addition to the basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high efficiency airflows, protection against sine, and providing self-protection tools when confronted with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health and morgue that is spread to people who are known or expected to suffer from high exposure COVID-19, which increases the risk of exposure if workers do aerosol production procedures on, or take or cope with the specimens of, people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for this worker includes technical control, such as negative pressure ventilation room, and self-protection equipment appropriate to the job assignment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in the kind of things that are asked or in the way of getting these things (like shopping outside busy hours, through delivery, or heights).
Finally, shipments of items from the highly affected geographical area COVID-19 can be disrupted. Thepsychiatry and plan to perform infection disease may be used to guide the protective action.
The articles consider the risks associated with various workplaces and work, including the source of marketing, the risk posed by the household and society, and the risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also outlines the necessary controls to overcome the risk and emergency plans for situations that might result from the plague.
Psychopathy and the plan for the removal of contagious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objective of the outbreak is to reduce traffic between the staff, protect those at higher risk for poor health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize the effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The level of disease in the community where business is affecting the action taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is often used in safety and health work to block danger control by its effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last protective device.
Technical controls include insulating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the behavior of the workers and can be the most costly solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in policies or procedures that require the action of a worker or a worker.
Self-protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent part of the parentage.
All types of ODA should be selected according to danger to the workers, properly installed as they occur (e.g., breathing), consistently and correctly worn, checked, treated, and replaced on a time basis, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, work at low risk has minimal contact with the public and other employees.
Steps to prevent basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces, including the proper washing of hands, encourage workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics includes covering coughs and sinews, providing tissue and trash, preparing work from distant or round work at a time of arrival/time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and doing cleaning and disinfecting the work environment on a regular basis.
Fast identification and isolation of potential individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using other fever or other symptoms, and so that the policy of flexible sick leave allows employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees know about this policy.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk include jobs that require close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the spread of society around the business location, or because someone has recently made an international trip to the location with the extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes the workers who have contact with public communities such as at school, the working environment with the population of high population, and the high volume structure setting. Technical controls for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-risk groups of the air filters of high efficiency efficiency, increasing the level of ventilation levels, setting physical barriers such as plastic physical barriers to keep watchers in high populations, and setting up a high volume layout structure. Technical controls for this group and high-risk groups include installing high risk groups including installing high-risk air filters of high efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, increasing levels of ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as plastics such physical barriers to keep guard-sin-sin-sin-sin, and setting windows to drive-thru drive-thrunt drive-through windows to the location of this group and high-risk groups of high-risk groups include the forum group group groups, increasing the high-risk air filters of high-efficiency air filters, increasing levels of ventilation points such as school levels, physical appeal levels, physical appeal levels of service lines and manner of manner of service, manner of manner of use of manner, manner and manner of ease, manner of use of use of dress and manner, manner, means of dress and manner, manner of use, means of use, means of dress and manner, manner, means of use, means of use, means of use, means of use, means of use, means of dress and manner, means of use, means of use, manner, manner, manner, manner, manner, manner, manner, manner, means, and manner, means of use, means of use, and skill, means of use, and manner, manner, manner, means, means of use, means, means of use, and manner, and manner, means, means, means, means, and , means, means, means, means, means, means, means, and , means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, etc, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means, means of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , means of, means, means, means of, means, means, means, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, and , and , means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , means of, and , and , and , and , and , means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and manner of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , means of, means of, and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and manner of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and manner of, and manner of, and manner of, means of, means of, and manner of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, means of, and , and , and manner of, means, means of, means of, means of, means of, and manner of, means of, means, means, while, while, means, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and ., means of, means of, means of, means of, and manner of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, means of, and , and , and , and , and , and , and , means of, and
Workers in this risk group don't often need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating those who are sick from others by 6 feet, showing one of your cabins to take care of the sick, and offering a mask to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or blushing.
You cabins should wear medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or touching body fluid or potentially contaminated surface and possibly another protective device if a sick passenger suffers from fever, ongoing cough, or breathing difficulties.
The handkerchiefs and other items shall be disposed of in a bag of life-threatening hazards, and the surface that is contaminated shall be cleaned and disinfected after that; and for commercial voyages, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the control of the danger shall cover the journey if it is ill, isolates itself, and informs the medical center on the ship immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms when it is on board.
Ideally, further medical action is done in the cabins of people isolated. Apart from the public distribution, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in society at a minimum level up to now, a social reduction strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, voice unions, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between desks, arrivals and standard departures, limiting non-essential visits, and using separate health facilities for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high spread in local society, in addition to a social rehabilitation strategy, the extension of the school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the risk of direct health risks is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to contact the person confirmed or expected COVID-19 recommended to follow the same guidance as the emergency medical technician, including the use of appropriate protection devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect the belts and the work equipment before being used by using a household spray or lip cleaning procedure and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of old ODA and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA believes that certain bodies and bodies are at a high - risk or high - ranking risk.
High-risk work includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation equipment that are exposed to known patients or suspected COVID-19.
This job becomes a risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol production procedures on, or take or handle the specimens of, known or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, coughing induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some procedures and dental checks, or invasive specimen removals.
High risk morgue work includes workers involved in preparing the body of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at death; this job becomes a risk of high exposure if the worker performs autopsy. Additional technical controls for this group of risks include isolation rooms for known patients or suspected COVID-19, including when the aerosol success procedure is performed.
Ventilation special negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care arrangements and mortgage rooms.
Specimen must be dealt with with with a Level Level of Biosafety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who have come to be separated into a different waiting room based on whether they are expected to be in the COVID-19 case. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends a respirator for those who work within 6 feet of a known patient or are suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the person who performs aerosol success procedure.
In the United States, the N95-approved or better NIOSH-approved facial capacitor should be used in written and comprehensive breathing protection program contexts that include compliance tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respirator can provide greater protection and increase the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend clothing covered entirely or covered by COVID-19 is a breathing disease and not transmitted through body fluid.
WHO only recommended surgical masks for scrining officers at the entrance point.
For a person who takes breathing specimens, treats, or transports patients COVID-19 without aerosol revenue procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If the aerosol output procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that the ODA supply is not sufficient worldwide, WHO recommends that it minimize the need for ODA through a long-distance medical service, physical shielding like a peer-proof window, with only the person involved in the immediate treatment can enter the room with the patient VOVID-19, use only the required ODA for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without releasing it when treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and ordination of the ODA supply chain, and does not encourage the use of masks for people without symptoms.

BARRIS SUBJEK: [Cvid-19] Lighting the burden and preparing the future
PACKAGE LEAFLET: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a thing that makes it clear the global human connection and responsibility that we have to each other.
We've never had the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all our fellow workers by e-mails, calls, and talks are an incredible validation of the extraordinary human beings, which we are lucky enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud that I can call you my fellow worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to access Wikipedia and how it is a powerful symbol for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site keeps running, helps pay our partners, or helps maintain our community security.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustment to our work schedule and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was a proper response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the survival of the organization throughout this time.
We really want to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract employees:
Our daily work expectancy is approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notification is made.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
But the world cannot be predicted at this time, and whether you need to care for loved ones, spend on basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been necessary, but we're saying it.
Cutting sick or PTOs is not necessary, just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to make sure the main work areas can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed with positive COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Companions whose hour-based wages will be paid full.
We've said it, and say it once again, to respect our commitment to the contractor's partner and the clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
It's included if you're sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use jobs as a way of stressing the world around us.
Our work can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and Dana Collection Team, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to evaluate the current purpose and divert our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down now will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "working late after hours" after this pandemic passes.
You wouldn't be expected to work late to meet the unrealistic deadlines right now.
We realize that the situation has changed and will try to set a new target and line if necessary.
What about the APP?
In order to adjust to the new reality and the day - to - day worktime, we intended to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Yearbook.
We mean to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can prioritize important work, care, and care for loved ones while adapting their needs or wanting to work on a schedule less for the next few weeks.
The length of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We'll make our proposal to the Council next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, layout, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of deep concern, we hired anti-virus cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco’s office.
They're using hospital-based antivirus to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building applied its own safety control protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We're happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members based on DC.
Starting last week, our D.C. office has moved to a long, long-distance service, with a guide that was shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in NYC know, we are also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work long distances for the first time.
Our longtime fellow worker realized that it might require adjustments and they want to give you advice:
We'll have to keep a meeting for the longest time of one or two hours.
If the longer session is required, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Define meetings clearly, on the agenda, and send previous publications.
Make video as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Lead the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a record of meetings (or make a collaborative record).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to fellows about the work they share
The SDM Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics to support the increase of distributed work throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the recipients of the community funding to cancel the public event that was funded by the Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic ended.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restraints could make them unable to complete the approved reverse activity and that no one would be given a pin because they had to postpone or modify the target.
This next week we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and the regional community conference and other issues.
In general, feelings from all over the global community seem to be a sadness over this disorder, but at the same time relief from clarity and the ability to focus on one’s own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare a page at Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the effects and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT to a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also seek to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are now significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the course of the main work, or trouble with the bills, or anything else that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be a liaison to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send email to Bryan Juda, Director of Global Operation International SDM.
None of these changes are seen as our work load and our obligation.
On the contrary, this change is a recognition that, at this time, our work and duties may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are the steps that we believe are important in supporting each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need our movement, and give the service world that they rely on.
The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work as well as you do when you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other leadership team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and gut.
ACE2 has anti-angiotensin (ACE) anti-angiotensin (ACE) enzyme activity, reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is metaloenzym containing sengs located on the surface of endothel cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein has M2 domain peptidase terminal-N and domain transporter asam renal protein collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I bypass membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain found on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extrasel domain ACE2 is separated from the transmegral domain by another enzyme, known as shiddase, and the chained protein produced released into the blood stream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane especially type II alveolar lung cell, enteritis small intestines, endothel arteries and veins, and pulmonary muscle cells in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The ACE2 main function is as an ACE controller.
ACE breaks angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut asbestos amino phenylalanine terminal carbossil from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis became angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, lungin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges the traffic of membrane transporters of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 functions as a primary entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (sarrival causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (sarrival causing COVID-19).
More specifically, attaching S1 protein to the spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 caps with the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface causes endo sitosis and the transfer of viruses and enzymes into the endosomals located in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the primary protein S by a series of proteases of the TMPRSS2, which are currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that the decrease of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continued treatment of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB.
A systematic and meta-analysis survey published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors caused a 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia on patients with higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 human combination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplysaccharide.
Half-time rhACE2 in humans about 10 hours with working time 30 minutes apart from the 24-hour (duration) effect.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance against classical renin-angiotensin (RAS inhibitor) inhibitors or in an angiotensin II disease in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b' APPLICATION COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to overcome the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying the "contaque" that may have made contact with the infected.
Many applications were developed or proposed, which received official support from the government in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks for building contacts tracking applications have been developed.
The problem of privacy is questioned, especially related to the system based on tracking the geographic location of the application user.
Alternatives that do not absorb privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed applications that allow citizens to check whether they have been in contact with the COVID-19 patient.
This application is used in more than 200 cities in China, in Singapore, using an application called TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia launches "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the pattern of people who are potentially infected and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the application is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking of contacts was in the stage of further development and would be available for distribution within weeks. Similar applications were planned in Ireland and France ("StopCvid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means introducing geofencing applications for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on an application-based system, which includes false positive and possibly less effectiveness if the data taken is limited to a small part of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of a misleading or dangerous coronavirus application, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add related coronavirus applications to the App Store, which means limiting only for a "remist" organization or a reputation.
Google and Amazon apply a similar limitation.
Private supporters express their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance using a coronavirus application, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure that is made to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after a threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations make statements that draw limits on such surveillance.
This organization states eight terms on the government project:
surveillance must be "according to law, necessary, and proportional";
surveillance and surveillance must have a sunset;
data usage must be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with the third party must be defined in the laws;
There must be protection against misuse and the right of citizens to respond to misuse;
participation means all of my "relevant interests" required, which includes community health experts and listed groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) German and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple article means to deal with ongoing surveillance problems by removing tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based tracking, rather than applications, so that they remove the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel a networked tracking was approved.
A network-based solution that has access to raw location data has a potential significant privacy problem.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protected systems have been created and use the central server only for intercom (see below).
In South Korea, an application-free system used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes cellular device tracking and card transaction data, and merges this information to produce notification through text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the general public, which is permitted by extensive changes in the privacy laws of information after it has been seized by MERS in the country.
This information is available to the general public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a system-based system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
The tracking of privacy-protected contacts is a well-founded concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to another phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes a centralised and decentralised approach, and not a single protocol. The decentralised protocol includes a Decentralised Approach to Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called the Contact Event Number, CEN), a Protocol and a Sensitive Private Search Mechanism (PCT), and other.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use a technique that protects privacy when collecting and using the location or data of the random intersection to track the COVID-19 distribution.
This was based on a study of the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort was the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive health locations and data with other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups with a basically same approach and is a much-expanded protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key feature in reaching broad acceptances.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that they had made BlueTrace protocols used by its official government application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for tracking contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy encryption.
They also established the basic technology specifications that are used in that system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launch of a tool to allow the government to create an official tracking application that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly to the iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address data collection and monitoring problems continues at first distributing the system through the updating of the operating system, and then deleting it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Repositioning medication (also called a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task on medication or therapy) is the intended use of medicine for new treatment purposes, i.e. for a different medical condition or disease with the initial purpose of drug development.
This path is a scientific research path that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Another research direction includes development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several sites of ligan binding.
Analysis of such linkage sites can be the basis for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papa-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphase.
Hussein A A, et al studied some of the candidates that were then optimized and analyzed the size of the skeleton with the drug that had been approved and had the highest taste to speed up the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug potential in its clinical study to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune disease.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin were two of the four drugs to be examined as part of the Solidaritas clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that a chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin test in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokuin sulphate and phosphate chlorokuin based on the U.S.
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial and U.S. authorisation only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are being treated slowly, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychlorokuin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not set yet.
Doctors say they use that medicine when there's no other choice.
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is doing a small study of the use of chlorokin combined with sing, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
High school is being held at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and integrity test of hydroxychlorokuin prevention.
Tiokok's clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipyravir proved to be "effectively correct."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days on 45 patients who did not receive the medication.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipyravir and half received humifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Corps remind the public that evidence exists to support the drug little and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for supplies and use the military to send it to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat the patients with CVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to Trump's government on the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in case of a severe virus that has been replicated.
This medicine may not be safe if you use a pregnant mother or someone who tries to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "there is no known benefit".
This medicine is designed to slow down the replication of HIV by binding proteases.
A research team at the University of Colorado is attempting to modify the drugs to find a substance that would be related to SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in scientific society about resource allocations to reposition drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO inserts lopinavir/ritonavir into international Solidarity Trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against some of the philosophers, pneumo-, paramigo-, and corronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance through mutations that can cause more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some early trials show that remdesivir may have a high genetic strain on resistance. There are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials performed by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for the sick and one for the sick.
There are three clinical trials being carried out for intravenous vitamin C for those who are treated with incapacitated and severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled plasebos (Tiokkok, Canada) and one without control.
New York State began testing for azitromysin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The National Health and Global Medicine Center (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, corticosteroid inhalation for asthma, for the treatment of the new presymtomatic coronovirus infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 reversing enzyme, Phase II tests are being conducted with 200 patients will be recruited from a very poor case in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers from Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of collkisin in reducing inflammation and complications of the lungs of patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, given the name COLCORONA, recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older diagnosed with COPID-19 and has mild symptoms so that they do not need inhalation.
Women who are pregnant or who do not breastfeed or use effective contraception methods do not meet the requirements.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low - molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients by motivating the Italian Medicines to publish their instructions on their use.
A multi-centered study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at a prophylaxis and therapeutic dose announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving the purpose of new treatment to approved antivirus drugs and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the second edition of the Chinese edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tiokok version of the 7th edition
Some antibiotics identified potentially as a drug may be a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by Tiokok.
In addition, tests are also performed in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed the clinical trial, there is much effort being made to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the tiusatif virus of this disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, which resulted in investment and extensive research to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that what needs to be noted in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution on a required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target that is advanced to phase I security study, includes:
nucleat acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I control and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I control and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (considered as being in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II tests the initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed at random, controlled placebo, and at some locations, determining the most appropriate effective dose.
Phase III trial usually involves more participants, including the control group, and tests vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in human assessment (also in "praclinis").
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular seal vaccine that would genetically modify the virus protein to stimulate immune reactions.

On March 10, 2020, the Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and production of vaccines.
In addition, this partnership includes a preclinical and clinical trial plan Phase I in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Department announced that they were working 11 isolates, and even on a fast track, development of the vaccine took at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported developing particles similar to corronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with tests on humans planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that President of the United States, Donald Trump, had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, to CureVac, which the German government had protested.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with a German company, BioNTech, to develop a mRNA-based vaccine together.
Currently, mRNA-based vaccine candidates, BNT162, are in a preclinical trial with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotectic company Tax Biotech announced that they would receive the results of the preclinical testing in April 2020 and the vaccine candidates at the final stage could begin to test humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Innovation Coalition of Epidemi Psychiatry (CEPI) announced a total investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Another ECI investment team for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccines that could amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving a follow-up from Tiokkok.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a funding of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against VOCID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced funding of C$192 million special to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to set up a national vaccine bank with some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported PittCoVacc's examination, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in rats; they stated that "MNA that gave S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines produces a specific antigen anti-bodies response that can be started on rats two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, Professor of Pharmacy Waterloo University announced a DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce particles similar to harmless viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
By March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit beyond the disease that prevents them.
Australia's more top-up tests are trying to get 4,170 medical officers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the safety of vaccines uses specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-manufacturers, shows the need for steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in handling life viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on a non-human animal model.
By 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, the confirmed SARS research can be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatment for MERS-CoV infections.
By March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed phase I clinical trial in humans, and three other vaccines in the process, all of which were virus-vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVA), and one MVA-MERS-S.
Social media posts support conspiracy theory claiming the virus behind the COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine is available.
The patents quoted by various social media posts refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronaviruses, such as corronavirus SARS.
b'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by cronavirus heavy breathing 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common disorders include fever, cough, and breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of the sense of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from exposure to thunderstorms is generally about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and failure to perform drugs.
By April 17, 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. This virus mainly spreads interhumanism when there is close contact, often through sparks or small drops produced through coughs, sneezing, or while talking.
Despite being produced as a breather, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface rather than contaminating to a distant distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. Standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the actual-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on the nasofaring usp.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and the one who treats it.
Recommendation on the use of masks by different public; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend the use, and others enforce the use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all six countries in the WHO region.
People who are infected with viruses can experience symptoms without symptoms or symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include trouble breathing, pain or ash in the chest that continues, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips; medical withdrawal is advised immediately if these symptoms appear.
Upper breathing symptoms, such as sweating, insulating, or sore throat, can be found, but it rarely occurs.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in a wide range of percentages.
Some of the cases in the beginning in China were only with the description of the chest and the palpitation of the clinic.
To some, disease can develop into pneumonia, a failure of the ants, and death.
This time is called an incubation time.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are sprawling will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection. Report shows that not everyone who is infected has symptoms.
The role of this bearer without symptoms in transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence indicates that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of people infected that do not show symptoms that are unknown and are being investigated, with the Korean Center for Control and Disease Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all cases confirmed remained without symptoms during hospital treatment.
The Tiokok National Health Commission began to report cases without symptoms in the daily case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and clay water can carry a virus charge on a large scale.
Speaking out with more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through air, the United States National Science Academy has shown that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air carriers placed in the hallways outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can make the breathing gap change into aerosol and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through a phase, this risk is believed to be low.
The Center for European Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/carduine, up to three days on plastic (polypropyl) and solid steel (ISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly; soap products break down the fat layer of the virus protector, deactivate the virus, and free it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other streams, such as chlorida benzalkonium and glukonat chlorhexidine (surgery disinfection), are not effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day test.
Koronavirus heavy akat breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new akat heavy breathing syndrome, the first time isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the classer case acute breathing disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features on the corronavirus that's related to nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by a household soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses anang through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzymes, the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
This virus uses glycoprotein of a special surface called "spike or capillary" to connect to ACE2 and enter an angel cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of the infected people who were treated poorly in Wuhan, Tiokok, and more often in severe disease.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms are due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute miokard injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
The thrombosis (31%) and high vena thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients of COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with bad prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for the respiratory tract epitel expressing ACE2, patients with heavy COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, T-cells that secrete GM-CSF pathogens have proven to be interlinked with monosite recordings that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphostic infiltration was also reported on autopsy.
WHO has established some testing protocols for this disease.
Standard testing method is the reaction of the polymerase string real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on the breathing sample obtained by using the nasopharynx; however, the nasal orputum sample can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two samples taken within two weeks so that the result has a small time value.
The Chinese scientist is able to isolate this coronavirus and regulate its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain (PCR) reaction testing to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously infected) are in development, but not widely used.
The experience of the Tiokkok test showed the accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States agreed to the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostics issued by the Hospital Zhongnan University of Whah suggest a method of detecting infections based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Cross-bilateral ground-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetrics, and posteriorly found much at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crayading (lobular septum balance with varying alveolar filling), and consolidation can appear as disease develops.
A little data is available on microscopic and pathophysiological studies COVID-19.
The primary pathological finding on autopsy is:
Makroscopy: pleurisis, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of disease virus pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumosite hyperplasia, large-pitched pneumosis, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the establishment of giant cells with many subjects
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar output.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the healing phase: high levels of alveolar and interstitial fibrosis lunger
Blood: intravascular coagulation is recommended (DIC); leukoerethroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing your mouth and nose with the tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the part in the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Appropriate hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from cloths in the public domain, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The strategy is intended to reduce contact with people infected with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in the public.
Limitations also include keeping at least six feet or eight feet [1.8 m] away.
There is no known effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Because the vaccine is not yet anticipated until early 2021, the main part in treating COVID-19 is trying to reduce the top of the epidemic, which is known as "curves".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty before eating, as well as after thickening their noses, coughing, or sweating.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand-services that contain at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-services are not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glyserol added as wettan.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect them carry a virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) oxygenation has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but its benefits are still considered.
Self - cleaning and lifestyle and eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms at the early stages of infection. WHO and the Tiokok National Health Commission have published recommendations for treating the NIVID-19 sufferer.
Intensive care professionals and dental experts in the U.S. have developed recommendations for treatment from various agencies to be free of charge, i.e. IBM.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some of the medical personnel recommend paraetamol (astaminofen) compared to ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary action should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care arrangements when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health services that treat patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the U.S. Cell Infection Space (IIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and child restraint. CDC provides guidance for the use of self-restraint devices (APDs) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD cover, breathing or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not face mask) is better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on the U.S.
The N95 respirator is designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for the unspecified use of the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection or, as a last effort, artificial masks themselves.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until it requires mechanical or alternative ventilation, but most of the cases are heavy.
Type of breathing support for a person who has failed to breathe linked to COVID-19 is currently being tested for a person who is being cared for, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal canal or bipositive airway pressure.
It's not known if one of these two methods results in the same benefits for those who are critically ill.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canals. The more heavy cases occur in the elderly (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many advanced countries do not have enough captain hospital beds, which limit the health system's capacity to handle the surge suddenly number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require an innate rate.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were treated in a stateless state eventually entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) occurs on the COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilator capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothoracs.
High PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
Research on potential treatment begins in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug development may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or are in further testing.
Antivirus drugs can test people with severe diseases.
Volunteers who recommend WHO are also involved in tests of potential efficacy and safety of treatment.
Plasma convalesen has not yet been given the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the disease.
In February 2020, Tiokok launched a mobile application to deal with the disease.
User is asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'near contacles' using surveillance data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends quarantine alone, but also informs local health officers. Analysts data on mobile data, facial recognition technology, tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track the infected and those who compete with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
By March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security agency to track the phone records of those suspected of being coronaryly infected.
That step was taken to treat quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government body Robert Koch Institute, in search of and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera, said he was told that mobile operator that "40% of citizens still move places".
The German government did the hackathon last 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
Moreover, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to counter coronavirus circulation.
People may be pressured by quarantine, bordering travel, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection themselves.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn is a perfect storm that threatens mental health and the well-being of the community."
This disease can continue mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other general respiratory diseases, such as pile.
Small cases usually heal in two weeks, while those who suffer from severe illness or crisis may need to take three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for heavy COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less likely. For some people, COPID-19 can affect lungs so it causes pneumonia.
In the worst affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into an acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of an organ.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood flow, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clotting disorders, especially an increase in prothrombin time, are observed in 6% of patients treated as inhaled COVID-19, while kidney function disorders are seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 picture show an increase in heart enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the storm and death is ten days, with five days spent in the inhalation.
However, the patients transferred to the ICU had a median period of seven days between the rate of inhalation and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in Tiokok, men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathology testing postmortem lung sample shows diffuse alveolar damage with the content of cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus were observed in pneumositis.
A lung image resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Tiokok National Health Commission, heart damage is observed, with an increase in troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of the people who are cared for have poor conditions. The availability of medical and social resources in an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from different conditions due to differences in the area, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Fewer calculations of a minor case can cause the death rate to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean the number of deaths currently being counted too low.
Perocok has the possibility of 1.4 times more severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers. There is concern about what the range of these diseases is.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% fall in lung capacity in some who recovered from the disease, and lung screening showed organ damage.
It can also cause some anxiety-intensive disease after recovery.
By March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections give effective and long-term immunity to people who recover from this disease.
Immunities may be gained, if you look at another coronavirus behavior, but have been reported that there is a case of cure COVID-19 followed by a positive corronavirus test a few days later.
The case is believed to be a bad remaining infection, and not a re-infection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and animal-based, by spreading infections.
As well as not actually known, but by December 2019, the spread of infection almost entirely was driven by the spread of human beings to humans.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, first published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the earliest warning date was December 1, 2019.
Official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and by time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of health care systems, management options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, type of sex, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established ICD-10 emergency U07.1 for death from the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory and U07.2 for death from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without confirmation of laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Death ratio in case reflects the number of deaths in the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate for the case in general is 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) by April 17, 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Another measurement includes the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities in the infection (IFR), which reflect the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and undiagnosed) who die from certain diseases.
This statistic is timeless and following a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people create antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
At the outbreak of the plague in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively minor mortality, and probably not all of the COVID-19 deaths classified as the COVID-19 death.
Further, the German health system has not yet suffered a great deal.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The pandemic and mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a different risk between new men and women does not appear at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reasons for this type of sex certainly are unknown, but the genetic and behavioral factors may be excuses.
Immunological differences based on the type of sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are men and 72% are men who died because of COVID-19.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track data related to the sex type for COVID-19 infection.
Research indicates that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers with a higher gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhamom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the abbreviation for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first outbreak identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as Tiokok), animal species, or a group of people, along with international recommendations for an attempt to prevent stigmatization. Virus that causes COVID-19 to be named coronavirus heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communication.
Both disease and the daily virus are referred to as coronavirus.
At the beginning of the Whah, Tiokok, the virus and the disease are called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and akat 2019-nCov respiratory disease as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidance that required not to use the location name in the name of the disease and the virus.
Official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal evaporation and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in great need of ventilator valves, and a vendor could not provide within the required timescale, a local company would blow up and print 100 valves in the last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 disease, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and disinformation arose about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to several other animals.
Study failed to find evidence of replication of the virus on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no drug or vaccine approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COPID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization used SOLIDARITY Trial to study the effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds of honesty.
The vaccine is not available yet, but various institutions are active in developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were used together using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, the researcher intends to make a full vaccine virus.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, is intended to rapidly trigger a human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, is designed to create vaccines that make immune systems sensitive to specific subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps virus infect the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA, a new technique for making vaccination).
The experimental vaccine designed with these strategies must be tested to find out the safety and accuracy of these strategies. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from a virus that causes disease. An increase in the antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for developing the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials ongoing in April 2020.
Seven tests try to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies against hydroxychlorokuin or chlorokuin.
The newly targeted antivirus drug formed most of the Tiokok research, with nine Phase III tests on redesivir in some countries with speed of reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 has already existed.Some of the antiviral drugs currently being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which included remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir were combined with interferon beta.
By March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the honesty of rendesivir.
Increased clinical attention is paid to patients who have been treated with redesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy.
There is, however, a call for careful examination of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be turned off.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized emergency use for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policies of a doctor caring for the patients of the COPID-19.Tiokok's seventh edition also reported interferon, ribavirin, or humifenovir to be used against the COPID-19.
The baseline data shows that a ribavirin high dose is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksaniide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing low-concentration SARS-CoV-2 stimuli. Research shows that initial premonitions against toxin protein by transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) proteases are important for input SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin with or without azitromysin has great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a role known in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur at COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have an antisitokin trait. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment procedure by the T.T. National Health Commission after a small investigation.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm, this drug is meant to fight a cytokine storm, which is supposed to be the cause of death on some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of cytokine rerefracter steroids induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there has not been any random and controlled evidence showing that tocilizumab is an appropriate treatment for CRS.
Transfers the refined and sharpened antibodies produced by the human system that has been cured from the COVID-19 to those who need it are being examined as a non-vaccin passive immunization method.
This strategy is tested for SARS with incomplete results.
Neutralization of the virus is a working mechanism that is expected for passive antibodies therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cell cytotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may as well.
Another passive antibodies form, for example, using the produced monochlonal antibodies, is in development.
Convalescent serum production, which is part of the fluid of cured patients' blood and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of severe associated syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died because of COVID-19 after spreading awareness of the virus.
