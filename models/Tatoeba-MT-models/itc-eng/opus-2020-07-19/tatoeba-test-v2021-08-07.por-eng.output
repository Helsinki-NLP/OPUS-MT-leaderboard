White: tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawns in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which the blacks will only have two options: take the tower in a6 or play their bishop to any other house of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and give it mate. In the second situation, the white tower takes the pawn in black of a7, with identical result.
