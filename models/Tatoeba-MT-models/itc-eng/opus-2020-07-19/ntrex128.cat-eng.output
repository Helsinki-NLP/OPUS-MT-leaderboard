Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy stemmed from the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remindered with Twp or Pwp."
Not Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party Assembly commented that the set of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
On the other hand, a Welsh Conservative member claimed that his group was "open" before the name change, but he also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Moppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal deletion to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall within the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gives the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, even though the committee was decanted by "Gallish Parliament Members" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was given greater support to the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives; however, the attempt to reach consensus may lead to a complete misunderstandings for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on their country's name change
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The popular consultation was decided on an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are no longer ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of them."
According to Adam, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money they get from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict, "and sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from."
The churches, it adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he says, "so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white congregation there departed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to his church in St. Martin's, described the rosary as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who sounded the rostrum in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the world's first trolley that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest cart of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What did sound in St. Martin's in the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July, expressing its concern that the diocese "wanted to transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in contracting the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy looking for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was spending about half an hour knocking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he shouted 'M' they bit!
I've been bitten!'
He had the whole snug clavicle," Hammel watched as he got to the boy.
"Because everyone comes out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'," adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to serious condition.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that a few weeks' work had been detected in the area, but that was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them don't consider themselves dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, to the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with pasta-style beauty products of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and produce sectors of the home stay behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores the next year if the test becomes successful.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that he will double his offer of beauty to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with areas of brand-like areas that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also being launched from its range of Boutique make-up products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demand for younger consumers.
The minority chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's, the first one did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching into a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day to small supermarkets has made large supermarkets need to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, the stores are becoming more and more like large stores in an attempt at the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos sales outlets to many of his supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch the sales of cavities and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to release its departments of beauty products and pharmacy turned out to be a failure.
Sainsbury did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but everything ended up hastily not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of his 281 pharmacy business in Celesio, owner of LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury leather brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, salesman of Sainsbury's, says, "We've transformed the look of our beauty products corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We've invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and to challenge the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones "dangerous" after Holly Willoughby is back on a deal of GBP 11 million.
The Star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones left "dangerous" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby turned behind a deal of GBP 11 million with Jones's life-style branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the joint home product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Plaintow.
This Morning's 37 - year - old introduced Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Star Dragons' Den Peter Jones angry by withdrawing in the last minute of his lucrative life-style business to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "dangerous" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his central empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which the new agreements of the presenter, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Plaintow and aspired to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his march from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where we would see him for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to step back left without words all the parts involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods at its center in Marlow ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothes for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined him as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the share in the Baldwin television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand embassies and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity ITV program host.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We will not comment on their business."
Bad accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms from the media to make a comment that some would consider "little of a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking a news presenter's tone of voice:
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are stagnated.
More than three months after the summit held in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented this on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response in correspondence" by the US at the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
And now we're keeping this big relationship."
According to Trump, their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: end of testing with missiles, help to free hostages and return home to remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this corner full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was told to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, which was required to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to the provision of help.
Given the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although Aceh has built shelters in the case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that he contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to pay attention to the victims of the earthquake is now heading toward Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and he has invested enormous amounts of money in rail and rail roads.
However, Joko's government is facing the coming year of the re-election loaded with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displacements are the result of the fighting that takes place on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with bricks, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool is a four-point goal with a far-off shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at the 89th Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before he let go an incredible shot directed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled to the right cross of the gate.
The pilot finally began the descent above a fully-fledged Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was only trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté come, I made a knock, and I didn't think much, I just committed to kick."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the break after scoreing a goal to minute 25 via her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team went back a pass to Mateo Kovacic before he got off from nearly the middle of the field and sprinted into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Then he made a magnificent thorough pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard passed the defense to finish the second pole with a match with the left leg where the holder of the Liverpool Alisson Becker couldn't get there.
Liverpool will face Naples at the champions' league group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 in St. Paul's Stadio in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings collapsed because of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a woman stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several belongings on Grayson Mews, John Street; then, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the people in the area who have seen or heard something about the crime before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statements: "Although the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead that I had seen or heard anything suspicious, that please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car's on-board camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead's body and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have stated that they are reporting facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When she knew what had happened, she ran out of words.
He's warning the residents that hours will pass until they can get back in.
It was felt like a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as the crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
Don't stop saying "It's terrible!"
By 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the area agreed with another truck parked outside.
A number of Roman agents inside the agreed area controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who can have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously by 0800 555 111 and mention 247 on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite history"
Its disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban's purest style of many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "boxy" and a "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing Cromwell incorrectly for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in front of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a completely accurate representation is a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century mid-conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A murdering pig is killing a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a court of pigs at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cattle into pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as it is known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a court of contiguous pigs.
According to the court, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg fence had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs crushed and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as noted in the news of Guiyang evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was locked and isolated to avoid anyone else attacking while the police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her Massachusetts farm, and left the man with severe wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilograms grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "decadent."
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all over the southwest of the United States
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she advances over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains all over northern Mexico and the South-West of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a hurricane in category 1, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, time in the east of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the direction to the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a tropical rainstorm heading north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave as many as 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains all over the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous streams, waste streams, and the possibility of land-slicing in the desert.
The tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the south-west, especially to much of Arizona.
There's a possibility that there will be laughter, since the situation is getting very much worse because of the scattered character of tropical rains.
It is totally forbidden to enter the desert on foot in the face of the tropical rain threat.
Stormy rains might cause the gorges to turn into uncontrolled rivers, and storms can bring wind and dust to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at determined points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that there are total precipitations above 50 mm, which could cause minor waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall in the rainy season in the region.
They'll start arriving in isolated tropical rainheads in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the corner region on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October there will be several significant fluctuations of temperature across the US as the Arctic cools down, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This can sometimes lead to drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The Central American region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Differences in temperature of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the lingering heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the Central and Eastern U.S. area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Planes to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures above average temperatures in the U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers saw the passionate witness of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, who allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political process continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a round of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford explained to the Senate committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other chains that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has problems with calculating the people he sees from his office.
Put in perspective, it's an audience similar to an American football game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the chain with more audience, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the one-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS reached 3.1 million, the NBC 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
Interest stays high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being rebuked by protesters when he was trying to get up to an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake spent several minutes with the fainting sight while she was on live TV on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in the sight of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already broadcasting live when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not it went ahead with Kavanaugh's appointment to fill the Senate in order to put it to the vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Cons and several senators, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice had an influence, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of disdaining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at conservative party convention in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former Foreign Affairs Minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU will reap each other's taxes is "all absurd".
Wayde Sims Murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player who was militating on the ULS team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to jail for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses at the crime scene and claimed that Simpson's DNA was found in them, according to CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to having Wayde killed a shot, according to the police.
His bail has been fixed at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The law firm in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, claiming that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the State of Louisiana police operating group, the state police criminalist lab, the Southern University police and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva expressed his appreciation to the local order forces for their "diligence and to seek justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
About nine feet [1.98 m], he played to go and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebots to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "broken down" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
An ashtray volcano in Mexico City
The ashtray hatched by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring various shocks and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images on social media where a fine layer of ash is appreciated in the windshields of cars in Mexico City like Xochimilco.
The geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence faced the riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by the riot police began throwing their eggs and paint into dust, causing the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, beatings were produced by the police, who used their pores to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live in Spain."
Fourteen people were subjected to mild injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
Tension has not decreased in this region of independent mentality one year after October 1 a referendum considered illegal for Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opponents of the secession boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, causing violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence protest along with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope about the possibilities Catalonia could offer to achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little, in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the empire this year, since many of their leading leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile, waiting to be tried for their role in the referendum organization and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, and said the conflict had been fueled by both sides' politicians.
"The tension is only increasing," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Present as a candidate in European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after wearing a house with a car
Three 33, 34, and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car repeatedly invests against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the same building.
It's also possible that at some point someone shot a bullet at the car.
A Menga game wins Livingston for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston was to win
Livingston, who this year had climbed into the category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the club in the neighborhood of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's game made the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team goes to second position, sharing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's people, on the other hand, still don't win out of the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they'll face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid in Europe League this Thursday.
The Livingston, meanwhile, widens up to six parties its rebound in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of his opportunities in front of visitors' direct game
Holt's team should've gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal was, because his direct game caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he wasted his opportunity when he found himself in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to lie down trying to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, who crossed the gate.
The locals were good enough to let Rangers get close to their area, as they knew that visitors could get into trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came.
The referee whistled a fault against the interests of the Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and end from the central part of the area.
Until that time, Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a Liam Kelly porter who had very little work during the game,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a fine stop.
For his part, Rangers' porter Allan McGregor paused with his feet on an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination game from Livingston.
The Rangers went to hang once and again in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two criminal charges were claimed, one for a supposed Halkett entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for hands, both were dismissed.
Livingston "fenomale": Analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending journey.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed from their return to the highest category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way the team galvanized from its arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging from Menga throughout the party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely didn't know how to keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcome the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is on the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Astride reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They had deteriorated because of such issues as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's EU input.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police provided security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when he hits a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and although paramedics took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a runaway case on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
Metro police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the nearest family members.
The street has been cut and diverted for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded in an Interlocution · Global Voices
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security penitentiary facility, according to the headquarters.
The events occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and still remains.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved.
Agents had to be treated for slight wounds in the face of facts.
According to a prison spokesperson: "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to resolve an incident in Long Martin prison, which still remains.
Six employees have had to be treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, we are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to hold the police accountable and may have to spend more time in jail."
At Long Lartin Prison there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be served in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-avalot agents acted in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which central staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (drought areas could be benefited)
It is not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen in the early part of the week that comes when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national weather service has already issued river alerts for Monday and Tuesdays to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and to arrive at Monday night with rains.
Phoenix National Weather Service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression on a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models in the national hurricane center provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where they would record up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas in the south-west desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the risk of rivers, the rain of the rose could become very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Despite the fact that rivers are a serious cause of concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, since the southwestern region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportsweather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have strength of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So, it's expected that you will touch ground in Mexico with tropical storm force the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of rivers.
According toweather.com, "they wait from 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at first hour on Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into Tuesday night.
"The biggest risk we're expecting from Rosa or what's left of him is very heavy precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and the Southwestern U.S. desert," according to the national hurricane center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous streams and waste streams in the deserts, in addition to landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found with handcuffs in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the Midsomer Norton Terrace Excelsior area, about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he found himself stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two, 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some sort of recording of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the meskinny and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote of the ruthless and outraged tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "stricken and angry" the Democratic Party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared in front of Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also declared in the eye in relation to his allegorical.
The president said on Saturday that day, "The American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable journey of service to the city," he commented to the multitude of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the rate of participation of Republican voters in the elections in the middle of the term.
"We're five weeks from some of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh appointment is expected to take place as late as Friday, according to the CNN, an assistant of the Republican party leaders.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast by nightfall, dragging many of them to death and tearing everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had flown across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed up from a tree fleeing the tsunami and survived, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency that appreciate the amount of shops and destroyed buildings, turned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographic characteristics, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were left out.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Domula, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information came" from Dongula, says Nugroho.
Over 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the officials said the waves came during the time of the warning.
In a recording of a amateur share on social media, you can feel like a man on the top floor of a building shouts desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts out at the edge of the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in the electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuaters continue to need desperately food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although workers from World Vision in Dongala were able to get safe and safe in the city of Palu, where the employees lay in canvas shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups did the sad task of starting relief work, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fund-raising, provision and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arrani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While he was in Palu the second night after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the disappeared people kept the hope that the miracle and their loved ones would be preserved from the painful account of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued caught in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliding players for the Asian Games, which concluded early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagei, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As a minor in the scope of the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, within hours of the fact that he circulated the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think this means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier to Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.

While doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
He's been in West, 41 years old, motegen with his name Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before it appears in the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation by "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Besides being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
JAY-Z, former collaborator of West, has used his nickname with or without a dash and in capital letters.
The President of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when there is little time for the country to complete the 50th anniversary of a cruel reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would no longer be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when student movements from left-wing students were taking root all over Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He has stated that the arrest and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and a professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures on the subject of IA, despite the fact that there is a general lack of formal strategy in IA in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become world number 1 in terms of innovation in AI in 2030.
"Duplicate the budget for research in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advancement in the AI field," said Lee.
"Duplicate funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. has to achieve its next major AI discovery," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IIA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that exceeded the U.S. player in Othello with the best ranking and later served as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee positively rated previous technological competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the work of the US in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors at AI," he added.
In July 2017, the China Council of State presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public bodies in the United States give money to researchers in North America, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China," said Lee.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Art Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial and academic collaborators, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced an investment of USD 2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the Natural Sciences Foundation is concerned, it currently spends more than 100 million USD per year on research at AI.
In the meantime, no measures have been applied for months in relation to the US legislation that I intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide if they change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's accession requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalists argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has doubted whether there will be at least 50% needed participation for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum paper is, "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU joining the agreement with Greece?"
The name-change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the realm of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have stated that it will undermine the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, in which 66% of registered persons voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of tents installed by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov explained.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that incorporation into NATO will be accompanied by investments more than needed in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Macedonian Telma TV station, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% stated that they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first time for the pro-Western government policy since it took over the May of last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero from Manchester City makes a goal after regathering the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory went by 2 to 0 in the match fought at Ethihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Now he scored a goal a minute 65 in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The silverhead received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left at a speed between three Brighton defenses, scraping with what took him through the playing field.
Later, Agüero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He skyrocketed a defense before he passed a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that found Sterling.
The English lead returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, that with the right leg beat the porter of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that got stuck inside the network on the right side.
"Agreo teasing in foot trouble," Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told the journalists.
‘We decided that he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky you scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the First League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the ball in depth in Brighton's field and
made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before he passed it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues leader finished the ball inside the network before he left for the background line.
The City faced Hoffenheim on Tuesday, part of the Champions League group phase, at 18:55, in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff struggle, there was not much reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out on the mountain of the launch on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League, have the chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a wildfire with victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they still seek their first division title.
“Even though we don’t play anything, at least we can go out and get to know the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer throw if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
The right-wing shuttle in Washington has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 striktic eliminations in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
That's one of the big ones, big ones, I don't introduce myself, but I really do introduce myself, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible group of Democrats happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, they see their pettyness, their ill-intended intent.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to "resist and obstruct."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he whispered, and he called the Democrats "enraged, petty, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, causing a strong public shout.
“ Do you remember their response?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a number of British MPs to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he showed up firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for discreting with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, they are ironically similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the wake of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long been forgotten the promise of 'generous and kinder' policies, if ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions do not tolerate the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the Party's direction.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since you colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a political vision seemed to expect me to turn 180o and take positions that would never have taken, either on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made so that my candidacy is not renewed, central policies are denounced, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues that each day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't stop.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is seeing the level of abuse normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of "untrustful" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is tightening up.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head low, not so express and "all would go well".
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time of studying, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as local advisor or as minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, actually, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or no political interest will prevent me, according to my opinion, from acting in favour of the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr snags lead the lead
Two last hour rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant game of Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of the ten, occupy the first position at the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed because of its defensive superiority and the fact that it was better able to take advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still stuck, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose said: "Congratulation for the Ayr, they have taken advantage of better times than we have."
Grant Anderson's essay at the minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, handed over for the Warriors party, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored a non-converted essay.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just to half, scored and converted a test to put the 17-5 mark in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted to Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Later, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which retreated to the bed, and the Ayr dam extended the distance again with a Stafford McDowall trial converted to Climus.
Then, the alternate Captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and again the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted test by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a plate in Climo without a pilot, from the sanctions alignment, MacPherson scored a counter-assay behind the penetrated spring of the Ayr.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again from the dam, after Kyle Rowe collected a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to Gregor Henry's third line to score the fifth test of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move to the hostel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphill, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the subject, although a source of The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan was planning to enter Glasgow's "flowering restoration" sector.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without coast, hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol for their nave covered with base in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are enthralled with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover him.”
Along Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as it is the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, wait for the result with a positive stance," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivarian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will be in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has many hopes deposited in Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that, in case it does, things would not change very much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chile and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final delegations were presented, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from seeing yourself favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has attracted any gesture of goodwill from Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries had not traded embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
The next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crusade.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claims his nation won't eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made at a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume nuclear diplomacy stagnant more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's nice to think that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a statement that puts an end to the Korean War could make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington refuses to accept the statement if Pyongyang doesn't make major disarmament movements earlier.
Both Kim and the president. American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the question of giving up an arsenal that the country considers as the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last range of big hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of hats or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to find any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the walk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been torn down by very unpractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's featured piece was an exaggerated bee hat, adorned with a broad wing, pen-shaped, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were decorated sandwiches, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The big-sized hats climb the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat, with a double-footed wing, which everyone has brought from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat so impractical that spread through social networks led another great creation to the walkway: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed with bathrobe that wore it.
The bag of rabies, in dark orange, adorned with rabies locks and finished with a white leather strap, was the highlight piece of the collection The SS19 River in Jacquemus on the Week of the Fashion of Paris.
Famous styleist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential to World Citizens · Global Voices
Independent Schools in Scotland maintain an academic excellence trajectory that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are striving to provide a top-level service to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language that understands, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received the post A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a superior A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% French students and 63% Spanish students also obtained an A.
This proves that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an assortment of choice, are kept in the same consideration as the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) assignments in the study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons why employers gave them the costs of covering the vacancies, 17% was attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more opportunities for potential work that require languages, these competitions are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like that.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double digit.
That's why investing in language teaching is important to today's children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland there is a diversity of schools in the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he'll always be able to choose between a number of languages in independent schools, who have staff specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future may look like.
In the global trading environment of today's era, it cannot be denied that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent School Council
LeBron will debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-time game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes he'll be playing.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers' official site.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six pre-time Lakers' games.
“I don’t need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Summit in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump's scheduled meetings for the next week, including visits to friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for your candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump seeks support for the next mid-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video transmission on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing initiated this week with the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the allegations of sexual abuse he faced, while the Senate's anticipated confirmation vote is still pending for a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans present themselves in the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are directed to “estimating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congrès control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading to a busy campaign season,” said a Trump speaker who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could congregate supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract coverage of Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team shows their ambition to keep the hopes of individual Sunday parties alive
After three unequal sessions, the ants Saturday afternoon were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendulum of dynamic is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive retreat," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is a little blowing in his favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is setting an example.
The celebratory crimes rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put a crucial putt to match the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the whore that got them to win the game in the 15th hole with a similar shout, the kind that indicates that he thinks the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to work hard and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes for printing.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable sensation of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bring four of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow and from public bullying, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is placed on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to go out.
On Sunday, though, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are very fascinating to see for the interactions between devices, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and the Saturday foursomes with a victory of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired two formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a difficult Tiger Woods and leave his record, so far, four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, mastered by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a somewhat uncertain American team at the fourballs in the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who earns four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they called a brilliant action to beat a deflated Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sporadic spores, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, re-matched with Henrik Stenson on the forsomes and fell for 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn't have everything on a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champions, and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for Americans achieving two points on Saturday.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 in the forsome, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the story of Ryder Cup a team had solved a four-point difference to individual parties, although the Furyk team, the title defender, just needs to tie in to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming on Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in any way" if no sign of confidence is seen
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong told the General Assembly of the world organization that North Korea had taken "important good-will measures" in the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing themselves not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't observe any response in the United States consonance," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral full denuclearisation, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang has to eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearisation must first be produced and the pressure level increases with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "declaration of the end of war," Ri pointed out.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a burning of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to the plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea rather than the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from that of last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump named Kim from "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that there is still much to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time limit for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia maintain that the United Nations Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm the complete and final denuclearisation".
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that they had made progress, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "demands of a gangster's own."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures”.
He said Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world’s number one university are often disillusioned with the basic aspects of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to enter the course after learning that some students had a serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, of an hour of duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, babes and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects the sport performance of lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects it has on health smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer makes sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for enough time should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid winning weights, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in in incanition mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes the last year in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home that's another hit outside.
Hebox's set was seeking to add his first home win from the February 4th to St. Johnstone triumph, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team drifting, at 8 points from Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the marker.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, the Livingston rises to the third position, behind the Hibernian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the judge of the Calum Spence line needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently jumped from the grill.
Gerard made eight changes regarding the alignment that the Ayr swept into the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11 headline that picked up a point against Hearts last week, and he was probably satisfied by the way his team, well-organized, suffocated his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scotland Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder shot astray and wasted the great occasion.
A weak launch of Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow made only one shot at the back pole.
The Rangers took over, but they seemed to have more hope than they had in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a 15-minute criminal sign, since he and Steven Lawless met, but arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two jots into the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the docile front Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi on the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers were not able to deal with Jacob’s hard work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted at the break when he changed Coulibally by Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme took a step in Morelos, even though the imponent Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the visitor's attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have yielded the direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a fight diverted from the horn.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton still demanded a last criminal for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as "Geiger accountant."
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What day is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "You sure it's breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that was suffering for more than 18 months.
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, at Bethesda's National Cancer Institute, Maryland (USA): "The results we've obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "protein favors the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" to these cells like treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined a pro-Trump diare with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written in the studio during the program Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance that congratulated the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would be in the 2020 elections.
After his third evening song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program started with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Judicial Committee for sexual assault complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he didn't issue himself, comedian Chris Rock went up recording West's disapproval on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated among the builders because of the hat he wore.
"They threatened me in the backyard.
They told me not to wear that hat.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would wear Superman's coat so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments caused the public to scream at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who told the publication: "The entire study was completely mute."
West was taken as the last hour substitute for Ariana Grande, the former one, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West left much of the public perplexed by the interpretation of the song and Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for putting yourself in the middle of the crowd."
But the presentation of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "existing who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (including his music or clothes or supporting his art") who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and now it was "the former being known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His colleague raper, Snoop Dogg, before his name was Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the seizure of a man on Friday's East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
The throne game star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for representing the role of Spartish Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy game of thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of virile hero, claiming that these papers make it clear that young boys often think they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times magazine, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the throne-game co-protagonist Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has strong determination to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can be a part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they must have this virility facet?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because no doubt something's been wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's full of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will play a replay of Sam Shepard's True West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting her partner Rose is the best game she's ever given her.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life in advance," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple entered their marriage in June 2018 at their family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 reported 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to China's health agents' statements at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Considering the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to lack of proper precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican Party Senators and dismounts "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claimed that the demands pushed them into criticism and websites of extreme right.
"Talks, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitoli during a session of the Senate's commission on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and revealing the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Capitoli.
"This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes him think he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
No challenge has to be shown.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
It must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will make sure the criminals wake up," he continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed each and every one of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It's tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of Johnny English's comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-sater on how we are despicable will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent eye and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. Its name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with tradition of going to cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch by this guy that brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
Originally, it was based on Atkinson's international and mysterious traveler who was now forgotten TV ads from Barclaycard, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the propeller were echoing him in the helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite fluent and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children more than for adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the disquieting of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretense and harassed figure, who is already suffering from a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this impressed character of Teresa-May, but the script does not get any more.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as every active spy is in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the evil Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but providing extra-official classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with its Bough dry skeptic, paper again representing Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, when things get really ugly at Her Majesty's secret service, come into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the tech billionaire charismatic that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madgers: disguised as waiters, burning a French fast-eating restaurant, creating chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, all together looks like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it's not helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and covering five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business leaders to spend their savings with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving workers a day off as a party.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The one-week shift works four days with the support of trade union union union trade Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also imply that shareholders in water companies might not recover all of the investment, since the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in business meetings and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to mix annual dividends for up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment for the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised the question as to whether the agency's findings could influence a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean it," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He stood firm, determined and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I'd present an explosive charge," he said.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," I added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, which carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively combat it.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
What is the success of Global Citizen now that you have 12 years left to achieve your goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just a case we call "clicivism" (a people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37,000 million dollars, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and ads derived from their actions, of which at least $10,000 million has already been disbursed or collected.
The group believes that the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world at the moment.
Some of the major commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and investors with them in the United Kingdom, which commits to "help children grow as well as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page foot of history," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It'll be a long, hard way, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing at the youth event in New York, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to block Russian energy exports (secretary of Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, have revealed U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer's vision" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are actually equal.
"Economic choice in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to get out of the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which cost $11,000 million and will double the existing gas pipeline capacity at 110,000 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers have to be able to choose suppliers, declared Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, the FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to withdraw EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would "think under arrest" her candidacy for the presidency after the election of half a legislature.
During a municipal meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high positions," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously take my candidacy as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said "I was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be presented by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said that the senator should not be presented, according to the survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a wider support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible candidacy for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially disclose his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites TEPT Track Palin's affection at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after listing September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"With what is happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families who suffer from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he told the public at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little different, they get stiff, they come back wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army member, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged for domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and armed youth under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18 state representatives and the district presented a friend curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of Grace vs Sessions case demand that the American Union for Civil Freedoms filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and the children of the violent band member" assaulted her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to ask for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded on the basis of the facts and particular circumstances of the demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to amicus curiae.
Advocates also argued in the report that the policy denying the entry of immigrants is damaging to the US economy, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "propose necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims than to flee domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a concrete political opinion," Sessions told their 11 June announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her child with fever at a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take in flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who have fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are being treated outside because of the heavy shaking they repeat.
Tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with "propaganda announcements."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed the China Daily payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in elections to the US Congress on 6 November, U.S.A., an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what North American officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen to push spiders into mutual imports.
China's vindictive spiders at the beginning of the trade war aimed to punish state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled harassment with the publication of advertising advertisements in our free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert a payment ad to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few discrepant voices and will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the Kavanaugh disaster elections, warn analysts
Since many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces various sexual assault applications, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last hour pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, lead adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants called "November is coming!" as they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby while Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite Ms. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will remain out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; that's true.
But they could have been more, especially among women voters of suburban women and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault claims to the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed with the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, a representative of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor if Kavanaugh sits at the bench of the defendants, it's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps pick Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Star of Ford and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that leans slightly towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in the Ford's testimony in an unprobably or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in an unprobably or possibly Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or proved false during his testimony, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's applications and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez complains that the candidate at the Supreme Court taught him genitals at a party while they were studying Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is excluded from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personally empowered through data."
The idea of Inrut, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills appropriate for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work in the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the website of Inrut.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking them permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice influencing the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guardian on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial tombstone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guarded prowess.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" made the row advance before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members astonished of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prowess that could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a real hero is shown by support that he will receive from many people.
The fans of MMA who stayed sleepless all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you're denied the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and they had to be live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, the United Kingdom viewers were amazed when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted that they had stayed up all night until morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter tracker described the change in cartoons as "a sort of vomitous joke."
"The government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is inadequate, so they changed to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, the vice president of marketing and communication from Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppe la peretta, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they'd work on programming to include United Kingdom viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our hour, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages going and coming, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he has grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio 4 program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to "hope" others.
He also said that being a father was still important to him for winning the Olympics.
The regular feature of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he wasn't socially acceptable like boys and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile LGBT promoter of the movement and has used its image in Australia's youth Commonwealth Games to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world trip said he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are so young (he participated in his early Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone like his age who has experienced such heights and feet.
The couple were parents in the June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was if he already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "stop, you won't be there to fill the first row," he said.
"While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that it was what I had dreamed my whole life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic game.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small Proud), which he had listened to during preparation for the Olympics and still put on chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is released to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson worsened to introduce himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday in playing his 47th game of Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy fita.
Miccelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments buys his time between activating and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the time of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult journey of Le Golf National, where the long rush usually punishes the detours.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, on the ninth game on Sunday, will face the valuable champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the cookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, they start strong, the Miccelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood perfectly his role for that day, made me a slap on my back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It's a Hall of Fame and it's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race to Ryder Cup that hasn't equalized its individual register.
Miccelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draw, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has made the team intangible.
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun getting into it this week, which has been fun seeing.
It adds much more to his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantage the individual dues of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in Valderrama in 1997, when the team headed by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually won the win for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but shortly," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team victory for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which left the score in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that is not over yet.
You have to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the dots go up on the marker.
We have a goal, we try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I said, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
Opposite Bjorn, rival Captain Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than on team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day's payoffs, as he was part of the winning team on Brookline before he ended up losing in the Medina Miracle that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, was motivated by his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start on a good foot, as seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment depending on the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start resuscitation against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I believe it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual clashes.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it would not at least do so until the next year will result in defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The end of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined Armada in 2014, but the post-building problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bucos missiles, as well as technology against theft, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these ongoing delays mean that the advance ships, which were expected to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already news last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Drassana Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time Armada returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
There are few details of the reasons why it has been returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, as it reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Army to add improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz, will weigh twice as much as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached a surprising 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new frauds have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Army "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer claimed that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but no one was provided again as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Army.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how the landscape is used by the batpenates to feed.
It is expected that discoveries will be able to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, in addition to northern earrings and water in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track bat activity during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Sound analysis of records by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Conservation Advisor of the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are more important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for batpenates and other associated species.
The ratpen population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and ignition also pose a risk, just like mass-killing paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles that stand in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with proper training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the Three Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight out of ten species of ratpenate from Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and still a good habit.
But we still know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before doing property maintenance tasks, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
Ratpenates are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Ratpenate Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has claimed that people "want to be famous" by his name.
His lawyers will sue for the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The head of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of violating a American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a 33-year-old video of Instagram Live addressing his 142 million followers after the accusations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to be famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have called "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage due to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in the past few years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After he met at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the reports filed in the Jutjat of Clark County County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except for "1%."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual intercourse, but they were consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries to the hospital, but later he agreed to an agreement outside the courts because he had "for retaliation" and he was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to set up for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he was charged with the juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret it," if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worry" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in case of an unagreed Brexit could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Getting out of the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU will work has aroused the fears of other U.S. car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims he'll close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the production chain in case of Brexit with no agreement.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just time" basis, with pieces coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it should stop production as a consequence.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers' plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
We want to get the best deal we can, as I say, not only enjoy today's success, but also take this opportunity," the BBC Radio 4 program said.
"The testing not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota couldn't confirm how long the production would stop, but in the long run, he warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union on the plant, said that members start to be very concerned about the situation: "Experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "posted for a week" while continuing the fight over the appointment of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and help in Trump and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired or not the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record Trump's talks and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
On Thursday, however, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to prevent a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which led to further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: "Even if no date has been set, it could be this week, although it may be that it will delay another week for all matters with the supreme court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists could refute this statement: Sanders has not done any information session of the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of informational sessions wasn't why he didn't like television reporters' hoard, even though he said, "I won't deny they're gonna be fans."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders said that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to directly ask the president of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We're often trying to do this, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service due to fears for Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the EU's release.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be headed for the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and more importantly, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers relay has undergone an emergency operation after being injured on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ, from Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before half.
"He came to the band line and collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting him in a bed and taking him to make more evidence.
An officer from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris of WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type or extent of injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it's from Illinois.
I had completed five plaques Saturday before I left the game, which make a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom with additional money used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to lure young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded on those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The list expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
It is expected that a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom will be charged to foreign buyers, and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to lure young voters with promises of providing safer habitats that would affect higher yields.
The increase in the stamp tax will be charged to those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be allocated to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
List expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many of the country's bountiful areas, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great constructions of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rental controls and termination of "no blame".
He also wants to give the joints more power to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be right that it's just as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom as well as for businesses with theirs abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is coaching Scotland."
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish has accepted the challenge of revising the north-east club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a support, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's coach office include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's coach claims that he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just consider I've been successful here if I could get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid the descent to the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he recalled about taking the charge at the Alloa.
"I always thought training was what I was given better than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I came out rationally and enjoyed quite good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard since I'm a grown-up."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave fired consumption in Britain's hard bars, but added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA's financial counseling, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the World, which has been longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in the bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption at June restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while eating at restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer to eat have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the restaurant case.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
At the bars and taverns we have consulted, drinks sales have increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, from the city analysts and RSM hotels, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the foreign market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% during the year would be especially harmful, rather than continuing pressure for costs.
This long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-serving trades and time will say if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including recently opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowness in the presentation of brands.
The Sales Indicator of The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to a survey
A poll of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years of age, believe social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "primary" account that shows parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "violate me."
The investigation, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Committee of Private School Directors of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, of which half has admitted to have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "visus of the athletes" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed a non-executive director of the Scottish athletic federation directive at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the field athlete and track with more medals from Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has respect for the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm looking forward to acting as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won the gold at 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's about to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
A headline that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tourniquet company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an announcement that compares nursing mothers to mixing cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "first silent curtain that can be brought from the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a playful music video to show the freedom that gives the new puppet to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ironing and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm moving myself, but you're not going to see any tails" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not handcuffs, but my breasts."
The return goes on: "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, lug girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom say it shows the "horrors" of the secular industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie tirallet is hidden discreetly in a lactation supporter (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a bottleneck for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out-of-place ad."
Other people defended the advertisement; one woman admitted that finding the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the bowl made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another person commented the following: "It's a fun announcement to mothers that bomb with bullets (usually in their workplace or in the toilet and feel like cows.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the secular industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the drawer quietly placed on the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the tirallet.
However, Elvie's tirallet is completely silent, has no cable or tube and it fits discreetly into a nursing bra, which gives women more freedom to move, subject babies and even go out as it pumpes.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first childhood nurse and developer, said: "Elvie's tirallet is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a curtain is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new curtain offers.
It's not the first time Elvie is on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the bridge for designer Marta Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children, quietly moved to a tents camp at the Texas border
The number of detained emigrants has increased despite the fact that monthly entries across the border have remained practically stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult to prepare children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to risk their chance to stay in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs control officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
" Nearly 80 percent of the people who have taken in or lived in a home of a person who has taken in are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to keep chasing these people," Albence said.
To process children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to be brought to trial within a month of being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than by presence, to defend their case to obtain legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help, will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports that the system has given in recent months.
Advocates claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where they are more likely to ignore the signs that a child is suffering.
They've added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that they're already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Mualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," she said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror almost is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the refugee issue, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for "irrational reasons" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition takes place to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone to the last great rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's assistance in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has a "clear terminis" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, sent from the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and opposition to begin to profile a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump's going to win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the process of dismissal ended with their presidency prematurely.
What would be, of course, "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
For the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of full-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at maximum time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of theMSNBC, has led cable television audiences to 3.5 million viewers on the main informative nights.
"People have seen themselves in the office because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, the executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survival", about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him I'd vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered that because he made her laugh," said Scovell.
There's an entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the families of immigrants can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you are at the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15 grand coat coat jacket ("a piece of heavy clothing as his pride", held the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario any more.
"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a TV show is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" on the character changes and the screenplays of Trump's program (knocking with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and I was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but it was closed looking at theMSNBC while I was recording CNN.
He couldn't disengage himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

External money inundates the races of the most adjusted parliamentary elections in the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that has caused two current members to compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who got the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were drafted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were divided unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a highly followed special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
The political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the "new decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert said, spoke to the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which in 2017 received US grants of $140 million, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutbacks in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths for murder and arrest.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended with any probability of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for the mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration gives to it, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys made a discreet return to their Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration, and also from anonymously, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event in the event could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
As far as you know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the body, just when he prepares to do so in front of the voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
They are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, nor any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovacs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over such inflection points and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing various inflection points today.
What if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been with water on his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the charge.
Rosenstein claims the information in the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, in particular, will we vote for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for this?
If we don't pass this test, democracy will start to run into danger.
But I think we won't fail, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light candles from Saturday at that table with the swastika.
With this bag, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic towards the Vienna Rapid Party
The Rangers received the Rapid Vienna Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive fourth in the Vila-Real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Group of G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until quarter 2-2 against the Royal Vila, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trap for great results.
"It was a good point for us, because Vila-Real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out in the end, but in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first part, but we were better at the second part.
About Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a hard game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it all and we'll get a good result with the fan support.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give everything, leave the season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep for fear of savings for retirement
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking about it with the family.
Approximately half of respondents at national level claim to have talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent of respondents say they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't dare to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children about how you can prepare your family for not communicating your wishes in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation. It can also help you determine how you pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a long-term care insurance policy, a long-term hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the passage to the legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary authority for your finances.
It is important to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Specifies these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also what doctors are trying to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man got several shots of a compressed air gun as he returned home after going out at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when they shot him in his chest, his abdomen, and his hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place about 2.30 in the morning (in British summer time) as a random act.
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is safe from injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Since communications are cut, relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Domgala region, an area north of Palu nearest to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data about Palu and Dogula, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was on its 40th birthday, during an earthquake and tsunami.
Domulaa is a region that extends along more than 300 km of coast northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Domgala.
The exploration of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it mainly concentrates on Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Dogliana have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Dongala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and there are often earthquakes.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years have been listed below:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook a pop zone in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude struck one of the islands of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 metres [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pdie Jaya regime in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: A series of great earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges for assault.
Palin, 29, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known man tried to call the police to denounce the alleged crimes, he pulled out his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Centre, where he is held with a non-guarantee obligation of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin is facing three class A faults, which means he could go to prison until a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also accused of a class B lack, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are registered against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
Her partner said she had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her child's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from her service to Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake took place right on the coast of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcasts videos with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane at the West Side Highway, at Lower Manhattan, and run a road ride and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intendedly" caused serious personal injuries, according to the warning of intent to apply for the death penalty in the South New York district.
Both crimes could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-handed indictment that included eight accusations of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York district brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted by conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 fault charge.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty, instead of accepting a conviction of guilt and a life imprisonment without the possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party's parliament asserts that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
UKIP's former leader said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of Theresa May's parliament themselves suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when conservatives in favour of the union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to preserve Chequers' commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the Union's supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and press the Euroseptics and the Conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Leave Means Leave de Solihull rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed as a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out already,' she said.
Parliamentarian Wellingborough added, "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers' engagement."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is completely false."
Brexit Conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, to listen to people."
"The compromise of Chequers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win some election.
Abandon Checkers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a question of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union’s supporters marched for Birmingham before holding a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A small number of activists shook flags over conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of running the presidency as a candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll examine the possibility of running as a candidate for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critique of President Donald Trump, presented himself for his re-election in November against the state representative of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation on the possibility of raising Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of open meeting since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is high time that "women go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for killing Sims, LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect for death has been arrested from the LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET Press Conference.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and requested collaboration to identify the man from the subway.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to custody of the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebots per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas stood before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes before and left Hamilton running in traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxes and go after Vettel, but Hamilton stepped after some wheeled action that caused Ferrari's pilot to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third horn.
Max Verstappen began in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he went to the seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then went on to get much of the career, which kept his wheels up to save time, move on to Kimi Raikkonen, and move on to fourth position.
He finally got into the boxes at round number 44, but he couldn't increase his pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a great job to have one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and liars."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate last days, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel, and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filtrations and they say "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?"
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered-- no, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and filtered in September, but Feinstein denied the filtration of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept him confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using statements for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, no matter who they hurt, who they have to trap for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Friday in Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 on Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-way advantage thanks to the finishings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth season encounter between the two teams and the Giants that won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial hectic period, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game in the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage at the first break when he got the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal to the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and secured the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next match Friday.
A driver dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
A air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a massive earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday and unleashed a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area and there's a lot of people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grand, refused to leave his place in the tremendous control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that Batik 6321 flight, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We set up a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Dongula, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that have not been reached," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six feet [6 m], have devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and failures.
Kusuma Risa, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the de minimiss have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the work related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the pond
The airline that operated a flight that's going to crash in a Pacific pond in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew safely evacuated the plane that went down.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked in the pond because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the lead.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who had been working close to it to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 metres into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in recorded aircraft accidents in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst makes up a story of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst at the Paul Rowlett Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described the jury as using mobile phone records to build the prosecution's 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for a couple of weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it from his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to initiate its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury's trial to take place the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills your music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed of Bristol ensures that hip-hop has separated from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and re- fashion the conscious hip-hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom from the hands of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY maid asks a couple to fire after a "racist" message
A New York nurse has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple deny they're racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOA OTHER NEGAL PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs Maurice twice.
After finding out about her pygia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and was later sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice claims to the couple a compensation for the dismissal and asks for a compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residence work for which they had hired him, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they were racists claiming Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to an "extortion," claimed his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and to condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to put herself in someone's place than lly for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small red bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agreduce", after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and shows that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was as real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's none of your business.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter quickly to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nada often called to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect it to pass," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Now I got a call from Nad and he told me he'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs he had been given because his body was still beating themselves up and they were getting out of their system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep my shape right."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"No one knew it," he said.
"He had a sharp head and tears were still falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her a lot."
Women of mourning hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, with Lydney's residence, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm continually concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people to whom you can turn, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he wasn't feeling well nor that he was depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A couple days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said that his death would be a great trauma to them, but they would have to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI starts an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the deadlock of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Your reluctance has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man who wants to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to clear the room and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea deserters "caut" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South Unity said that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices of human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
Normally, most Northern deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has a longer border with North Korea, and it's easier to create the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and is not fit to work at the High Court.
The Minority Leader of House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate for the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament is unable to work for the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her it's a "histeric," Pelosi said in relation to his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the charges of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and being speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said that the charges against him were a " grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that the witness in Kavanaugh had shown that he could not work at the High Court because he showed prejudice against democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed some reluctance when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's choice, if it's confirmed, and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell Congress or FBI the truth, you're not only not able to be in the High Court, but not in the court where you are now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh is serving as a judge at the Appeals Tribunal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions as to whether he would cancel certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and expect it to look wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diarrhage: months and years of abundant fury and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon." And you?"
He continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it went on.
It seemed bright to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a masculine majority, where I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a colder directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me from the crate and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll get you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me as she laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "Blanc and the seven dwarfs."
Since he was late for the campaign, he delayed his fundraiser, so he promised he wouldn’t join the race if he didn’t raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she asked.
When he delivered his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and guiding voters, instead of doing so to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that was left speechless.
"It might have been thought she had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put in my grave?
"Did you cry?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the U.S.-China trade war were disturbing, and although the war does not seem to have to end quickly, a distance from countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new spiders affecting products worth $200,000 million, and these spiders assume a tax tax on half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly countered in the same way and recently climbed the wires from five to ten percent for 60,000 million dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will come to a close.
Making Washington back involves yielding to some demands, but publicly leaning in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated," says Abigail Grace, a leading research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the return of refugees voluntarily and asks for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are fulfilled.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Still others are no longer associating with the Christian congregation.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown once again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, struck the water in the hole by 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari brightened all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated by a 5&4 player from the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection in Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't mean to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important -- and I'm glad I could help," said a excited Garcia after European victory.
He highlights his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual Sunday competition.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a career record in Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought the whole weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pushed the European selection.
We fought.
I take my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's to take off your hat.
We've been defeated."
