Inflation, in Europe, has broken down on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than the forecast, following an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office located in Luxembourg.
Official estimates indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with the growth of commodity prices and lower unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The market share of cereals has increased by 88 percent and soya prices have also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose by 52 per cent and, last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month rate of inflation remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the Governing rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance des Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Study Institute) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 percent.
For the faithful electors, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth (20 percent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrat Alliance) are below the level of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
The number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 per cent among the faithful voters.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared with the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly severe has never been as high, rose to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects an aggravation and only one tenth foresees an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of the respondents, a majority who had never seen in Gallup's previous polls, found that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of polls have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister fully and 27 percent to the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of the polls wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intent to vote, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent additional said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be clear.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrolment fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stays.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation costs and hospital stay costs respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained an average price increase of 16% last year, compared to the fact that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Day Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas Cart also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown in" in the major food stores last December, were no longer brutally increased compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily bakery in the surveyed hypermarkets has exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey net, walnut and peacock have increased sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising, too in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle contained in two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it was only 257 forints the bottle included.
It does not prevent that this year, in terms of Daily Shopping Cart, Auchan was the cheapest and the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the daily price of her Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and the cheapest basket this year, we find a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year's lowest and most expensive one is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, the prices increased by an average of 1,206 perforated, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been observed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade perplexing, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin they apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a merchant miscalculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in VAT rate, the increase in daily Cart prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was greater than 1,720 forged at the value of the 2006 rate, whereas the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forged.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the most expensive basket value was higher than last year's 1,630 and the prices at least increased by 1,284 also forged.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics found an increase in prices by more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to his daily bakery, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the evidence, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in making the price increases brutally accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they keep recording good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-conservation food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important tails formed at the caisses of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain about not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overrun of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma service of the hospital János.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The wounded in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return there because of an MRSA infection and since then doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
It is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacilline-resistant gold staphylococcus.
One third of the people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
SA infections (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) are very responsive to antibiotics, which are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium that is highly resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged immune system malfunction, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, low weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
Above all, you don't have to confuse infection with the epidemic, you don't find MRSA just the one or you don't look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff put gloves in rubber and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in mode
While the vast majority of MRSA infections may be prevented, current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz says.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases only see the day if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the Chief Physician of the Epidemiological Center said.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA thrives from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, to put gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient may not always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in the end of the epidemic, the patients should be kept away from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals in difficult financial situations save disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many sick people, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in demonstrably, or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditures for social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not drunk
The official statement on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his position since, which crushed a pedestrian by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to drunken or oblivion, communicated Friday, Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting on the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former commander of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his own car, on the 22nd arrondissement Kossuth Lajos Street. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(On the other hand, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police, he was greatly disturbed by this accident.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigations Department.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements with a total value of EUR 400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, whose credit contract of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, and this time the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, while the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would recover from the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans not mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market which is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and, on the shores of the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Côte du Sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly searching for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also growing to buy in the cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promising the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The most vigilant investors already buy large numbers, for example in Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria at the same time seek to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or from old delegated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general to the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since December last, Bulgaria is listed among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in hopes of achieving a medium- or long-term plus-value.
The price of capital buildings is growing steadily as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, professional meetings are ending on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the Ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, lively discussions are taking place between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss accurate figures, but they were prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction by 2020 of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund established by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of 16 members probably under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) communicated Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its admiral ship role in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 per cent compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol's signatory countries had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time had made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The issue is high in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place in the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units report on the video-sharing site on recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who was passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan had video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the headquarters of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is indisputable
The Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and released videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office (Commonwealth) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to inform the general public of the actual objectives of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs virtually nothing in relation to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. However, it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game
The army is excited because, apart from the videos composed and carefully censored, amateur videos have been passed on to the shared site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the operating areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were actually carried out, but the British army had been packed for loading these videos only recently.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the position of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and Beignets in the Ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beignets and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a live music festival, another will charm the officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas ambiance, concerts and buffet, so fun power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forforints to create the end-of-year environment.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) will feast.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be harsh, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized in the National Council of Justice building (ILO) on Wednesday with concerts and dinners.
The rental of the room has cost one million forks, the rest has been spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organised with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a company managing tenders.
The Gaite Theatre building has been rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas feast, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on December 7.
The ILO has not paid them the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the welcome of the minister and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the [origo] question: the evening was not at all mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Work and Local Communities are preparing a party on.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 for Forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and ninety people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat beignets, provided the press service, the festival will not cost more than 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his employees to take a drink in the room of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas celebration in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It is expected to spend 2,500 per guest, including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is enhanced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the hour of the holiday taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the Town Hall, and according to the Department's communication, 1,000 per person forints are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few welcome words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not celebrate Christmas at all, they communicated their press services to [origo].
The Ministry of the Environment's press service did not know the price of the official Christmas celebration.
However, over four hundred people were invited to the celebration organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather together
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, on Friday, constitute their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate Monday strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (common transport company) will also strike until 13h.
The Unions of the League will inform, Friday afternoon, of the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Advice.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be formed and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on a follow-up.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Fund Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important stopovers are foreseen in the traffic: the railways will stop the work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the joint transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies will be in danger of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for a strike, and the list of trade unions is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report the strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MáV (Hungary Railway Roads) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZZZ) have not been able to reach agreement on minimum services, or, as they approach Christmas parties, more and more are taking the train.
According to the current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of the Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Union of Professors and the Democratic Union of Professors called for a strike for 2 and 2 hours to 8 hours, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternation, the Health and Social Sector Employees' Syndicate (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its health reform proposal and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be set up from next year will be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would enable the system to pass the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZZZ), linked to the League Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning secondary rail lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary) increased, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the escalating ethnic tension already existing between the Georgian and non-Tzigan population of Hungary."
The research institute has added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main gaps of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the Hungarian and international media's activity "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, particularly with regard to confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity."
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 and have been called "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare that they are preparing their members for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if it is necessary, if necessary, to increase, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, or the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going through the method, which, based on political society and parties' resentment, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The emphasis on civil character and association status is therefore only to avoid legal pitfalls in the registration of such associations in court, but also to constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk from neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roma troubles that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of Bulgarian guard.
By taking advantage of these events, the UNB has decided to serve as a guard saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked strong discussions in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own custody as resistance indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the telephone agency's request for information, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days the number of which will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the alarmers can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the revolution in 1848, as on October 23 that is also the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the feast of work and November 1 and 2, we remember the members of our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in the case or there is only one working day left before or after the celebration marked in red.
It is true that we pay for extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on days of replacement of days before or after holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions which operate continuously and in service, through their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year's holidays: as of December 24, life ends almost throughout the country because according to the experiences the majority of people do rather overtime or take vacations they have saved for these purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
The next year a lot of holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around the working party to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 25, will be a day of work for a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a nonstop break even if the new year day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly haunt colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that offend us almost more: these are things that "pretty" the daily life of a place of work.
The question is whether we are used to these problems or we face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you we called you marketing service," said a colleague.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (that is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or a phone and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember you put the staple on the desk the other day, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they're right to be angry with you for slapping their possessions.
Don't get any envelopes, any posters in your pocket, because it can be embarrassing that there's no more and you need them right now.
You're a partner in the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop potential spreaders.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (subjects) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you declaring yourself ill without just reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick on the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, you think that your work, your urgent business, your missions should be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that will make you stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues so they don't make any sense of your absence the next day.
Cooling, blackmailing, telephone
You're going into your job, but your colleagues' scratching you out brutally?
Did you become, without wanting to, witness a phone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with colds, singing, loud discussions (which you carry over their heads), foot beatings, big words or discontent expressed out loud.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send a mail or important message, don't accuse anyone for that forget!
Don't put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has brought inconvenience to others, repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair neglect!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Getting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting
We slowly move into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm soundin' up.
Music changes rhythm and bass comes to accompany the tones from all to hour, then a female chorale comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's Wings of Love song.
Hungarian music has not wasted us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground slowly begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he starts on his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz ally, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The early training in small clubs started to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important albums of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also compete in the west.
Zagar and his whole became indisputably "threshold" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted the right way, he got a new and better disc.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there well with reference to flight but next to air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, which has been broadcast recently from the popular music from the morning to the evening, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's fine (?).
hvg.hu asked questions in Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial and sincere music.
The music itself says alternatives, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also operates in this spirit irrespective of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course I'm happy to see people coming to our concerts more and more.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or the influence of each other already works, but it is perceived only in the inseparable changes of the moment.
I noticed, though, that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you're not going to be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has been a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music should be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the square of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube so we could sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to soften sound org and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choral.
We had the idea of composing this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
This was composed of the six-member chorale, Sena, Edina Kitzora, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Judge Nemeth, who was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song had long existed in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The sequence of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang even the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert I also thought the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's solo short), they don't have a single role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music does only accompany their song.
They were behind the stage, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love take us.
I wanted the others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song did you get most to work on?
Zs.B.: Actually, nothing about the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "dropped" this disc.
At the moment, this is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader trusts billions at risk because of his inferiority complex
A covert fraudr.
This means his former employee the French giant the Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost €5 billion because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Contrary to all major banks, he acknowledged in time the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
"It's fragile," they told his superiors who denounced him to the police.
However, if we look at Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "subprime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or to those who had experienced reimbursement difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to €1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that, of course, he didn't keep anything to himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses that he failed the reports so as not to be dismissed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eureka stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
No, I'm not.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does he want to risk so much?
He only gradually succeeded in his position.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never gain as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my career and personal course," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
As a result of Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by putting down this title during the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, you're left in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that is when the beginning of the year comes.
It loses one billion euros in one day.
On mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czechia has the opportunity to earn 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czechia can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain as part of these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new management methods that are more efficient.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of the EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was convicted in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was assigned to reside in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, based between 1997 and 2002, will be re-incarcerated for the time being, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officials, or they will let Germany finish its sentence at his home, or I will again be in prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
They were fictional companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and to his closest supporters.
A portion of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to fund its election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's right.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority government without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year spent a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote on the defiance statement to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law, which, although most influential, is usually overlooked.
Here's some sort of paradox.
Whether it is desired or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that's why he's given more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are of much greater interest to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first being the important part granted to the costs of mandates imposed by law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest allea.
The latter is public and relatively under control.
The real late bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, hazing down their municipalities, to obtain, apart from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If it is only official and verifiable, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for many years, just like the rest of the world, a growth phase and ČSSD does not lack to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that essentially falls back on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programs that have, just in recent years, unfortunately needlessly inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending has been eliminated, approved last year before the elections, if a gap in the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone will be in power, it will only be administered.
By simply exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes regular costs remanded by the mandate costs.
The budget deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not spent as much money as they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can spend only the equivalent of what happens to be tax and tax, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Resolve the Crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auctions and will also provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take a concerted action to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to the clients of the Economic Outlook Group Council.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect other billions of losses.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be pursued," said the Chief Economist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
The Central Banks are concerned that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to bring down the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English Central Banks have fallen their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Bank approach will not help to resolve the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to harm especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a fusion of words, ersatz solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he commits himself to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, as he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, in his opinion, he had sufficient provisions to write such a book.
He is an academic who is capable of monitoring and valuing scientific treaties, has the practice of statistics and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are the following: the changing climate, its changes are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition to having the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have let the deadline expire and have failed to renew their former driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities can issue a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will enter the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licence especially those who no longer want to drive.
While communes report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are infested with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has gone up this week.
The City Hall meets about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not renewed their driving licences yet.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the issue within a short five-day period.
In this case, the driver pays an extra five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will enter the road without a valid permit, will risk a fine from January onwards.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to former information, it was likely even a fine for a person who was not going to travel.
By doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is in danger of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exception.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should return their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also required to progressively renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties for detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will be 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The Prague High Court has therefore definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk for 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgement, only a appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently waiting for the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty of holding up 19 people, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after agreement among themselves with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the lark to Opava and Koňařík.
In the indictment the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, which in most cases has suffered serious health damage, as well as abuse of authority by a public agent and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang was enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found other people guilty of armed robbery Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighbourhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, avoided Tomáš P in prison and Maroš Šulej in Ireland, where they await the final decision concerning their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of substitutes for children: 12 million
Lawyer Igor Veleba wants to obtain a compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the Třebíč hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at Ondřej Dostál hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, this is very high," said Dostál at the release of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We'll check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál pointed out.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked for a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological harm and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better sustained by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, who remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening right now, summed up the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on December 9th.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslave and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil has, at the end of October, handed over to each of the families 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechia are obliged by law to insurance in civil liability.
In the event of failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may ask for assistance from the manager.
Up to now, the courts have acknowledged relatively little compensation, and the amounts calculated according to the tables were around hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valašské Kralovství brand (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, he had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polyvka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic about Bolek Polyvka's popularity," said Polyvka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko's Kingdom evoke the actors and comics to everyone.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's an almost ten-year job behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
It is they who want to paralyze on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the Valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) title for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no relation to the project to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making passports of the Valašské Království appear.
From humorous action originally, there was a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were cited in the passport and even proposed to the holders of the balances on the price of his farm visit and theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only made use of the bare idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské královstvi project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polyvka.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated with the statement "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as the mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, calling for the court to reject today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half the princess.
He's supposed to get a new king out of it.
He did not want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, of driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many ways, be described as being inferior to the average.
At present, however, there is its successor to Peugeot 207 that, she is significantly better.
Especially since the combo named SW goes one step further, I just need to think better.
When I was testing the classic touchback of Peugeot 207 I was complaining about, for example, the space for the head on the back seats.
As this ends the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let's see how fast it is.
I'm going to mention the inside very quickly so I won't repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, as the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time we could complain about seats or too short folders is revolutionized.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of bodywork is also sensitive there.
The combo also disappears the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A safe in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle, therefore, is its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivot ice) and a rather easy scratch.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
It makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in relation to competition a rather average figure.
Separated from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle in Czechia.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we find that Peugeot remains very sensitively behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to leaving abroad on leave or loading a pushover, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the lower case remaining after the reverse of the files of the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low walkway.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes family hitchback walk.
It is quiet, it consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an escape pot blocked by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Traveling rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable to all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liter engine of 329,900 Kč is still valid.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
In addition to airbags, we have automatic air conditioning, self-winding, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of account 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to Fabian's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there is only one left to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is difficult
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concern among the residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of the Europeans of the East is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of people of origin turn into violence.
The case of Kent in the north, where there is a growing emphasis on the opposing conflicts of Slovak origin and immigrants, illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The fights, the chicana and the fights between the students have moved into the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who had an iron bar with a ten-year-old student.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist statements.
The police also had to respond to the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed over the bus stop and started to spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded by apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," said another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify for conflict with immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases referred to above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
All you expect from your leave can be realized if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails.
The kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but will be enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the U.S. Mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the last century's 50', circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of the entire America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still travel to Havana, since the jigous and old-times imported have been in such a salty and wet climate for a long time.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green light.
For the past 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially Varader, on the coast of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another fantasy that is unique to the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended in the sugars on a narrow road by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and so we can see small locomotives that are not only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most known places.
So there's no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Unless you recall that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks climb up into the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile soil being caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is where Cuban tobacco is likely to be grown of the best quality.
You can find the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the trade of slaves and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness has been incarnate in the beauty and character of this small city.
Coloniální španělská architecture, výrazně ovllíněná medějšími francuzskými osadníky, čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Escambray, is a place so far away that in the last century's 50', there was no road that would link this region to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stand aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolition anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música that is excited after sunset and where music is only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located on the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that flow from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the East Cuban equéile, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it has seen the day about a hundred years after the periple of Colomb) and from the hill where the old castle-fort lies and the present hotel El Castillo, we see several Table Mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, the massive Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Truries and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Holy Patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a lot of pages.
Only, just as we say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, has an impact on the progress of the mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan is not expected to take place as it should, and the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed to Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing dispute by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States called this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates the NATO troops to a greater extent, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development assistance as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
The other being allowing people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said the British Defence Minister Des Browne at the BBC.
Ninety-tenths per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. Army, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which almost one quarter in the south.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The NATO Secretary General Jaap of Hoop today held similar statements.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would take three days.
Which is passive
The last few months also exist among the countries involved in conflict on the issue if all the allies do indeed do in Afghanistan as much as possible.
For example, Germany was criticized for its liabilities.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements of which they are subject are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The fierce Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," writes Sun in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on a counterattack by posting a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The burden of a government debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is charged to each Czech.
The total debt is raised, at the end of September, to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a change in government budget savings, the Department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
Thus, during the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, however, it has declined by 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its government debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted to more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the border of only one billion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns," said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of the analyst for Next Finance Vladimir Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion by the year 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts Increase
The government's debt is constituted by central government's debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government's debt is financed by securities from the treasury, annuities, direct loans or, for example, from loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average exigency of the government's debt was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased internally from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the incomes in which it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when pension reform comes," commented the Pikora data.
Better than expected
It follows from the state debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, due to a change in savings in the state budget, the Department has reduced the estimated amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially the deficit in the state budget, which is clearly rising to 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Next, these are the maximum sources provided for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state-independence securities for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's borrowings amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She was comparing today to a court in Khartoum for having appointed a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was convicted on Thursday evening by a Khartoum court at 15 days' imprisonment and expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving students between 6 and 7 years old to name a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a whipping penalty.
This 54-year-old British institute in charge of the United High School in Khartoum in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with assault on Islam and Sediment under article 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students from the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher in the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name," he said, "innocent error."
Opinion shared by many students of the institute who describe it as "very attentive to his students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Let us recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second name most often given in Britain, he writes in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion meeting on the future status of the separatist province on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, which means that there are obvious tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which are the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated with 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ishinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that the EU's independence under supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not agree on it.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately no agreement was found," announced the President of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, said his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "belonged to a past that led to killings and deportations."
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, among other things, to have a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: at the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush pulled an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference held in Annapolis on Tuesday, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start immediate negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old contentment between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, said Bush, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "roadmap" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This designation covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and comprehensive" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert committed himself to making future talks "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his "two-State vision" Palestinian and Israeli co-existence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had reached a commitment in the direction of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the root of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Sauud in his interview with Saudi-capital Arab daily.
The police are not responsible for the prosecution.
What exactly happened Sunday?
Like every time in this different kind of act, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the survey of the National Police Inspectorate (GNI), a police car was circulating shortly after 17 hours, Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophary," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road” (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circulated “very well”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," said a police officer.
The alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle proved negative.
The state of the car (formerly defused, star windshield, broken bumper) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted persons in danger" to the IGNN, a colossian with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGN's investigation at this stage differed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a sort of scratch, probably caused by the rustling of the chalks on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were kept closed as long as the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a rumor soon circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have quickly left the places, thus not providing help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while being careful, would also rule out "all serious mistakes" concerning this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which to be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the stage.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, trying to scratch them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely feudy cop, who was kicking.
Two others were trying to reinvigorate one of the young people, the fourth was on the phone."
Faced with the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the people who were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues arriving at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services have not provided assistance to young people.
These young men have been severed.
Firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
The tension is rising in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the state of emergency were injured by the lacchymogenic grenades used by law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter rebutted by stone jets, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been requested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers at the bar of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties grouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' exhorted the people to send flowers to the judges who have spoken against the state of emergency and the debris to those who have sworn before Musharraf'.
'' Musharraf's promise no longer prevails''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly addressed by the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was due to take action in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential on 6 October at the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was defeated and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court judgments'', said the magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president 'hold no more' after the state of emergency was established, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
To abandon his military uniform was due by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government denied the country's insistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been granted residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
The liberalisation of contraception has also allowed a better "fertility mastership", according to the Institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated in the month near for a couple of five and if possible in the spring, season considered as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is essential for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky release that accumulated records due to its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "crickled" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded the Harmony Module, a large cylindrical room for the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a sort of dock for the desktop modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to place it on its final position.
After moving, the crew began redeploying the solar panels of the module, which have a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged on about one meter by a cable that stuck.
Deployment has been stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracle at the end of 30 meters long of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very dignified, it has the torso very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was charged with "acting" the "stricken" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he hacked the wrong cable and installed sorts of "arms" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-skirt hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "brickled" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying its tools and returning the station's interior.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of half a day's relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to the planned Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in the stock exchange
The EADS action is now clearly falling at the Paris stock exchange, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its expected operational result for 2007 as a result of the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditiones the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of covering the delay in delivering its military aircraft, announced in October, is 'EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be required to announce new operating result objectives (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without more quantified details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a TV message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of a Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overpowering.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transpired by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of real democracy and we want honest elections, the most transparent and open elections, without any acquittals," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far from counting.
It denounces a campaign launched with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that there were "never such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former champ in the chess world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsuspended legislation there are two more open questions:
- Who's going to be next in Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper issued yesterday the date of the first round of the Presidential on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
He was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin was unable to issue a third consecutive mandate.
But no successors emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The leader of the parliamentary majority and of the powerful Russian party united who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, to the legislatures as well as to the presidential, the power coming out will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the Soviet homo's mindset, they don't feel master of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has slowed down in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has slowed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the people all the more that this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "responsibly renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
“What do you want to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) running the local lists of Russia united.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists on behalf of the Russians.
Concluding Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What good is thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were so far accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his entitled.
The 11 states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, and openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening of these nominating documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to give them proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Antisemitism Research Centre at the University of Berlin Technical University in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers gave their green fire to the European Commission in April to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A pact of free trade for the two economies enormously" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Duraro Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday was concerned about alleviating the current return of credit concerns, and announced a ten billion-pound offer at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly severe at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its provision of reserves for the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a communiqué.
The bank states that €10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time BoE seems to have placed the five-week liquidity market in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
BoE adds in its communiqué that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis with its basic rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England's amounts on the market had a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the book price compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, to more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse examination of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text was included in a socialist "nice" (during the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted by the national PS office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the reinstatement of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or the rental framework.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was lifted following the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes vivid, between a majority and a few hours' opposition to the television intervention by Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchasing power.
PS Leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
As a result of many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the UK producer Melvin Benn Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with someone who has, no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones de C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took the bar from the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of the "most inspiring event" to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones de C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"Our planes chose Philadelphia as a market and worked with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic by this project.
Unfortunately, we have become involved in politics because of the current administration, continued Charlie Jones.
"Herely, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after starting in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban settings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours are taking place in urban green spaces," said Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival in the European and urban region to America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, eagerly supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but asserts "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very great", like that of 80,000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been made to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed when going to the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will vary there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays in Montreal when no other Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - “politically difficult” because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the “runaway productions”.
Is it difficult to play in the Governor's legs?
"Be careful, the industry decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll be there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge best," he says.
The festival race
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote the cinema here.
The Oscars race started.
It will be of all festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year stock exchange rally? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in the hope that the traditional year-end rally will arrive.
However, this year the experts are not as certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock market generally has a positive behaviour.
However, statistics-based forecasts should not be made, since, given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least on the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the stock exchange in recent weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leaking to quality values both in long and short periods."
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "mostly because we do not know the impact of the probable decline in Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of inflationary tension stimulation"
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," the expert assures.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, Analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution festival (6 December).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, Analyst of Investment Bank, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebounding of the index that could be caused according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, from Investors Bank, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and industry.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they move.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only two occasions in December has been a month's kisser.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the growth of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds on its end-of-year rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m. and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Banque Populaire's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely the goal that the People's Bank pursues.
Attract the autonomous customers who travel around these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the timetables is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colours.
The bank trader, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mondocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the moment, they reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telefive doubles for the first time the stock exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a managing advisor to Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was tarnishing his joy: 'what hurts me, it's not the fact that we're getting bigger but we're getting less down' he said.
However, he emphasized that on a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% in one year.
The value in the Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who gave up 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% decrease since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Five Days) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Anenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the managing branch of Telecinco and Publiespaña, said.
In order for this data to be true, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year for the current fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antwerp 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009, to 7%.
This is due, as they explain, to lower expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Annane's earnings from 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Ibersecurities recommends buying both values based mainly on its high profitability of dividends and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Madrid Caja sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Anenne 3 (maintenance) for multiple attractions ' and increased business.

JPMorgan: It recommends considering both cases as it has had 'like threats' (a saturated market and a poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote by Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate the organization's business in detail for the effective functioning of the markets.
Mifid, which amends the Values Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, at the time it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the National Values Market Commission (NCMV) leaders and promotes cooperation among the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consultation services both for specialized social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which merge value companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and international order systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms, and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they perform, in order to facilitate control by the NMCV.
In passing through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that the underlying debt will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated itself with what happened with the high-risk U.S. mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management to legally delineate the functions that graduates in Economics may be 30 years after it was approved in 1977, the Royal Decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the NCMV and will be able to provide its services for marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing data comparable in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information on which it is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed next December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has stated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy as compared to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped to more than 50% up to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, he collected a few record deposits over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of 100% of the money that the Government has offered and that it will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, which participates in three other companies, including its preferred to save it from the bankroute.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of May last Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the mayor, and who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
Agents continue to search the municipal and municipal premises of the Urban Council and the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours is not allowed.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was shot.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the MP's lawyer from the People's Party, Juan Morales was arrested by leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged filling of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight persons in detention.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and "Bono is among the best".
Moreover, he pointed out that "yes it seems" that La Manche's political man will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who issued his decision on 15 November not to take part in the next general elections and to abandon his political career in the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the Chamber into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only local in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know how to do" and he did not want to do as if he already occupied his position to not fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might regard as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to relentless persecution as well as the skeptics of its predictions as those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will have to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is to say, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individuals' accounts.
Until the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so cleverly dangerous in Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not require, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim that we move in bicycles or refresh ourselves with the range.
The mayor and chief of the local Totana Police arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the mayor's secretary and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where many officials met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and the Municipal Management Company of Sol Industriel and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Court of First Instance instructs.
The first six detainees were brought to justice today.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary party of PP, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A. were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine-pots would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Opérative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a highly known poultry company in the region, which could have played an intermediate role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 accommodation, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that had been reclassified and its project would assume to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the promotion of real estate; Conycasse, which manages the parkings of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us the comment of yesterday published in the most important newspaper in Finland (some in the head of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has brought public opinion to light as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the one imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the one imposed for the download (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the trafficking of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month-to-one-year sentence (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs would involve a six-month-to-two-year sentence
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on foreign research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted thanks to Tomographic Magnetic Resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the group responsible for the neurocognition images of the Institute Life & Bran, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when both individuals found that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Balkan Procurator
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla is angry with a bitter taste, because the leading leaders of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are in this list, whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the Carla' list (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who continues the criminals on the run and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible negative effects, implies an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the driver's driving licence, the civil condition, the type of vehicle to be secured or the use in fact, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is covered by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to be provided or the use in fact, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of disaster than in their care.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that the insurance provider, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when switching a contract with an insurance at an accessible price, such as low driving experience and the old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be secure is a risk insurance, other more economic options exist.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for any risk insurance with freeness, so that they get coverage from an insurance at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays some of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the loss paid by the customer will be established on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe, online insurance mediator in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third-party people, but for those caused by his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are a 25-year-old, try to be careful and avoid the damage to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the bonuses," Noguera says.
Beyond the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers when they enter into a contract with insurance, as the disaster rate is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance for all risks with freeness.
"Youth can't normally take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the European company director in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice' fear has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is best to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as persons with the lowest rate of disaster, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk-free insurance (which could be EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed drive and they have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, a risk-free insurance is preferable (in the case of EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance where the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that is most appropriate for us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighth finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow measure next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the league of the Champions, as it serves Italians to be first and the Scottishs to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that the Shaktar Donetsk, which has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not go ahead of it.
These two games of Group D will take place one week before the sixth day is over, as Milan AC will have to fight the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the end of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at their homes and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and will ensure a better cross in the eighths of finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not only be able to computer on this since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
For example, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of qualifying for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth finals to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that, although Benfica is last and without the opportunity to continue the European competition, she could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) reported shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stage in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people have exhausted tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the group that raged at the end of 1990 is told.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls came up on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
' Sporty Spice ' which is part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm on the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that with time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate it very much."
But a lot has changed since Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters were waiting for them.
They count on her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is alarming.
A heated dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risk of fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are driven by pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came after the Ukrainian and Gazprom government, a Russian-owned monopoly company providing gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine as it has agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," announced the Ukrainian Minister of the Economy, Anatoly Kinkh to Reuters Press Agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom's supplies for Ukraine.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its extra community employees to check for previous penalties, the oversight committee said.
The warning of the Rev.General, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer-general carried out checks on outside Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin in the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after being buried with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He was a member of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as he was suspected of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment controls on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer general's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Control of Previous Criminals, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on different countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information about the staff has been well verified, this is not done at all." the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment controls it would do itself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment controls currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities have reported that 1161 overseas workers, consisting of most doctors and nurses, have been employed.
However, the reviewer-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with the identification of staff with indeterminate contracts, which could choose to remain in our country or not.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for staff outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiastic about doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government associated with health committees would consider carefully the warnings contained in the report to be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including overseas persons.

Ray Winstonone, renowned for his coriander character interpretations, won the Richard Harris award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The fifty-year-old filmmaker, who has shot films like Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Crystal Crannel Kingdom.
Winstone stated that he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring in front of this great current actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury of stagemakers, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells operating an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smuggler cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on a oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper cites a statement by the Minister of the Interior, stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell led by a "Missile Launch Expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning against eight missile bands in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have concocted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shiite government allied to the United States, considered to be heretics according to the Sunny Saudis' harsh line.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by the appeals against the Saudi Government in the West, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five... months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on State television.
Among the detainees, 16 members of the Medine are organized into a "media cell" to promote "taffiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful andposted Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the militants.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data from the European vessel in orbit showed that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, air erosion due to solar radiation linked to a slower rotation has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a warm enough temperature surface to melt lead in it.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of the University of Oxford's Department of Physics Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, even with a habitable surface."
Uranium enriched by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Again open to everything
Mitt Romney stated that he was not a high candidate for the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another debate by You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, the questions and the answers have reflected a great deal about the conditions of the Republican party, who is a candidate for the next elections.
We do not know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the videos of You Tube to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard fun things: The board raised approval when the candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the lead of the important anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about clandestine immigration during his mandate as mayor in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of using illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when they were asked whether they would be prepared to promote an "amnesia" (provided the illegals with a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be thanks to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages the Republics to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water into the nose should be considered torture.
One stakeholder asked whether candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to be seen in a recent election in Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, to say that the death penalty is painful as much as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to go to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's uprising in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious quest for subsidies by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from the negator, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties are unable to agree to decide who is the most known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message on American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juridical.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra swedish foot finger.
But here's a revelation attesting that a rich businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went backwards in his election project, insulting British intelligence foolishly proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrible Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's purchase, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, demonstrated a failure of directives and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the Tax Code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative budget.
A retired trio of generals launched a revolt among the Lords, Protestant against the reduction of military expenditures: they proclaimed that they are the minister of defence, a part-time job for them.
Currently, the suspicion of crazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Workers (and his former Chief of the Guard) made them have to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is heading unmistakably toward the exit.
However, Governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government arrives in power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the ministers' offices are making the record; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast to be a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr Brown's decisions when he was a Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the funds of the party's "money counting for members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
Like Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies forever, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subsidisers of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, and also Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown has not been involved: Nothing suggests that he has been aware of these steps, even if most of the payments made have been made as a result of his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to use an investigation committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's the police's responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president for the Independent Committee of the Standards of Public Life, without leadership for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would require the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which might lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see swirling swimmers, circle around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit cards market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the shares of the unrecoverable balance sheet or more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvabilities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal banking resulted in an abrupt fall in banker archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions had to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct linkages between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate borrowing has disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; thus credit card debt would become a priority to repair everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with greater flexibility to such crisis conditions as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and reassess all borrowings." said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If the lower prices of the real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to the recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to dorsal swimmers..
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statements, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first found themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged collapse fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in the courthouse in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous all over Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding question for this investigation, which was launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 revealed to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, known as the "three of the Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to cheat on banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the bank of the subsidiary for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as interest to this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually these $20 million went to British bankers' pockets, from Fastow and others.
The charges indicated that the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracys in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured a six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of the payment of $1 million each, making them live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in banking in December 2001 after years of accountancy, could no longer hide his billion debt or even propose his biden speculations as profitable.
The collapse resulted in thousands of redundancies, over $60 billion market value loss and over $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been void because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not in, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs such seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires Salon, an orgy of incentives for consumption, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from yachts in a row to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer searched for a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"it's a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such Dallas"
"We experienced the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
Such as the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the largest global spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has $53 billion worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are generally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, that's why we're all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweller.
She participated in the trade fair for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Bijoutier Group of Soho.
“All women are well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare themselves as their clients, millionaires.
"I watched the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high-cut dress such as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems first of all aimed at the new wealthy, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to tail in the hoods to come up to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades are exposed, cans in platinium, Mövenpick ices, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund stuffed bears are exposed.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory factory's stand for the manufacture of Dutch Delf porcelain, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand made.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capitals (10-15 years are too much in line with Russian standards) have already passed out of striking logos to a kind of limited-edited brand that could not be sold at the trade fair.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are suffering from exposure every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of the King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold wires.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also claimed that he sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of brass leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in the prices of the real estate here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you'd already be millionaire, at least on paper, if it's not in question," he said.
"there are more than you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the Alliance Continental stand, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has set up four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers stopped to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr.Karyev.
Unauthorized surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the night before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the window bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observing an ambulance that just stopped at the door of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unaccredited cosmetic surgeon, whom the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they wait confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take some time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"it was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
McCarthy stated that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11 as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
"It is a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had come home about 15 hours.
And found Melle watering on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh was unable to confirm whether Melle Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical firm.
Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro's house where a fanned rose lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian poured down the back.
A blue canyon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in kitchen and for perfumes was lying in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bicycles all over the sides.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Department of Police, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate to the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"She said "you must be careful about this," he said.
"She was there when I came, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower the rates of global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, number 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets under way.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partially "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market late September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence was to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is prepared to inject new capital into US markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also made it possible to calm Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losers of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% reaching 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6 per cent and the French ACC40 took 2.3 per cent.
Previously, the re-appearance of credit difficulties in markets has been highlighted in response to the strong demand for a sale of monthly auctions of tri-funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject additional funds into the London financial markets resulting from credit tensions has led to high rates of three-month borrowing "Libor" to British banks, which have caused their highest growth since September last year, to 6.59% following a high rise since November 12.
England faces a call for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Selection Officers who was exceptionally there to help Peter Moores, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, to make his decision, and because the Office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national selectionr, at least in part-time.
The one who will not succeed in winning the #6 dosard will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also bad.
It is never easy to delete what allows a man to arrive at the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of ability.
There is only in cricket that selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubeby"; both new executives having good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless at least one chance is granted?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful rounds, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also fighting to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricket of the Test, and that despite the fact that his double cent marked against Australia in Australia could still be under estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the 88-year-old test in Bombay, 32 cents of the first class compared to six for Bopara, who at 22 years of age is seven younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his city of player of the Middlesex, and that, immediate rejection by the selectioners when Vaughan again in form, claims his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is very happy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently hit a 4x4 at a Volkswagen presentation, British sponsor.
He deferred only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well sur) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from a distance, to ask him if "had he seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his bright glow enables him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the real art of the selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spilling these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city had found normal.
Some came back to fight the militants who drove them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported to dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who came back by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, came in with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents the Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aid militia allowed him to hunt out Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back home.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he urged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back and fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the increasing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in view of continuing formation of well-armed "groups of citizens" and working with American military to defend their neighbours.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion expressed by all about the exile visas that Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit their entry into the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of death row squadrons.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been hunted out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State conducts vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest Federated State, by self-derived, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double or even triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in numbers above the average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the professional training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one out of five get their degree at a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Therefore, the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education has forced schools over a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests in the entire federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of crèche is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether the performance of students improves sustainably.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the rate of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other Federated States.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And in spite of sarrois, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise it might be possible to gain points in this area.
Because the neighbor’s language is compulsory in high school - even if the sarrois are not French.
Cávez arranges watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tic-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will remount the half-hour timer in the South American country.
Chavez in time becomes a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, the watches will be arranged at least four and a half hours of universal time as a result of a new law.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage-taking.
The Nationalist on the left announced that, as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not discuss relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "broken to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain too Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ringing in the country is furious: "Why don't you shut up" (because you don't care about it) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
She was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry at the constant demands of the populists on the left and who told her to shut up.
A reduction in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to one forecast, a true undervalue of the salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation of Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low growth in wages, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Research on Conjuncture in the journal "Bild".
New charges could also be made for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It was noted on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the rate of inflation at its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus explode at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to Cyprine's famous theory, the lightnings would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle stone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life had been there, it must have been at a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Vénus is perhaps the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which resembles the Earth so much in mass and dimension, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, since no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight Venus' singularity within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed to be on the front.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, a cloud turbollion at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the hemispheres of the Earth in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 terrian days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed itself on Earth as carbonate, it constitutes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the party's quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and I think the great coalition of closing the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor did not take her distances with the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows too," Köhler said.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the UDC ranks.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "provision policy" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only commissioned the Minister of German Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he tried to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also included other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the German Minister of Interior demanded.
Burned barricades, casseurs pulling on the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not form in our homes as well and that it breaks down into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" who appeared in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"Achieving the Summits of Integration at the Conferences on Islam, it already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems either from the point of view of urbanism or in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been engaged in serious street fights with the police during the last night.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater efforts to integrate the German government, that is what the President of the Turkish Communities was calling for in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "immission effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there is still a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than average.
First of all, more places for training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many youth from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must be careful anyway."
Young people should not be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter overflew the area with headlamps.
The authorities in office reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calmness.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announcing the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sundays.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopia scene entry of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and that there is nothing else to wait for from it.
Which country does this chancellor live in?
After his painful intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, he must say: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of concentrating too much on politics was pushed by Angela Merkel of a hard and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling in the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a policing politician, who fled into foreign politics and who even stayed there slowly.
For example, climate protection: in this area, it is still pleased and still about the Heiligendam agreements, but it does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of oneself - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it cramps with all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
This way she destroys her image of pragmatism, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the problems of internal policy are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this regard, the number of times it lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starters to pronounce a sentence of half specific.
She lies in unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican candidates for the presidential election, both Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The pressure of candidates is already on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestines", blames Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The one against him with heavy reproach: "I would say his own house was a haven for clandestines" answered Giuliani and blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are going to attack: since the Republican base has no official favors, the eight candidates for the presidential office are primarily using discussions on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and debate on torture is seen in the reactions of St. Petersburg's joint hall in Florida.
If conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, the applauses will defer in the auditorium.
This is where they are once again where the weaknesses of the two favors reside.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney explains, "and presents his apologies to the base and television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, went to a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on the Bible's literary interpretations.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilians.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armies, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of military rule end.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his position as Chief of the Armed Forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus relied on international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing the post of Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and of the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decided on 3 November.
Soon after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with jurists of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four others injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The German supergroups of the 1960s are happy: the three members of the Harmonia Group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" appeared.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the poster of the evening.
Everyone's got his little box in front of him, his cable, and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, middle throne in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked on the left of Michael Rother, 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, is curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes this is added inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen too much themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again assured some emotions among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasoned in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case as long as it lasts for this group to be so painfully lacking for 32 years.
But why wouldn't the German have the right to celebrate his living legends in the 1970s?
All the more so than what is dubiously called "Krautrock" has always been better in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo award to the survivors of Cologne Can's group for their work, we saw the German pop faces questioning in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pagan praise, the astonishment was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was jumping on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in oneself and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Roth had recently settled in Kraftwerk and finally became a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Roth was followed by Cluster musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th century ruins, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideologically than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called there was in the trash a fan of choral Harmony Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmony far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmony", and the following "De Luxe".
Because also serene and moderate as music sounded, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood wasn't for himself to seek.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griesm in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother, at that time, wished to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Roth landed in the spheres of esotericism and made his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster relives in the 1990s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album of Griesm to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Snow! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the World's Culture House in Berlin.
Publicly funded under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's sentence is set in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar wired tools are used for the formation of the legend.
In front of that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by gluering microphones to the organ and battery, to shoot the instruments from the dead thanks to the instruments with effects built themselves.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
All three of them in great technical recorders.
At that very moment, the house choir will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been rocky.
The roots were less searched in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68" is not totally wrong, and also Harmonia is now no longer irritated by it.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
It can tap on someone's nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Death Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of senseless fires or on the contrary they are too teary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: of course the criminals of war Karadzic and Mladic always hide in the Balkans mountains, but it is precisely there, in the darkest back country of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
In the last place we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many gentle and fullish roles in women's feelings films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have pleased him to show themselves.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter gets chased (why today's films should be as long and confusing as collective locomotive drivers' conventions?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of eye-clips: deep down, his character as a war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not as kind: a man who has long had his best moments behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this attraction, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Material Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless suite of movies missed on the Balkan War.
From "murderal peace" we can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar francs, in which one of them falls soon in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs here are not presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a TV is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of senseless shootings.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there was never a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the fox", could have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories look like strikingly: two males go on small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the lost cynic with a heart, as presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must assign it to him to add to a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, manages to ensure that NATO, the CIA and all the world's first hunters have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be brought before the Hague International Court.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and he suspects the Americans and the French (where they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive the hunt in a rather intensive way due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem of Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compare, I see the veins of the inflated forehead, clearly: as it is tiring to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were of major flops.
We can add that there have never been good films in South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis home or a field of mines, he goes out with "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go to Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good film on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still need to mature - those who today hold classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were never celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today as simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hectomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it pleased the screenwriters with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" actually became as good as either because Lubtisch and Chaplin still did not know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we shouldn't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic artistic look and distance from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That is only because certain things never change."
"The big cities will always be awfully dangerous, the men will always be assassinated in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The take-off of the mayor with the Hamburg candidacy for the Summer Olympics has been a challenge in politics and the economy to critical virulents.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the Olympiads idea.
"Without this objective, political-sportal momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained in his previous statements on Wednesday, according to which the Olympic ambitions in Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, about Munich's candidacy for winter games in 2018.
This preference means to us that, in the time period we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, says Von Beust.
The Sports Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be further in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's candidacy at the University of 2015 as being "not a substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of higher schools in sport had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for the Small Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The nomination for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 would have raised a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' crates.
The one that connects the concepts of Sweden and the wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today results in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is shrouded, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden caisses, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soapboards.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - of hundreds of boxes made of boarded Brillo: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo card factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden cassettes that at the time would enter law into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached sales at auctions of more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed that about one hundred wooden caisses had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then give it up.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief conservative of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, among which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and inserted, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals instead that the paint has been directly applied without background on the stratified panels, using a paint roll - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These caisses have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come from another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six caisses in its collection as copies/materials of exhibition."
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "our charges" that will be raised in the case of soap crates in powder.
But since we've been out there with an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who criticized the President for corruption and election fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power had recently attacked the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to an attempt by putsch missing in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the hearing to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 supporters.
Military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted them and joined in their mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyally powerful troops are closing the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Council.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the actions of soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command of the Ranger Scouts elite unit, said other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption for months.
The Manila district of finance has already been the theatre of the mutiny attempt by about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke down about 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts to putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured more than 20 per cent participation in the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company reported on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a purchase before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, efforts are being made to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has been communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would only have the money for a third party, we report on the market.
Last night, United Internet had already acquired close to 10 percent participation in the mobile company Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed in the Stock Exchange 17.4 million new shares worth € 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson from United Internet.
Both companies founded the company in MSP participation in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to dock 18.49 percent more at Freenet, United Internet Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all the options open, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet SA, we have learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The yet unforeseeable poker on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch had so far a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent more.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
