The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led, according to the first interim results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Socio-Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006, however, it loses 5.5%.
Even worse has gone for ÖVP, which loses almost 9% of the votes with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the post-war period and above all the literally catastrophic result of the populace, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them because they caused the government to sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) have gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% in votes - but the socio-democratics have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populists have agreed to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 separated from the BZÖ) which was even the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution clearly plays Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
The Green Party was also able to enter Parliament, but it fell slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has clearly exceeded the threshold of 4% and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India Can Cool
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York following today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it did not resolve, then it would be , that there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly get in the way of legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the accusation and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Court of First Instance then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is to give the convicted the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been going on with India for many years.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a deep mistake in the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained the promise to deal with it from the Indian side.
"I've got relatively many promises," he only found.
A Czech judge in the battle for seabeds
It is close to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adds something.
Dominate the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a world of little known natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms so far that they bring within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states began to interest the submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they enjoy the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive right over all resources of the continental shelf.
"In a few words by continental platform you mean that part of seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request before the Committee on the Definition of the Dimensions of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and costly measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional aid.
The committee has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to you by the committee last week, about 1.6 square kilometers, so about six times as large as the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear him in the future from the seabeds, as they are promised will be invaluable.
Other states too will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins."
No one has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, saying, "with the fact that his individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If you share it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "Pioneer Investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker in the division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had called for aid from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is available on the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages that have been seized.
On the rescue operation mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the military specialists, GSG9 units, the avian federal police, the federal criminal office, as well as logistics experts from the technical institution were present on site.
As the spokesman of the ministries announced on Monday night, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join them as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get lucky," says an internal ministry spokesman.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travellers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It did not explain the release details.
There was no information in Berlin, by the time they were back in Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American House of Representation rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress has just failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 items around 227 the US representative house rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties there had not been a majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been settled.
In a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to persuade critics with the heavy 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was under way, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, it collapsed again.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the benefit of both the House of Members and the Senate.
Promoters record figures increasing bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study the turnover on travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year has obviously increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite the weak sights of the conjuncture, the desire to travel Germans during an investigation remains firm.
On reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a 31 % turnover plus the same period of the previous year , as the German Association for Tourism DRV reported on Monday in Berlin .
According to the survey of the GfK market search institute, there are already increased booking rates for autumn months.
Therefore, the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be approximately 11%, the DRV reported.
The figures for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar price, in particular, they would be travel to the United States, DrV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly requested to travel to the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as to the Germans.
Most of the trips included have a high quote, explained the president of the Drv Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individual organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, booking discounts made in advance or offers with everything included, explained Laepple.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would again be a turnover surplus - although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, bottled beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln grilled.
A debut in Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing is common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers are already launching against us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how friends get there
The two-money Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident in the north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/clothing so far remains within the limits.
And on the other hand, when you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monk tells me that I would have tied the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, at the center six virgins, on the right you are busy, behind the widow."
Suddenly I fix my bow from behind to left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of thin flirting techniques and wear extra felt hats, on which heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and pull the bare finger against one uninvited.
The boy with showy inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a torn "oooooo".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a litre before.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, of which everyone thinks it's a skating pan.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At 8 p.m., the public health workers walk on the square of the feast, who must take care of the poor beons.
Nurses show up in white every time – always 4 at the same time drag a tent-covered barrel into the tent.
This works as with most visitors of the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the curtain in this blood-alcoholic bar, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," screams one of the toilets and disappears in the baronda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly afterward.
After the accident a 51-year-old man was arrested with a lack of driving charge.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at once, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway running in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany sank during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the ice borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominating forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a munitions train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone out of the way, far out of history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, need - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-largest diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the ice borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the car bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of AKP's main foreign policy experts, Turkish deputy Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a skirmish race along the tracks that produced the old world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn their backs on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary movement in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the general district of AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centres and power pastries, where managers in business-completes - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its territory.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point, "I ask, "Will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out that almost everyone I spoke to here has recited in memory: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as much as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentleman Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle-Eastern ambitions can now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I'm waiting at the terminal for the ferry that brings me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At the same time, there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent it was supposed to advance on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11th) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21, but at the time Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changeable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that music presented to do, both Madrid and Messiaen, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young chorus was often amazing, always exciting, and was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often it was told by Tod to "let music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowered.
Whatever the music standard was, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint an orchestra director, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have been looking at more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "carried around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25th) specifies that "in 1946 he began studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... at the same time studying for a degree in science, a letter and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vita", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, although treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda Supersales
In November Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great inhabitability, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
A refined mechanic, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel, should be added to everything.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Jazz Honda.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth pointing out an innovative design, a new platform, larger size and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the first generation market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
It is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan alone, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda . to reduce sales decrease to good measure in Spain.
In fact, the company's managers plan to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% decrease.
Despite the increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts the arrival of another model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation to companies in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1.69 meters more (two centimeters more) and the difference is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in size, it also expands the living space.
This advantage stems from the introduction of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage – equipped with double background – rises to 399 liters, i.e., 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of version 1.4 of the engine, and that the baggage capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, motors in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with a fuel engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time maintain high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cv to 6,000 laps with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 spins.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, they are now available 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reaches a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Safety Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the producing house.
During the flight, each water creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important thing is bees' compound eyes, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they defined as a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles in front of BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents the collision.
"At the moment that a barrier is detected, the little robot imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction turning on the wheels at the right corner or higher to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serial in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to target by avoiding obstacles in the path.
Wrestle before borrowing
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, in addition to having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing themselves to money laundering in banks with doubt of insolvency, they have created a fun and informative game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Bad Credit Hotel" or problems.
The fourth aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce thinking not one, but two or even three times before requesting a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but is little detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the vast public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a sound room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share of 21% of participation in the Company, received as a result of a net decrease in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
A week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shareholdings at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The fixed price shall be less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be made on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars, or a percentage below its current course of 28%.
By 1700, though, Morgan Stanley was down from 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley into bank holding company," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow them to differentiate their actions, however, by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than it previously did.
Monday's modalities also show that in the last days the agreement was modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for an amount of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our participation share would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, over a given period, the latter will be exchanged more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow her to take investment opportunities, strengthen her budget and increase her liquidity.
A spokesperson from the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a solvency coefficient Tier One equal to about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has specified that she has "clearly" lightened her budget since the end of August.
The last few weeks have tested the group, which has seen half the value of its shares, while the cost of the risk insurance has been impenetred.
However, it declined on Monday and remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "surprising" among Wall Street's large investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's detection, announced that he earned $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the project of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on 80% votes.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should obtain half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the election seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a crushing victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did her Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that essentially lives from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who may be elected for two consecutive terms of office of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to reintroduce its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free of charge, which the president has begun to promote in this country 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were brought back on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commander.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo's international airport, around 15 and 30, on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to release any press interviews, to the Maadi hospital, a residential periphery of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and have not been paid any ransom "to the kidnappers", said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garana on the landing track.
Raised on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been hounded from one hiding to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egyptus, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault at night, shortly before dawn.
"There have been gunshots, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have escaped," said the responsible who asked to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were found and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two of them.
According to the army the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the front page, a debate on the financing of culture focused on the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life remains in the shadow.
Who will pronounce to denounce the poor amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that starve?
Which policy will dare to remind the federal government that is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our neighbours, it is the Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 societies to safeguard historical, family heritage, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is them who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which has ended up in difficulty for the first time in Europe for the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest even in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in the weekend agreed at the highest level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions made in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision made Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institution's crisis had then appeared in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
Bank shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current share prices, the group's entire capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to bank managers this value is not real.
The company summit is responsible for the collapse of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not be afraid of losing their money.
Among the bank's clients there was no panic, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America life and health insurers, on the basis of people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting chicken to fox" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall pay the insurance fee and the amount to be charged in the event of health claims to the health status of the customer and if they consider the risk too high do not provide the insurance.
The client had to undergo a medical visit some time ago and the contract was concluded only after the examination was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer identification code you can easily have information from the pharmacies about which medicine you bought in the last year and half and from that the evince program of which diseases you suffer and under what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice invariably high and is classified as the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the programme on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, therefore the insurer in addition to paperwork does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the opposite are that some medicines are usable for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraine or heat pumps, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is worth as a risk increase factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, companies were formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, require the patient's approval.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so even if so far they have not imposed fines on negligence.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and parallel control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives control authorities competence to specialized data service companies.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the data to the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not conclude the contract.
So at the end the hens are entrusted to the mercy of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly each other, the agenda for the ninth meeting at the summit has been dominated by this theme, as well as all the other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue at the ninth meeting held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to doubling in five years, i.e. to increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been legally unified, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India by the end of 2009 would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused attention on global events.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it has continued in the energy and climate programme, that is, it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today will be in the French capital where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission worth EUR 20 billion.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair awaits this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in Buchmesse’s 5.0 pavilion: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books is gradually reduced over the total of Italian production, particularly for adults and boys.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane were found, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying into the Nevada desert.
Rutams were found on an altitude of 3,000 metres above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Within the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was given for death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the sighting of the wreck, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered from 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been discovered by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents called Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a hat.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had been around the world in airplanes and without stairs.
Among its many records, including that of flying at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemas with an original design and well defined by decided lines, large surfaces and net corners.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "comatti" offroads of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a brand new in this sector.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next 17 October.
Thus the advertising beat that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affixions, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the very central shopping route of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car exits the manifesto.
Later, through the use of innovative lighting technology8 the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of motor communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stun the interests of future buyers? We will see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
Of the Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls whose entire Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National for years and that until now, for the truth, had never created too many problems.
He wasn't even opposed to opposing typhosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia there were groups (little units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the towns of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed to not be identified.
They're inspired by English typhoid.
In Bulgaria, they found a true Nazi hoard, the one in Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all names, therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo running, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had previous stage crimes, had been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
The Viminal now expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disturbances.
An international Daspo that prevents attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, won't set foot in a stage anymore.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulsion: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, they add others.
"We must immediately put an end to this fire and not legitimize those who behave this way," they say by Viminal.
So, "look wide open especially in view of the National game on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Apulia there is a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Cass, which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which deals with the very problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm weaved during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it's not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli, who for a few weeks has been director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazelli had previously been this of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to drown the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact happens.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see well what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about baits at Mameli's hymn: even those that are not a crime, but if you allow me, they're not education...".
