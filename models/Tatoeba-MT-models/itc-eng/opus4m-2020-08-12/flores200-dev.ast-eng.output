The presence of black girls on the base of the mountain has been reported not to match the volcanic activity of the mountain.
The girls presented the possibility that there would really be an eruption.
The moon brought between 120 and 160 cubic metres of onboard fuel when it came and was driven by strong winds and leaves against the rubble.
The helicopters rescued the twelve crew members and the only failure was a broken nose.
The ship of 100 meters long needed its path to collect its usual load of fertilizer and at the start of the boat, officials feared that the ship could make a raid.
The reform proposes that both cameras be approved in 2011.
There was a change in this legislative session when they removed the second sentence, first in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban civil unions between people of the same sex, could open the door to future civil unions.
According to the procedure, the new camera selected in 2015 or 2016 will review HJR-3 again to continue the process.
Vautier, apart from driving, made a hunger strike in 1973 against what he considered to be political censorship.
He changed the French law. His activism came from when, at the age of 15, he joined the French Resistance during World War II.

Karno is a well-known and controversial English teacher who enrolled in Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have had a total of 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In his notes he used words that some parents consider rude, and according to reports he used bad words in class.
Modern Education accused him of putting big ads on buses without permission and of lying saying he was the main tutor of English.
He had also been previously accused of copyright violations, but he had no charges.
One former student said that he "spoken at school, learned to tie notes and was like a student's colleague."
In the last three decades, though officially still a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic power has multiplied its value 90 times.
For the first time in China, China exported more cars than Germany and outnumbered the US as the industry's largest market.
China's GDP may be greater than that of the United States in two decades.
The tropical storm Danielle, the fourth known storm of the 2010 hurricane season, was formed in the east of the Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which is found about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, brings sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h)
Scientists at the Foracan National Center predict that Danielle will seize strength and become a hurricane on Wednesday.
It is still necessary for the storm to touch the earth and it is difficult to calculate the potential damage in the United States or the Caribbean.
He was born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek became famous for playing for the Belgrade Partisan.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time with the computer, he scored 403 goals in 468 shares.
No one played as many games or scored more goals with the computer as Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted as the best player in the history of the Partizan.
The celebrations began with a special spectacle of the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
He was followed by the performances of the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, an Ottoman military band and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.

Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw macabre scenes trying people to break windows in order to get out.
There were people hitting the crystals with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the crystals broke down at last, and they started going out the window," said survivor Fanciszek Kowal.
Stars give light and heat to the energy that they energy when hydrogen atoms merge into other heavier elements.
Researchers are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a peripheral problem of solving and it's been a long time since we've seen useful fusion reactors.
The needle at the sky floats over the water for the surface tension.
The surface tension is produced because the molecules on the surface of the water attract more to each other than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water that allows things like an needle to float on it.
The modern skate blade has a double thread with a concave middle slot. The two threads make the gel better hold on to, until it is won by a side.
Because the lower part of the blade is curved, the lower part of the blade is bent one side or another, the thread that is in contact with the gel is also curved.
This causes the skater to turn, if the skaters lean to the right, the skater will lean to the right, if they do it to the left, the skater will turn to the left.
To return to your previous level of energy, you need to get rid of the extra energy that was extracted from the light.
This is done by issuing a small particle of light called photon.
Scientists call this process "radiation-stimulated emission" because atoms are stimulated with light, which causes the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The following illustration shows how atoms emit photons. From below, actually photons are much smaller than those of the drawing.
The photons are even smaller than the matter of what atoms are made!
After hundreds of hours of use, the queue ends and the light bulb stops working.
The light bulb needs replacement. You need to set the search when changing it.
First, you have to turn off the lamp or disconnect its cable.
This is because the electrical plug where the metallic part of the bulb is connected can stick a good calame if you touch the plug or the metal part while it is partially plugged in.
The largest organ of the circulatory apparatus is the heart, which is to change the blood.
The blood comes from the heart for tubes called arteries and comes back for others called veins. The finest are called capillaries.
Triceratops' teeth may hurt not only leaves, but also strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops eat cicadas, which is a type of common plant in Crete.
These plants are like small palm trees with a glass of sharpened leaf and with scales.
Triceratops may use their strong pitch to peel the sheets before eating the kill.
Other scientists say that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that they will be eaten by any dinosaur; today galbanians and other animals such as parrots (that descend from dinosaurs) can eat leaves or poisonous fruits.
How would I get rid of the gravity of Io? If you had on the surface of Io, you would have weighed less than you weigh on the earth.
A person who weighs 200 books (90 k) on Earth will weigh about 36 books (16 k) on Earth. So gravity, of course, takes less from you.
The sun does not have a selection like the Earth to go on. It is integer made of gas, fire, and plasma.
The gas is made further to the distance from the center of the Sun.
The outer part we see when looking at the Sun is called the photosphere, which literally means "the golden ball."
About three years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, like the Moon.
The phases are produced because only the side of Venus (or the moon) that gives the Sun receives light. Venus' phases support Copernicus' theory that planets turn around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a traffic of Venus.
England lived a long period of peace after the reconquering of Danelaw.
However, in 991 Etelredu had to face a Viking fleet greater than anything since the time of Guthrum, a century earlier.
This fleet led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who was going to free his country from Danish domination.
Following a number of military setbacks, Etelredu reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway with the intention of claiming the throne, which I did with unequal results.
Hangul is the only dated alphabet for popular and daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 while King Sejong's reign (1418–1450).
Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most admired.
Originally called the alphabet Hangul alphabet Hunminjeongeum, which means "correct sounds for people's instruction."
There are good theories about how the Sanskrit began. One of them is about air migration from west to India that took its language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The first book in the known world is written in Sanskrit. After a compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit was lost in hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that has served as a basis for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the basis of European languages such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the war in France, Germany began to prepare to invade Britain.
Germany attacked the key name "Operation Sea Lion." Most of the British army's weapons and supplies will be lost in the evacuation of Dunquerque, so they were very weak.
But the Royal Navy was much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet that was sent through the Canal.
Even so, a few British Royal Navy ships were based near the likely routes of the invasion, charging the admirals with the possibility of merging them with German air raids.
We started by explaining the plans of Italy. Italy was basically the sister of Germany and Japan.
They had an army and a weaker army, even though they had just made four new ships just before the war started.
Italy's main goal is African countries. In order to control these countries they needed a launch so that troops could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
Because of it, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to those actions, Italian warships had nothing more to do.
Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
submarines are ships designed to travel under water and there are a great deal of time left.
The submarines were used in World War I and World War II.
At the beginning of the war, they moved through the marine surface, but when the radars developed and perfected, the submarines had to be submerged in order not to be detected.
German submarines are called U-Boats. German submarines are suitable for navigation and handling their own submarines.
Because of their success with the submarines, after the war the Germans are not allowed to have many.
Yes, Pharaoh Tutancamón, sometimes called "Tut Pharaoh" or "Pharaoh child", is one of the most familiar Pharaohs of ancient Egypt in the modern age.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in the old domain and was not registered in most of the kings lists.
However, the discovery of this tomb in 1922 made it famous. Although many ancient tombs were stolen, this tomb was virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutancamón are kept, including thousands of artifacts made with precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the streets with radios made the Assyrian cars lighter, faster and better prepared to leave behind the soldiers and other cars.
The deadly bullets arrows could hang the armor of the enemy soldiers. About 1000 C.E. the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights horses. The horse chair had not been invented yet, so the Assyrian cavalry was fighting over the naked wolf of its horses.
We know many politicians, scientists and Greek artists. Probably, the best known person in this culture is Homero, the legendary Greek poet, who composed two master works of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristotle are still popular dramatists and their works are considered among the best in universal literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematical Pythagorean, known above for its famous theorem about the relationships between the sides of the rectangles.
There are miscalculations of how many people speak Hindi, believe it's between the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers changes depending on whether true dialects are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people understand it.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but not in writing; both languages can be understood in daily conversations.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia had a lot of German cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to have God to the native people, so they invented the literary Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet and added the graph "Õ/õ".
With the passage of time, many German loans were converged. This marked the beginning of the illustration.
According to tradition, the inheritance of the throne would have military formation only to finish the studies.
However, Charles graduated from university studies at the Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and, later, history; he graduated at 2:2 (a smaller degree).
Carlos was the first member of the British royal family to achieve a title.
European Turkey (Eastern or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey has more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are in South-West Asia and 23,764 square miles (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey's surface makes it the 37th largest country in the world; it has the combined size of continental France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is surrounded by sea in three parts: the Exeu sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north, and the Mediterranean sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Part of the current Belgian territory was part of Luxembourg in the past, but it became Belgian with the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg always tried to keep itself as a neutral country, but Germany occupied it both in World War I and in World War II.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fortress in ruins and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrug Ngawang Namgyel created him to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-mongoles forces.
In 1951 a fire forgave a few remains of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the sculpture of Zhabdrug Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress remained and protected, keeping itself as one of Bhutan's most fabulous attractions.
While the 18th century Cambodia saw fit between two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.

Learning to make interactive media involves both conventional and traditional skills and skills learned in interactive classes (write scripts, edit video and audio, talk, etc.)
The precise interactive design of the re-evaluation of our assumed ideas, not just five to production and we learn to think in non-linear ways.
The interactive design is rich where the components of a project are connected between them, but it also feels like a separate entity.
The problem with zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements needed to achieve a list of focal lengths are much greater than for fixed targets.
This has less incidence because lens manufacturers are improving standards in production.
This allowed the magnifying glasses to take photos of a quality comparable to that reached by lenses with a fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of magnification lenses is that the maximum aperture or speed of the lens is lower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems with converting a movie to DVD is over-scan.
Most televisions are set to please the general public.
That's why everything you see on TV has the edges cut, the ones on top, the ones on the bottom and the ones on the sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. What is called overrides.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the most likely edge is also cut and if the video has too many subtitles near the edge, they will not be fully seen.
The traditional medieval castle inspired a great deal of imagination, conjuring images of justice, lakes and arthuric cavalry.
Until the ruins of the millennia remain, it is easy to bring to mind the sound and the sounds of the old battles, almost to hear the noise of the helmets in the backyards and to empty the fear rising from the dungeons.
But, to our reality-based imagination, why were the castles built? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe Castle, typical of the period, is more fortified than completely castle.
Your large windows of crystal and fine walls would not withstand several attacks for a long time.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was in no relative peace and the defense was no longer necessary but against small gangs of thieves.
The equality of power was a system in which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all states on the continent.
The idea was that all European nations would try to prevent any nation from becoming powerful and poro, national governments would often change their alliances to keep the balance.
The Spanish War of Socience was the first war in which the central theme was the balance of power.
This meant an important exchange, because the European powers would no longer have the claim of religious conflict. So, the war of the Thirty Years was the last war on religious issues.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on June 21, 356 C.E., but not intended by Erastratus.
According to the narration, its motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, offended, announced that the name Erostra should never be mentioned.
The Greek historian Estrabón later noted his name, that is why we know of him now. The temple was destroyed the same night in which Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the reconstruction, but they denied him. After Alexander died in 323 C.E., the temple was rebuilt.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while giving the notes well; also avoids the extra movements of the gods.
In this way, you will get as tired as possible, remember that you don't need to hit the keys with much force in order to get more volume as it does in the plane.
In accordion, to have more volume, use the sheets with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for communion, identity or consciousness of a last reality, a divinity, a spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or vision of divine reality/debate or lay them.
Trackers are searching for certain life forms or practices that feed those hopes.
Mysticism trembles at other forms of religious belief and at the same time at the direct personal experience of a single state of consciousness, in particular at keeping oneself, at ease, at ease, or at the same time euphoric.
Sikhismu is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It came into the Panyab region in the 15th century of a sectarian decade inside the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a different religion of Hinduism even though they recognize Hindu roots and turns.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Panyabi means "the path of the Guru". Guru is a fundamental figure in all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has become so important that it is the glue of Sikh's beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by the Nanak guru (1469-1539). It was continued in succession by nine more gorus.
Even so, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test by becoming Polish riots, which the workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, in a general protest against the communism.

The civilization of the Indo Valley was a civilization of the bronze age in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent which included most of the present-day Pakistan and some regions of north-west India and northern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourishes in the basin of the Indu river, from which its name comes.
Even some scholars fish that, when civilization also exists in the basins of the river, today's dry river, Sarasvati, should be called Indo-Sarasvati civilization. Others call it Harapana civilization, by Harappa, the first laying that happened in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire helped the development of medical advances.
Emperor Augustus gathered the first doctors and formed the first Roman Medical Corps to be used after the battles.
The surgeons had knowledge of some sedatives that included morphine, ampola grain extracts, and scapolamine, belenberry grain.
They were smart to amputate to save patients with gangrene, in addition to tourniquets and blood clips to control the blood flow.
Throughout many centuries, the Roman Empire had the great advances in the mechanics that arrived until today and are the basis of what we know.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that can only be done once in a while; more complex duplicates such as the inverse fold are not allowed, and all folds must have a clear location.
It was developed by John Smith in the '70s to help inexperienced practitioners or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop a sense of race and racial stereotypes of good young people, and this affects their behavior.
Also, children of racial minorities with low-educational stereotypes tend to not do so well in classrooms after learning of the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and has up to 54 million profiles today.
These websites have called for a lot of attention, especially in the educational field.
These websites have positive aspects, including those that are the facility to develop a class page where blogs, videos, photos and other elements can be included.
You can easily access this page by providing a web site, which makes it easy to remember and write to students who have keyboard or spelling problems.
It can be customized so that it is easy to read and it has as many colors as we want.
The attention deficit disorder "is a neurological syndrome and the classic definition of its characteristic symptoms includes impulsiveness, distraction, hyperactivity and excess energy."
It's not an intellectual disability, it's a learning disorder; it's "affects 3 out of 5 children, maybe it reaches 2 million in the US."
Children with ADHD have problems focusing on their duties, but they can do it with things they lend, like playing video games, watching cartoons, or writing punctuation phrases.
These children get involved in many problems because "they participate in risk behaviors, get entangled and question authority" to stimulate their brain, which cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
TDA affects relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why they do what they do or why they write how they write, unless their level of maturity is changed.
By changing the ability to gain knowledge and to learn, in the way mentioned above, the basic rate at which knowledge was acquired changed.
The method of obtaining information was extreme. The pressure was no longer in individual memory, but the ability to remember texts became an approach.
In essence, the Renaissance significantly changed the approach of learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids do not use hand to move, load weight or sleep by trees.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzees are similar in size and length, although the hand carries the weight on the knots on the floor.
Human hand is shorter than foot, with sharper phalanxes.
Hand fossils from two to three million years old reveal this change in the specialization of the hand of the placemotion to manipulation.
Some people think that experiencing many lucid dreams can often be tired.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of bright dreams, broadening the duration of time between REM states.
With fewer REMs per night, this state in which real sleep experiences and your body recovers becomes as frequent as if it were a problem.
This is as tired as getting up every twenty- thirty minutes and watching television.
The effect depends on the frequency per night when your brain tries to blush lucidly.
Things didn't go well with the Italians in North Africa almost since the beginning. In the week that they declared the war, on 10 June 1940, the 11th squadron of British Husbands stationed Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the engineer-in-chief of the tenth army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor General of Libya and supposedly Mussolini's successor, was killed by being friends while landing at Tobruc.

Maybe the most common type of tourism is what people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is too different from their everyday lives to relax and enjoy themselves.
Sanders, theme parks and campins are the places the ociu tourists say to.
When the purpose of our visit to a particular site is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit some designated places in a particular country or choose to focus on a particular area.
Colonials, in view of their activity, also asked for reinforcements.
Repents the troops strengthening the front positions for the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regimes with 200 men, under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both became general later).
Stark's men were positioned along the valley in the northern end of the position occupied by the settlers.
When the tide opened down a gap along the Mystic River on the north side of the peninsula, they widened the valley with a low stone wall heading north, finishing it on the water's edge on a small beach.
Well Gridley well Stark placed a post about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered it not to be shot until the regular soldiers passed it.
The American plan was trusted to launch coordinated attacks from three different positions.
General John Cadwalder launched a distraction attack against the British garrison in Bordentown, to cut off any reinforcement.
General James Ewing had to cross with 700 militiamen the noise at Trenton Ferry, take the bridge on Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main force of assault, made up of 2,400 soldiers, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then extended into two groups, one under the command of Greene and the other under Sullivan, with the intention of launching an attack first that dawn.
When quarter of a mile for half a mile is changed, speed becomes much less important and resistance is paramount.
Since after which a runner running half a mile in less than two seconds is fast, it must develop resistance.
Running through the winter camp, in addition to telling the gymnasium to strengthen the body's top, is the best race season preparation.
Proper nutritional standards do not guarantee elite performance, but they can affect the overall health of young sportsmen.
Maintaining energy balance, hydrating well and understanding the various aspects of supplementation can contribute to the improvement of its performance and increase the enjoyment of practice.
Running medium distances is a relatively cheap sport; however, there is much confusion over the small equipment needed for this.
Products may be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no impact on yield.
Athletes can prefer a product even if they don't give them real benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental foundations of any matter.
It is a complex entity, consisting of, chords with the simplified Bohr model, in a core orbiting electrons, in some other mode similar to the planets orbiting the sun – see Figure 1.1.
The kernel is made of two particles — neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge. electrons have a negative electric charge.
To see the victim, you first check the scene to ensure your safety.
You have to stick to the victim's position when you lie down and watch any warning signals automatically.
If you miss trying to help, I think the only thing you do is make it worse.
The study showed that depression, lightness, and catastrophic thinking mediate the relationship between pain and inability in people with lumbar pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking, not depression, and brightness were conditions for weekly PA sessions.
Those who participate in regular activities need more support in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing differences between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort from normal physical movement.
The view, or the ability to see, depends on our visual system sensors or our eyes.
There are many different eye constructions that vary in complexity depending on the body's needs.
Different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wave frequencies and have different degrees of sharpness. In addition, they need different processes to understand the input and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is a set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographic area.
When all individuals in a population are identical in relation to a particular phenotype, they are known as monomorphics.
When subjects show several variants of a phenotype they are polymorphic.
Also the colonies of ants of warriors march and go in extreme phases.
In the nomadic phase the ant armies marches at night and stop to camp for the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the food available is reduced. At this stage, the colony makes temporal negroes that change each day.
Pipe of these nomadic shares or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cell" which means "small room" and uses it for the first time as a researcher observing the structure of the corchu.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms make up one or more cells
Actually, cells are so basic and important for the study of life, that you often call them "the thieves of life."
The nervous system maintains the homeostasis by sending nerve impulses across the body to keep the blood flow properly and smoothly.

Many people are dreaming about the day when humans will be able to tell another star and explore other worlds. They wonder what's out there, how many people think there are aliens or other lives on other planets.
But if this happens again, it probably won't be long. Stars are so distributed that there are trillions of thousands between stars that are "neighbor".
Maybe one day your grandchildren come to an alien-life planet and question their sources.
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat things and tell them inside. Most animals can move.
Animals also have brains (though they don't have all their animals; water, for example, doesn't have them).
The animals meet for the whole Earth. They fly on earth, swim in the oceans and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional drive of organisms.
Cell comes from the Latin word cell, which means small room.
If you look at a living being with a microscope, you'll see that they're made of squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small quadrins in the corchu with a microscope.
It was the first person to see dead cells.
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen has been gassed with the same properties as liquid nitrogen. Liquid state is more dense but molecules are identical.
Water is another example. The water compound is formed by two atoms of hydrogen and one oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure as gaseous, liquid or solid state.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains.
The time is something that turns me around and affects everything we do. However, it is hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experiment time as a series of events covering the future, the present and the past.
Time is also the way we compare duration of events.
You can watch the passage of time yourself while observing the repetition of a cyclic phenomenon. A cyclic phenomenon is something that happens over and over again.

Most of the 19th and 20th centuries thought that Maori were the first inhabitants of New Zealand; they hunted giant birds, moes.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and brought New Zealand from the Morori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moreiri were a group of Maori from the continent who emigrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own peaceful culture.
I also have another tribe in the islands of Chatham of Maori origin than to emigrate from New Zealand.
They were called Morori, there were several moors and eventually they removed the Morori.

By listening to people sharing their individual, family and organizational stories, we welcome a valuable vision of the past and some of the personalities that influenced, for good or bad, the culture of the organization.
Even knowing his own history doesn't mean understanding his own culture, it makes people aware of what part of the organization they are.
While verifying the outcome and realizing the errors, individuals and all persons who participate better discover the values, missions and what moves the organization.
In this way, remembering previous examples of starting behavior and the resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and directions for the local island.
These success stories have reduced fear of change, creating positive inclinations to change in the future.
The converged thought patterns are technical for solving problems which include different ideas or fields to find a solution.
The goal of this position is speed, logic and precision, in addition to identifying facts, applying existing techniques, and finding information.
The most important thing about this mentality is that there is only one possible answer. Just think of two answers, that is, correct or incorrect.
This type of thinking is associated with certain procedures, scientific or normal.
People with this type of intelligence have logical thinking, patterns may agree, solve problems, and work on scientific studies.
Humans are, in many ways, the most talented species in reading the minds of others.

MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (RMN), which was discovered in 1930 by Felix Block (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and scientific researcher, made the discovery of the magnetic resonance image as a tool for medical diagnostics.
Four years later a patent was issued, which was the first patent issued on the RMI campus.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scan of "cuerpu-enteru", which he called "Indomitable".

The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from the absolutes. There is no good way to learn.
Learning can't be done. Learning can happen in experience between learning and becoming acquainted with it.
Our current experience, with all these do-it-yourself programs or based on the presentation of information or learning, illustrates this aspect.
Many of us are looking at a television program that tells us a process or an experience we're not going to participate in or apply knowledge.
We will never fix a car, make a fountain in the yard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or reform the neighbor's house.
