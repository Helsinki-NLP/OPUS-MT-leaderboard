Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president of history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will receive them, inter alia, through the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and they will have much to do.
First, visit of the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple planned a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third one to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
Their war efforts increased even further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of their critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which particular organization.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránc in Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Defenders of Nature).
Last year he appealed several times against certain procedures for granting construction licences and to withdraw appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesman for the Litoměřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently under arrest and facing a sentence of up to three years ' imprisonment.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate trash
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia they can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There they need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally late in the separation of waste, not only because of the fact that we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever, for example, tried to throw a PET bottle to the right container in the center?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is at Moravské náměstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't get angry with me, Mr Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little.
There is no need to mention that elsewhere it is not easy to separate the trash.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Vaguely
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw into the trash several bottles of glass and plastic.
But at Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, on the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already stuffed with the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extract, which shames us all over the republic, and no more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the whole region of Jihomoravský kraj.
The "Paroubek" budget removed money from sickness incomes and subsidies
After the left, despite the government's opinion, add funds to farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness allowances or building savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government subsequently asked for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That only means deferring the problems for the future, it is to put mines," says Janota.
What happens is, when you borrow money, you have to pay more and more interest and, one day, you have to pay back the money.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If you do not reduce the social allowances or operating costs of the State, you have to increase taxes.
To everyone who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, so did your children.
People don't have to worry about sickness income or subsidies, they'll get them. Out of these accounts 1,800 million disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be lacking in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase alongside interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the money dislocations for the benefit of some groups of voters, the next year will also take five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mainly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe, nor is it a fundless bag.
Last year of ČEZ they allocated to the budget 18. billion.
Every year dividends are cleared of ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases by 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including in building savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Thereafter, the Minister will have to save money within the source or, in the worst case, to make use of the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million more for the Státní pokladna project (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and has already been initiated. It must allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone will work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just one key pressed, they spend a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualizer software.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at a time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware indicated in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago proved for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM memory of 128 MB, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to do virtualization testing of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only the telesquisc maintainers in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free tracks.
Lack of snow makes people not reserve ski rooms in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass through Špindler in Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to reserve their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers from Špindler in Mlýn offer mostly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabi, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the year on the snowless mountain.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also be exhausted," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free spaces.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the stay in Nochevieja are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, close to the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we find ourselves about sixty percent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers in Krkonoše will be able to pass the snowfalls waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures should fall and, if there are precipitations, the mountains should snow.
But after again the temperatures will rise, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
US: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the most foolish.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, expected with anxiety, it was demonstrated that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the phrase "just like in Iraq", but it did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward."
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible and catastrophic decision."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that nothing about Iraq is spoken of today in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than he might have expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan General Operation Stanley McCristal. He, despite the traditional subordinate relations, submitted to the indecisive gunmen in the White House a harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president wavered for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama’s whole strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years. Obama’s entire doctrine generated more questions than he offered.
Many doubt that the increase is the same as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is being reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing their boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin.After him will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by his volunteering.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon," will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of developments in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the United States will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential elections and that is why there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will never receive cash bonuses again
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced to respond to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares which cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to join the Wall Street bonuses with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest road it must take, mentioned the former investor banker of the entity JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism after having raised nearly $17 billion (almost $300 billion) for the bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the coming of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at once, with a tax of about 50 percent, bank bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories less physical
Five women, which is a record number, were given today in Stockholm by King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he also represented a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as by his fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize given, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee picked up the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel, the one of peace, received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janota's stay in the office, will be the themes of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the appointment, the spokesman for President Radim Ochvat informed.
About his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted on Wednesday the proposals from the left for the transfer of funds and increased the money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of the Fischer bureaucrat office, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, actually liquidates the package of savings, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the State Budget Act; today he stated during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long been neglecting "the serious problem", that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public estate.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said for ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is amazing, prepared for this year by former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles play them American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American Oscar-winner actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role Matt Damon plays.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
Seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in Eastwood's drama over the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up as a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to put an end to apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who united his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after the apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and therefore he decides to join rugby players, who belong globally to outsiders.
The South African team was able to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
I had no goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as real as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were outside the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I held her hand, I received her energy, it was transmitted and she had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon played the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met with Pienaar at his home for the first time.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienara in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of the journal Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The Secret of Splendor About Norway Resolved: Russians Tested a Missile · Global Voices
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence finally recognized yesterday that near the borders with Norway had evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, "Bulava" type, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was at first no problem.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again on the apparatus.
The engine probably crashed into the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which was floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians have not hesitated from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were sustained and the damage occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were discovered immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the releases went through completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defence management, only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost 50 percent full of general optimism and therefore continue to say that "Bulavá" one day will fly smoothly and even bring up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum weight of which is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-apply at 51 years of age for a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help your Moscow CSKA team and possibly play Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash gets hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, cited the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the famous player's return will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice courts, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and won 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in the NHL: playing with Detroit won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Chamber.
Hyundai met union requirements. He will cancel all additional work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesperson for the Hyundai automotive factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, since it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, i.e. we will work on two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, i.e. prolonging Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the extra work for December, Vaněk said.
The car factory employees were forced to work two hours more than eight hours and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař trade unions said on Wednesday that if they are committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are prepared to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went into strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of the Monday strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, last Wednesday, who interrupted the manufacture, were not penalized in any way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 kroner.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The production in series was started last November.
Until September last year, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance up to the HIV virus 'inflicted'
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines already accessible.
AIDS disease cannot be cured so far.
However, the lives of patients may be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs will no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University demonstrates the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitive and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation would not occur and the virus would not create mature and infectious bodies.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a number of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which remains systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was tested, as well as its resistant variants obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used medicines, however they do not lose its effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metalocarbons are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ★ezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "fearful" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, he said, think about its future existence.
The statements of the ODS were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
The vice president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the House of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however, with the modification proposals on the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for State officials' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of the SDGs, as the budget deficit is being sharply increased.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the wish of the government, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and inactivity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká television Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, that he's thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, Nečas in the government has nothing to do with the nominees of the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly, if he resigns, whether the chamber approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, highlighted Topolánek in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant positions there are people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to reassign the principle of struggle with the height of the deficit in public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the left majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies".
However, the support and tolerance of the members of the SDGs will not be available.
I have not thought about that, whenever the time comes, I will take care of it, told journalists in the chamber of deputies the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS yielded at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the House of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
By resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all positive things, Topolánek himself reacted.
Depending on the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will travel at almost the same rates
České drahy (Czech ferrocarriles) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today's day, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including basic and customer prices will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will, for example, win the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate again in Bratislava.
On the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the biggest reduction in Drahy-planned transport is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní Nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstration losses Drahy will receive the year coming four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the year coming will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and local Drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 krona for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed use hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted kidnappers because of violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Magundanao was due to the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23rd November massacre, related to the Governor's elections, there were 30 journalists.
For the suspicion of the involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
The history of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený) debuts in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the role protagonist Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere comes the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rohlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mveso, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
Great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they culminate in preparations for the world football championship. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, for - as it is said - to charge her energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the movie.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team suit
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the grammilla in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially the white audience and the recognition of white inhabitants.
The football championship may help people to join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
You will still see, if you improve the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rugby amateur Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lunsko it burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught a transformer from the company Čeps in the morning in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lunsko.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later they changed their opinion and the fire are extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokesperson, the failure did not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million kroner, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of Čeps nothing like this happened, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, ČEZ's spokesperson for northern Chechnya, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire of the electric substation did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps Čobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electric drive.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the electric drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three Heths of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander to three social democratic hetmans.
It is Michal Hašek of the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hemman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radiožurnal.
The demand has to do with the company's efforts, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České drahy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking pastries of cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České drahy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left for us but defense.
It's because of the slander towards Student Agency society, said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence of all regions, and he said that they have not taken necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million krona in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnal told him that he would interrupt the Christmas campaign and want to continue after the New Year.
It is clear that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České drahy to maintain regional railway links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion kroner did not summon a trend.
According to Jančura similar steps disagree with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave him, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, what you are talking about, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that mandatory vaccines would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccine against tyres culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free cows for children born in August
From January, children born from 2 August last year will be free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of child age.
Last year, part of the families voluntarily allowed their children to vaccinate against tyres.
However, parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are required to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without clutching they will save in treatment, which is needed for children who are not vaccinated.
So far, the state has spent the entire vaccination of children approximately 500,000 annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of mid-octitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumococal infections in our country each year die according to hospital investigations 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to Chechnya, the pneumatic vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association has been propagating pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way that we now have to take, said Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not think so at all, said his spokesman Vladimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékař ?Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they can be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts hope that from the next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to vaccinate against tyres.
The pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save then on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "get the money out of the health insurance."
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 pictures in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of such characters as Conan the Barbarus and Tarzán.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer stated that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, declared to the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure cuts in the previous budget report, in the face of opposition criticism, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "wasstriped" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticisms of damaging low- and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security expenditure and a 1% increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about £3 billion a year, has made the business community angry, which says that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLAVE POINTS OF THE REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will be more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
The 1-point increase in company tax for small firms was ruled out.
Tax reliefs for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who wins £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who wins £10,000 per year will win £ 110.
The Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and the cost cuts outlined were a "land grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the forecasts of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will influence the amount of borrowing and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4,75 % this year, much worse than the decrease by 3,5 % forecast in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Oportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of loan application for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to submit a credible plan on how the money would be returned, adding, "cinically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction of the deficit in the shortest term.
But the Democrat liberals said that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's expenditures, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "dry castles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to charges of electoral manoeuvres, as money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that more people are being provided and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False assumption"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only make it feel in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really putting the pain off for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
The FBI is investigating "American detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The American Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia State last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
He said that the house was already in the local police's eye and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on arrests, reported the news agency Reuters; but said that the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as disabled, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The detailed report "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected earlier criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei recognized some charges of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks, at a detention facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the ill-being of the government's election and response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and that the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
It looks under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The prizes were delivered to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event of Thursday afternoon, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested a ban on the construction of minarets and a widespread warning on the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why French people don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on questions that are of great interest to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
These are apparently mundane issues, it maintains, things of everyday life, things that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of fame, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadán, an Arab Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen's interview tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategies (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a set of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most despondent panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, bringing with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural story of the North Icon, the polar bear.
Known for the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the edge of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was put green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the massacre continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and skim Indians in motorcycles use high-power assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After Ice" Alumn Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling story about Arctic science and an overcrowding look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th century and early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the moving ice cords circulating under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the fluent system within the Arctic ice, made up of saltwater jets that are compressed while frozen.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier who had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns on veteran's graves in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year to different cities along the way, to conduct events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the commemorative site for Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a dead military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Surrounded in warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as new graves, said the organizers.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took hold of their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red loop tied to the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of the present wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names on the stones, while others bent to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who would wipe the tears from their eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Sgto Marine Gunner's tomb. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"Many after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributes mobiles and laptops in the country, the State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything considered "of danger".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and discourses are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient community blogger, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has asked on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the Communist government of Castro's brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a "slowly" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to spread news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in prison in Cuba is among gangs for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide further information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly disagreed.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the programme of the Americas of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials demarcate a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, demonstrating that they hope that the case will help to unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The researchers said they were pursuing an insurgent mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah addressed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an undercover operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that the men did not change and were even trying to get adequate approval to access the camps of al-Qaeda, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who is in trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has given priority to trying to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda analyses American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential for access to American goals and their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model than so many have already followed? stated Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here along the streets demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding signs in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "it's enough".
Several famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels of Peru, his mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal with due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already taking place. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he stated.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or for wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black suits placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called ones, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people met around the television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate into the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "Because the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that it affects negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal scoreboard last week on math performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best performance systems, the rating book showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students were bullying at a faster pace over the past two years, compared with the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Education Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of the fourth grade white students in the DC during the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in performance grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not quite large.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between the fourth grade white and black students in 2003 when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to just 58.
Education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not taking a leap of joy for a difference of two or three points, said the member of the Council of D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's style of administration, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what worries is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper and middle grades of primary school, who did not master the early reading grounds in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a math curriculum from Kindergarten to the sixth degree, emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who was credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level of grade, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can further increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here's a sort of squalid dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban testing scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now a school overseer in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is to extend the current 180-day public school year in the District to compete with self-employed schools.
Almost 200 days to have the power of change, Janey said, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, who considers it an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong breath.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the registration costs $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion teacher-students of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already absorbed their deliberate message completely: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who have access to university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduated from the university, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Its success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programmes can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to consider providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour of the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programs, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract large oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies moved away having climbed into only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as American military retreats, probably prevented American oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third most important crude reserve, said analysts.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have drawn close to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made great investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, the spokesperson of the Assam Jihad Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the same time as its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each stock.
The main planner of Qaeda has apparently been killed in Pakistan
A supposed U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a major Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the Waziristan Province of the North, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said a civil intelligence officer from Pakistan, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely broken bodies."
The local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner from Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was committed to conspiring around the world, said a high official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to Qaeda's superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had rapidly ascended the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat he posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of the Taliban Qaeda or leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jallov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has decreased since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to a The Long War Journal account, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
The UN's maximum envoy to Kabul about to resign
The United Nations maximum envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by accusations of corruption extended in the UN-supported presidential election of Afghanistan.
The exit of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said it supports the increase, but he is concerned that the US military withdrawal schedule that begins in 18 months encourages other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian staff working with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector needs to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission to Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously conducted UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also encouraged the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the burdensome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to capture talents.
This is how the UN rules have allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran because of their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war zone trip in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he maintained, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictableness of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would accept to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and saving time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have strayed from the attempting agreements, in part, affirms the experts, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing itself to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted at the beginning of October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama made a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "destructive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded and baseless accusations" Thursday, by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and stated that it has the will to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich Iraqi region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that enlivened them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means another grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said 31-year-old Wang, a human resources manager with an eight-month-old.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously recuperated children, malevolent single children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per partner, compared to six of the time the policy was implemented, according to the Division.
Population of the UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and more will be expected to exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the overall average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A Progressive Relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single child from China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-wife ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007, many of their hardline slogans were attenuated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said central government officials have been debating even more radical changes recently, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly the morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very overwhelming.
Disappointing response
While rural city officials outside Shanghai maintain that they have seen a moderate increase in the demands of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 will reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of Caolu municipality’s family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West view the single child policy incorrectly as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant by the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really do not want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two races, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about having enough success as to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from the parents, he held.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategy "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare facilities when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the dissemination of an ambitious document on greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations taking on their shoulders most of the load in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not discuss how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's largest climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent around 2050.
The European Union also stimulated talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday presented the same kind of artificial verbal fires that dominated the talks last week.
The US Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that demand mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries, compared to the volunteers from the major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei, said that the United States' highest climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" because he said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The present battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four countries in the most influential world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should be costing the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the large emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate supported, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that talks would ultimately produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, prepared a preliminary 24-page draft treaty on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues had to be resolved before the heads of government came to an end.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to the Bella Center corridors, to closed meetings and press conferences, in order to be able to delineate the complaints that will be arbitrate during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre every day, activists playing the guitar present night shows taunting the countries that they believe are being sold, and hand-in-hand preliminary proposals are being passed instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy of International Conservation.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 kmh from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a silvo will drill through the dark to point out a train exit marking a revolution for trips to Britain.
The country's first high-speed long distance train will reach 225 km/h, when passing like a beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be cut short, and the change of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds that are needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favored option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Penguins to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said one railway member.
Once finished, travel between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the space restrictions of the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines through the existing roads north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "for rations", increased his mortgage in £75,000 to build an extension framed on oak in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Near houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the planes as a "ran orange".
Neighbors described him as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his property in London to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to over £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the whole increase was going to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable BRE mortgage type dropped from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March this year, the type it is now located.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to request £1.250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that Members had to survive "rations" after the cost scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and I request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling pound symbol in Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the rise in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved by both the salary office and then by Legg."
He added: "It is not about circumventing and delinquenting or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the beach spa of Brighton
Brighton palates have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for every December day, using villains as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with full pastels and free ponche served.
The chosen villains up to now include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergy of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect as a Church that people come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Advent of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in protest of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital on the basis of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change is due to be reached by Friday, which will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with adoquines and hammers, reported a AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to the police, they were especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction", underlining that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the severe cold".
The fairly peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candled vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial chubaskers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" by "justice and by climate".
Today we took the streets to claim compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers are drying up, watercourses for which you can walk as you have never been able to do before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kickoff to demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and garnished handkerchiefs with slogans for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of demonstrators called for strong action against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Tens of people were concentrated in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounced "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5:00 p.m.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first interim results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "sorry that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is attempting to demonstrate by means of this choice that is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the ballot.
At a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank you for the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, responded by raising his vodka vase.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the abjasian railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes the delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, which was quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candled vigil.
A few moments after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported a AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adoquin, and four cars were set on fire near a house occupied during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups did not take their eyes off, prevent the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces overflew the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial chubaskers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" by "justice and by climate".

The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kickoff to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, manifested red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators called for action against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Informative on Sunday (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific scholarship.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor's degree will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "sufficient with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, summons the best students."
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be sub-rams of the C, it goes on to emphasize even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in the second degree of bachelor's degree in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French of ten (69%) disapproved the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second of Bachelor's degree C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives on the right also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the Second Bachelor's degree program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give proof of admission which will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also practice in real conditions during the year of M2, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he is going to propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
At the High Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain climate change convincingly
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, which accepted Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the conference wheel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, reported a AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and convey them a desire to know more, explained in the context of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who displayed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public would understand that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific record."
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgusting between prison guards, action is planned
The prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobility" to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers Force (2nd union of guards) asked the staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their assets.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", since it calls for "disgraceful and unacceptable" the failure of the payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convenes general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensured that the balance would be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts of the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I urged the Directorate of Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime is no longer occurring in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blames budgetary requirements," Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, he said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott up to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if the ones of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threat FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As our tasks and missions are increasing without more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff salary, it estimates the Burdeos Prison CGT.
According to the unions, not in all regions the same thing happens, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, stated Ufap Secretary General, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate their birthday parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be of the departure.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before he answered with humor pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who gave devotion to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts of childhood.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball basketball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Just years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of settling them around the house, however, I loved that doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims it's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to important "injuries" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his associates, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night on Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified "operational injuries" disc hernia carried out in Paris on 26 November, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repairing operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallday accepted, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about his or her condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also asserts that "according to some sources" no channel would have been introduced to him after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park international clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles hospital on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but assured him that he wasn't "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to do twelve hours of flying after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, claimed that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily with antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken with Laetika, the musician's wife, and he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "colon cancer" after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as was expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, his associates even had to deny a new admission.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first Bousquet title in your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the Long Pool World Cups-2009, won an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition where polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, which coveted the world record in 50 m free, the mark it owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of the swimming, in 50 m free, 28-year-old French was imposed at 20''53 during a final event where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet moved forward to Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathers that from 1 January will be prohibited.
These bathers, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epica in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in a long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself in full in this race.
I knew I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
US: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola was sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art marcher.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysic scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is an unusual piece, since there are only four or five in the world," explained Tuesday to the AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of the ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most uplifted by buyers, no doubt, pointed to the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as part of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time before the Marine Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted the departure from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup d'état denied his safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility to carry out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The plane of the Mexican government that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take her to Zelaya returned to her place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to provide him with a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "rescind" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as the guest Chief of State.
The coupist government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday on Globo radio, in which he often makes statements from the beginning of the political crisis that has been taking five months in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added playing chords to the President's deposit, refugee in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum order, declared Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coupist government, Oscar Raúl Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview at the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the detained president, who met around the Brazilian embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coupist government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day when he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coupist government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries of Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office was finished on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures on the closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, with a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.6 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotic, he clarified, considering that the market focused on "the medium full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures in the U.S. trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that they market with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has been the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield amounted to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4.492% against 4.408% on-the-spot.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power ambush the "Ladies of White"
This Thursday, hundreds of Cuban supporters of the power overtook the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital claiming the release of these detainees, a journalist from the AFP held.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" were beating up the militants of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian dress agents who came to "protect them."
On the eve of the day, a similar demonstration broke out against the "La Habana Ladies of White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the international human rights day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothing, reported a AFP journalist.
The agents forced the vehicles up to dissidents who were beaten by government supporters, according to that journalist.
Generally speaking, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom follow the bars.
Cuban authorities target opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on the manifestation of the government's militants on Thursday against the "contro-revolutionarys".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An assassinated killer with a knife and left 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the hour of greatest influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the Boulevard Jean-Jaureès, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to one officer of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about 30 years of age, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the bulevar Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old and one forty-eight seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unexplained.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed the back, explained in the place a union leader Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the disposal, according to the testimony obtained by the AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd was thrown over him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
By the bulevar Jean-Jaureès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were wounded by fists, according to the testimony of the police.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important injury in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, came with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Court Police of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He has not spoken during his interim detention.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer once again calls for the case to be dismissed
The counsel of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the cause against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", reported to three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "resulted chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who had died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before giving a sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But eventually Wells declared at the end of September that the author of the documentary had lied.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument if the court rejected the case's rejection.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no serious review of the charges as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a child under 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles district deputy Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear in the audience."
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing? Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor to the court, though he despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She claims that her client no longer supports her being harassed every time the Polanski case resurgences, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland in an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the fences, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and stops by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this blind Friday, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures on the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of a technological component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver said, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers was visibly recovered in December, 73.4 to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a further rise in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months compared to the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, from Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The ten-year Treasury bond yield amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss Mundo again in South Africa
After a month in South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Mundo's title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them had already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportist or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!," said amazed Miss Sierra Leone.
This nine-time event in South Africa will be broadcast on the live Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, beginning at 5 p.m. (15 GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take away the breath".
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safari, the candidates for Miss Mundo focus on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with bather.
China's presenter, Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty, Michelle McLean, and a committee officer from Miss Mundo, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved capable of receiving the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss Mundo contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I treated people I never thought I'd get to know.
She's probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallday "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going out very well, told press David Hallday on his way down from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the 13 o'clock locals (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, relaxed, assured that he would be moved "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection derived from the disc hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, following a disc hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, who attended his daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpétrière hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Monceau Park's international private clinic in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
You're talking about a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem with making the trip, because I was operated twice as a disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before at the RTL station, he indicated that the singer appeared to have "out of his cannula, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of brain hemorrhage.
It is a poor-reputed doctor, convicted by the courts on several occasions by malapaxis, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" demanded "with regularity" before the Order Council, and is " far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not provoke bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, has entered into a parenthesis.
No doubt, taking the tour back on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises its tone and warns the New Center on the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist Party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, only to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, since he felt that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after he had held his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, he received the assistance of Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to make a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the mark to them, on the basis of a court order.
Over the past few days, you have made many statements implying that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New center+, and the slogan + the UDF d'ajourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, support the signatures of the letter.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium, as well as of (its) Internet site".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to legitimate right-holders."
If not, justice will be appealed to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will warn.
In the letter, they need that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "chosen" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted its accession to MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continue the office, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It uses scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to perform it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before they mock the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to attempt to get out of anonymity taking fraudulently a name to which it is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the court of Nanterre decided to sue the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as stated by the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogeneary to expropriate her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star pictures of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fines.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even further under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report before 10 March 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think you'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said on leaving the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations sometimes resulted in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge has refused, in recent days, to take place at his request to open a judicial custody procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No other person may appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the trial on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be held.
Management Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter for employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as previously concerned to impose on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given its place to the strategies of conquering markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end up in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and even more business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; this requires employees to make a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the employees at the heart of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion surveys, such as Orange's questionnaire among its employees, encourage management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old conductist theory that the American "neurosciences" recently re-enacted, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread to their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms to the managers in a mechanical management position, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the management revolution needed for the good functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating all reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifal Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a default dosage that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and reposition the management of human resources "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Address: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure in the right wing of the Republican Party to the US Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recent memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historical, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider as a potential candidate for republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a President of the Left" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that "they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler in Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as "citizens of the world", as "always does," he "spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few on the right not very convinced, a Bush age hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, qualified the speech of "monoton, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the Internet National Review Online.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-central press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his "superproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "pronounced the discourse that was needed," said the New York Times, judging it "at the same time as dark and upbuilding."
Road Transport: Three Marathon Negotiations to Ensure Christmas Supply
After three marathon negotiations sessions, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat posed by the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" for the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours beginning at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very harmful to businesses" and "was afraid to disrupt the holidays of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9 per cent for higher (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from €8.72 to €9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we start with a lot of disadvantage, said Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or locks in the supply centres.
But there can always be some misconformity rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, allow for an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of EUR 100 million in employers' charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the Draft Law on Reform Finance for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to undertakings that are affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour extends.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "ingenuity business", since the EUR 100 million had already been pledged to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to counter those who want to eat turkey at the next dinner in Nochebuena, the Unostra lamented.
For the other, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions inconsistent with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the leadership of RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their demand for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas purchases, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10 and 20 hours, due to one train every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnecting with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Galleries Lafayette, which wait 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that "RATP is striving to provide service to the large shops."
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains circulated in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to get to time".
Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, SNCF indicated, which had provided for police and law enforcement supervision.
The RERs operating the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or destined to it arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "little satisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all respects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South) claiming a premium.
RATP even put its premium proposals in parenthesis, commented indignantly on the CGT, noting that the management "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
What also led the unions to say that the company "does not care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who had refused until then to speak during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents have submitted a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million passengers per day.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community by trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although it took only a majority of seven votes to obtain the dissolution, Kilicz pointed out, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including its President Ahmet Türk and the MP Aysel Tugluk, are away from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Türk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The decision arises following a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Tribunal ' s verdict is taking action when the government is helping the Kurdish community by proposing a number of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could generate a rise in tensions in the Southeast Anatolium, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police during the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the Southeast mostly inhabited by Kurds.
The Order Forces dropped tear grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators launched Molotov bombs or stones with hounds.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, she told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
Nothing is resolved, said the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Snows can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Braenburger wants.
At all, it is something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the EDF
But with this their employees can learn to test and dominate the whole of vehicle technology.
Maybe the weekend meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections with large salt vehicles, explains Braenburger.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the firefighters' body, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and we trim with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF service begins around three o'clock in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, should be covered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better attached.
That is why the EDF begins around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space to the salted vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is lateral and secondary streets.
That's where the nuisances are generated, you know Braenburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the EDF could not take care of all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braenburger.
As these are rapidly rebounds, the salted vehicle is set in motion as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa found the same look as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran over the two strong hind legs, had a broad head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with hoz-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found it was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a excavation in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, in one day, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triasic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered together in total the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time some 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous teropods between those found the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupid saupods known as the "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivores (sauris with bird pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa foundae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt comments.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also own the descendants of the teropods, the birds.
Thanks to airbags, bird breathing is more efficient than mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently filled with air partially.
Tawa is the teropod with older and more primitive air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also owned airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers conclude that the saurias first appeared there.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages were separated at an early stage and extended from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the remains of two other not very closely related teropods.
The three cannot descend from a single parented predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were set to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the current Poland, says the paleontologist Bonn Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is little to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to Mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triasic dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurians and with many other saurias.
Towards the end of the Triastic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the limit of the Triastic towards the Jurassic.
Successive Stories Were Not Eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competitors in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact brakes the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino at Goethe University of Frankfurt affected the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the students protesting at the Campus de Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers in an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Authenticated protest
Young people from the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, nevertheless defended the action of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented on an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, deputy of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The view of opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of carefully studying students' arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion asking the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from central Moscow, is considered the "Silicon Valley Russian".
Here are important research and production centres of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives from Selenograd have contacted Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "close collaboration protocol" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research centre.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortia and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Citizen of Socialist Planning" for arms research.
Selenograd (translated literally as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not set at all high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply and clearly "the new heart of Europe".
The law alone. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered to be engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since it used to take a huge amount of time to catch the locomotives from behind.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must it be done.
And that's why the terminals must have disappeared: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is approximately half the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course do not have any more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built frame towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have made that clear.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by road trucks.
However, the new construction sections are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossings and narrow passes on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the trace has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport.
The federal government remains pending in Wiesbaden's autonomic parliament, if it is to file an appeal before the ruling on the prohibition of night flights from the Hesse Administrative Court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the judgment of the VGH, over 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had based on writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest landing runway at Frankfurt Airport, the federal state would have to re-regulated the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be commensible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is to file the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal before the National Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of a word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the chief of the Tarek Al-Wazir greens, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federative government would be attempting by twisting the law and tricks still getting their night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick print".
We need a legally unattainable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition stands, it would never have been his group's claims about the ban on night air traffic.
The U.S. banks are returning the aid.
The large American banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned once again the aid provided by the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund of a total of 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30 billion).
Also, the Citi Group plans to return state aid, according to a report by the CNBC of the United States.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of the bonuses to the directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others, for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the efforts of the bank to absorb the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to obtain money on the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the US bank could already announce for this Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Election
In the end, everything was faster than it was thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present to a successor.
Last night, the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it probably also influenced not to further damage the director of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not yet concrete when this edition was closed.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union on the administrative board had indicated weeks before the election, that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the chief editor had been organized by the president of the government of Hesse, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the ZDF informations would have lost audience rates.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flailed.
At the end, 35 public law specialists, who described Koch as unconstitutional, had become involved in the debate.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romantic philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to ZDF, in principle to "heute-journal" information.
Next seasons: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the removal of Brender, who was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of partisan politicians from the ZDF control guilds was discarded by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Peter Frey, was recommended before the administrative council with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a partisan sectarian.
In the calculations of the Frey parties is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
University careers clear
Partly success for students: after one year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of undergraduate and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the load of exams: basically each career module should end with a single examination.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of the results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
Federal states undertake to make structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master racing.
Regulations of the federal states that diverge from this must no longer exist.
Fewer reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the university leaders are continually talking about improving the ability to successfully carry out and complete a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, we talked about a particular content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", it says in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to the unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, which enable and promote their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is established by the federal states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Only Rhineland-Platinada has so far ensured that it provides additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single examination should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, and it is also intended to ensure recognition of evaluations at other universities and to facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year we intend to examine all the races about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition once again discussed the conditions for study in the federal state.
Apart from the commendations, there were also criticisms about decisions.
At the federal level board of the Josou university groups (socialist youth) it was necessary that the setting up of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
By the end of the education strikes, students should now be able to take an opinion as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the student experience," said Thursday in a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility of accessing a later Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to find a lot more teachers.
But regarding greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"To enter and leave Germany is made practically out of control," says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced idionic fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner received several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable poetry lectures or lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said that he spoke quite a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his security files"
Visiblely insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in Romanian secret service Security against fellow German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
The recruitment attempts had started slowly in early 1971.
"So I'm someone who didn't defend himself enough in the face of the efforts to provoke fear of the Security," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize of literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abismos and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as yet known, not only author but also victim.
In his file of Security IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of the IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all the hard points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July on the weekly "Zeit", after reading his own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases will have known what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's pseudonyms.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the security control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and has been difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Security Council (CNSAS), under the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is more traceable.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proved that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former chief of the Temesvar Security spoke respectfully of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," she was questioned only once in the end.
The infamous power seemed to be able to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent mistakes.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of Söllner lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desires of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, is more than a simple note at the foot.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When Stuttgart's new VfB football team coach, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team provider, approached a Mercedes C taxi a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outdoor service member was leaving from a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a driver because he had not yet met the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, nor was he drunk with joy the 55-year-old man.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reach the eighths of the finals," that is, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded for success: we will have to fight brutally against descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, in Maguncia it will be necessary to repeat the success of the "real classes" in the everyday life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Success
Eighty-eighths at the end of the Champions League (parts from 16/17 and 23/24 February/parts back 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was limited by the fulminant entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired the confused professions of Stuttgart to trust themselves, ready to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained the Gross soul repairer his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the Babbel therapist no longer had effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks' break due to an injury, immediately progressed to becoming the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way to work from the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was missing, of course, when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constancy.
Like Gross, players and administrators also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relief and totally overrun by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, thought Khedira.
And executive Horst Heldt warned that although a season target had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't solved the problem yet.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate at his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-upgraded in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by Porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, have faced the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change as a coach because of the pressure of teen fans.
Also that he would have eliminated his day off after the games called him Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," answered Heldt, and announced consequences for the latter.
They're probably not gonna be friends forever, the two of them.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without prior efforts with the replacement coach's team, it would not have been possible to show great game and battle force.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and also agreed the man of the plastic suitcase.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning duel in Bern: Kevin Johnson was again and again provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge's trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday night to Saturday in Bern to the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was already twice a world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to do what everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice had to be defeated due to his injuries.
The Johnson retractor had to accept the first defeat in his fighting number 24.
Before some 17000 spectators in the Arena of Bern, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging again and again from the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively lead to his goal his dangerous right.
In general terms, the Johnson liabilities did too little for a retractor, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retractor had already produced a scandal in the Swiss capital.
I had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," that "he doesn't know how to do anything."
While weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he then defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Areola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one blow, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still gathering all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he landed in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence a liar, Gutenberg, due to false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and leftists require an explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of being dubious.
On Saturday's news broadcast "Tagesschau", broadcast by the ARD television channel, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "in the knowledge he had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and which Mr. Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
Friday it had been revealed that in this attack it was not only about destroying kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder was part of Afghanistan's policy of the federal government, and whether the Ministry, the army and the information service had approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his fellow Greenman Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The chancellorship did not exert any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also expressed doubts about the Ministry's presentation on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely of the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a field patrol report.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday about the complaints made to it, and it noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade away.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can freely give ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleeplike states during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as mad or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drug addicts.
Our imagination is blamed: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be undrawn.
The onlyly modified states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, such processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Charles Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Alucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neural communication substances in the brain has been derailed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the onlyic states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disprositions, formations allocated, and mirrors of it".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two dimensions and surprisingly colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels like a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red flies like blood, deformed, grinding teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Stirred and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, binds them to form a hanging knot, and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
It goes up in a bowl and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
What a lesson for you!, they yell at the voices in a chorus that suits the timpanians, "Go to the clinic and get yourself healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also manic-depressive, it takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, she says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time it enters a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency may lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that besides genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it's still an incognito how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is a previous provision.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's communicable system.
When the brain is warmed
The logic of all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
The perception of hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, along with psychic disorders such as personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic traumas .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly tolerated; when our brain is warmed up, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, evil of love or other exceptional brain states.
In the Jüngeren Student gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindesten einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended a high school.
A common girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a boy clumsy with long and dark hair gives him the word.
When she answers her, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
In the evenings, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room when the dream comes, which often comes late and is scarce, he can't tell whether he's awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the flies or the girl with bleeding cuts in his arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Your parents and friends haven't told you anything, they'd think you're crazy.
In the fall of 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
He approved last year's selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you've been in contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a time he will start to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it is responsible for the same pursuit of entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13 years of age, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noisy impressions, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually get pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and physician head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropaty, who experience motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a complete and permanent motor disability, it replaces a real situation that is very dangerous by a world of its own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of limit situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inexhaustible situation itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into anything of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an act of saving the soul.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after an operation of heart transplanted heart valves, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was seen lying on the bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was guarding for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow fire and met a Korean mobster.
He gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
Children will take care of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at age 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, aged 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been adjusted as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the presidency of the Board of Directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This 52 member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and thus came responsibility for the company’s assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the stamp of the editorial.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save 10, 15-year-old differences," says Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family companies are not safe from decay: "This has always affected families who allow themselves to be infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "major delusions," says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor in this country, as was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" on the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything - in matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within your reach.
This is what appears to have been proposed The English Court, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the octave plant, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - who handles laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, who owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teatery stands out, with more than 130 different classes from this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while looking at the best views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and taking a sample of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' who are guiding the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 am to 22:00 pm at night.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the City Hall of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for Electrical Vehicle Implementation) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVEL Plan, to boost the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a quiet horizon' for the motor sector
The president of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, overlooks "a quiet horizon" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main exporting sector in the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automation Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an overview of abandonment, closure of some of our main productive plants," said the president of the Government.
"Through this plan and at the disposal of the brands to be followed in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotion Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3. billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automobile brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by 40 percent in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 in the Pavilion of Crystal of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only classic motorcycles and cars can be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the pavilion exhibitors, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, plugins, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior tests of skill
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, tests of skill, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be performed with classic cars and motorcycles on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sport is not respected with respect to the environment.
For this reason, Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stopping and booting system - called i-Stop-, a device that at least currently is only available with the engine 2.0 gasoline with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved throughout it.
Finishes, vehicle termination, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front armchairs present an excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the table of instruments and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which everyone wants to beat.
Continued with the habitat, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is added to a large and regular trunk.
The engine stopping and auto-starting system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse gasoline engine and with the manual change of six marches.
This engine is a real delight. It excels by its fineness, by its reduced noise, by the benefits and by achieving consumption content.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometres a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort and its consumption content.
Regarding the level of equipment, the chosen version for the test is the so-called Sportive, which incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
From the series equipment especially the rail change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive inner mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in case of lack of equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: vignon adaptive lights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is particularly noteworthy for the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven -Sportive- version.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'First'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shined more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five-minute fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Given the success of the company has pulled out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in return for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what it is to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience you need a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated earrings to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have had only a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and with reason.
Let a device such as FonPeek (it is always curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) get this type of tariffs means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no gaitas.
It's a connected device and it's paid for by buying it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a life-access purchasing option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If you have already come to the possession of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same one to accompany you in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on two occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections -, twice the outfit was composed of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat of the same cloth - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the vesture.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a stamped napkin.
The additions have also varied: green shoes from half heel again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, melena looses the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and work path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age had no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers had limited job opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of matrimonial cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start dating first, advance maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay their coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35-49 with fixed work have their first child, on average 3.7 years after beginning their cohabitation, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have required more time of their vital journey to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of their children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on maternity even less on the timing of mating," explains the researcher at CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they are married and when they have the first stalemate.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they are married and their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1-32.1 on average respectively.
"There is also another division between women based on their level of education.
While those who have elementary education get married and have their first child before achieving a stable job, those of medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year on, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, playing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international panorama, joins other famous pieces of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in "Lost").
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of his prizes, held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent’s poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Poquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays by writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitement and Vicent does not save any fears or enlightenments.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
Here I leave some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same as I felt without a name: pleasure against blind fate, guiltless morals and innocence without any gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihillist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of the 8,000 meters of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are laid off again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said he was heir to a landowner of the county and others who was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the mad scream thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did it on a trip fleeing from himself and calling for posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he fell on his knees and prayed, 'Dear God, please stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life long pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted as normal that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has the case of such a patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was before his madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but go to Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 passed along with her and our dog, a copy of a mestizo race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they gave her two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our outrage is capital because we did not find fun in a free aggression to a helpless little animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this it must be added the suffocation that caused a woman who walked quietly and who, when she cremated these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, as an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same thing with a woman, a child, an elderly person or, ultimately, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday evening any one by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt it would be useful for much and not to generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the cowards were Spanish.
Infuriation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to treat a helpless animal for free that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, especially among the younger drivers, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in case of an accident while travelling on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "is going beyond designing and manufacturing products every day safer" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly secure products.
Move up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, account for the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decreases, according to figures from the employers of the Amphac manufacturers and the sales of Ganvam.
The good data, however, should be put into quarantine, since the reference to which the comparison is made -November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the last month's rebound, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous exercise.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the tailoring box of light commercials: derived from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chasses.
Also, no nubarrons that most affect their demand have disappeared, as although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, paying almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
As a result of the restrictions on the closure of bank claims, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
In addition to individuals, the autonomous companies and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been evidenced.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles as well as to industrial (cars and buses).
The sales association predicts 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the anti-locking of ABS brakes and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all tourism and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, in its way of working, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's piston.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not hit the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided by year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four claims with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delays the plan for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed on by the affected party.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made within the next few days.
This is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes strength from the Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the steering wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and jewel face, Porsche's engineers took Boxster S as a base and managed to thin down anything less than 80 kilograms, which left the scale in only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to exclude, first, the automatic roof that has been supplied by a hand-operated canvas, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' other 15; removing the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gained 7 kilos more; mounting other 12 sports bacquets and with the light 19 inches wheels, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and changing the door shooters by some screen, the remaining kilograms.
Although it is also offered with the PDK double clutch change, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual six-speed box, mainly by secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with really reversed traces
Your behavior can only be described as unattainable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, all the opposite: we had not tested a model so small and light that at the same time it transmitted so much safety in the curved passage, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short march for the time necessary, until we command him to push, brake, recover and re-express his engine...
Thanks to your address, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Motor sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be potentiated with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine’s roar, which has already emerged earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from the ground up or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car said well the berries.
Electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, as well as early in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Close to Karl lagerafeld, image of Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlet' of the parades of the 'maison', the singer produces her malt face with as much customary as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.

The Labor Fund achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 on its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and thus is located in the leadership of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triple scores was the best of his team (29 appreciation).
The Victorian team was aware of the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer until the end to be done with victory.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triple annotated had much to do with the final triumph.
The game started face-to-face for the tiles, which were placed from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four baskets of the victors were from the perimeter already presuming that they had jumped to the Israeli field with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects from 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more than the same, but the alavés team opted for the interior game of Barac and the work of Elihu, who was received with balls and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of Splitter''s valuation already presumed that this was not going to be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being incarcerated at rest, was not determined by much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victors that in their field they did not win anyone, and with 'Elijah's hand grasping' they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turn of the yellows to the bright (50-49).
Most Disadvantaged
Ivanovic's, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hijack a pair of games successfully to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a tranquilizing income (54-67), which was able to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaveses left their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's ones did not rush, defended well, and even though the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv first in the season.
The injuries prevent the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaja suddenly lost in Greece before the Olympics and gave him the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the casualties of the cashiers, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malague team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and Friendship, nor by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, disillusioned the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacus was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bouroussis, Vujcic and Schortsaniitis, turned to the marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, conate of fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the fall by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez, were crawling the cashiers.
Between the interior players and the Lithuanian alert Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible ride back
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacus, which despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even matched the difference of the meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group tamble.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last fall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the One by the leadership and triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they pressed and gave their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to remount basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, delivering leadership to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the highest number of classified listings of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The How much should you charge? tool calculates the wages of users from over 140.000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they should introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the researcher has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from his searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges EUR 45,226 gross annually and a French one, 31.059, compared to the 24,000 that receives a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros per year net; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date to the departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has termed Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President's deposit shall leave the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010 at the latest when he officially completes his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the status of political asylum which he intended to impose on him by the "de facto" government, which is President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant point in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be strange as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving a liquidity-free bar to types close to zero for financial institutions to purchase assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to put some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have re-occured, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differentials of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the lower rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral risk defenders who again tried to create awareness on those responsible for world economic policy because they have curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what they should do is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, what in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the emires to recompose power in the Emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that strips the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials extend as much as European corporate bonds we should not worry about.
If European differentials decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario at the top for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, who return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not long for their warning.
Again, it has all the look that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is debated these days over the next two decades.
After his intervention, following that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommission.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be of 60 billion, but of up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be intended to increase generation capacity, but rather in distribution networks and in international interconnections
From 2020 onwards, the issue has changed and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that has just passed the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "pointing" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be taken as long as they are slow to mature and a stable, remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handling at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, Swiss Swissport, is going to play the role as a favourite partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not transcended economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Infrastructural Innovation Centre.
The partnership envisages an investment of 20 million up to 2012, 50% of which corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Action disputes your first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Acciona to sit in the country as a builder and concessionaire of highways.
City Council wants to get it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase they compete with three consortia with a remarkable presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its colleagues are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield infrastructure manager and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the ridge is the so-called LBRJV, where Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala specializing in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it has a clear difficulty in entering unless it is through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of the so-called Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed by a geographical area of the utmost importance to the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the sale business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies to raise and manage Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and use synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the West Highway of Toowong with the circumvalidation route in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the greatest performance to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that a contract with the Government was valued at 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through her local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer rapid internet access to 400,000 people and will work for 18 months in Germany.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a Slovenian highway amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The firm obtains this contract days after it is done with the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its deadline will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Mrs Rushmore's agency for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies who presented themselves to the contest convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the past three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Many 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephones with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes beyond regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a recurrence.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed the stela of other operators and has opened an Internet app shop, with the aim of increasing income not derived from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that most money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from big clubs.
Thus, the competition has distributed €5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was set up in 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have been well-stopped from this distribution.
The white club has been the third on the continent that most money has been paid for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the long-lasting Europe Cup in 1992 is the fifth of the ranking.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, the two teams who also billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chairing Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous ranking round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There is also bonus to win (EUR 800,000) and draw (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million to win the Europe Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is of the main, and has four seats assigned.
The champion of the previous year is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of parties played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group yesterday degraded the details of the offer of purchase of shares with which it pursues to acquire a peak of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage which does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share which would be disbursed in 10 years and which would be paid with an interest for that 1 per cent annual deferral
Yesterday Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Georgian group gives 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV ensured that it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos' capitalisation is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay apart from possible offers of purchase and the judicial vavenes of their former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to occupy a high position in the food company.
This is a new establishment post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience yesterday that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorizes the opa of exclusion of Paternine that presented Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation to understand that its terms comply with the existing rules and consider the contents of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of weather and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No loss is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculated manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including piece of work, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of little importance.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, and then to developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the American Solera group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxation and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain, work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, to the extent that more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies start to work.
It is very hard work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and priced.
In addition, each model performs a "smart" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinked".
If it is a model of sales, the job can be ready within a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
The most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the circulating mobile park, they exceed 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Each month includes 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard solution for the valuation of claims, for the experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and heavy or light industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5,75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which does thousands of expertries, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its backrest number.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to upload by vehicles declared to be fatal.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by homodeleous brands.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop because of failures or how many have suffered severe losses in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to official parts or prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for damage assessment, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year's internationalization process began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19,1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and now its shares are worth $2.4 billion in total.
Since 2007 it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction for injured cars
Last October, the Solera group purchased Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of automobiles such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction amounted to EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scraps and professional sellers who must register before they start operating.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and some 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market each day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose rear number has been lowered cannot be recirculated, but can be used as a replacement for certain parts that are not damaged.
Historically-valued cars can get up even if they have been discharged after a tedious effort.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the replacement, create the budget and generate the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals that to a greater or lesser extent they are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tours, 109 totterrenos, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it requires a computer with Internet connection.
