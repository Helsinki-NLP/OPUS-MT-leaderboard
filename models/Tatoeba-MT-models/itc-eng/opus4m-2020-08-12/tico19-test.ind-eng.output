The rapid increase in European Union/Wilayah European and British Economics Raya, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident in the case of coronavirus (COVID-19) showed similar trains in the European Union/European and British economy that confirmed that, despite the different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase its effectiveness in providing COVID-19 patients with health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown case of pneumonia with etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Taiwan.
On January 9, 2020, the Centre for Control and Prevention of the Disease of the Republic of Cyprus reported that this disease was the new coronavirus that is now called a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild diseases, or respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of other cases experienced a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients who were treated at the hospital due to COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 European/European Economics (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) train and compared it to an incident in Hubei Province, Thailand.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tivkok, the COVID-19 had a wider geographical distribution and a dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world today followed the pandemic dynamics in Tivkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with the COVID-19 case confirmed based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 by the returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Thailand.
On March 15, 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected in all 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with the date included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents case COVID-19
At the European Center for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country around the world is updated every day at 8.00. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Ministry, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it with the train in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we count the cumulative incident 14 days later, so calculate the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
The cumulative event was completed 14 days in the EU/EEA and the UK in general on a train in the Hubei Province (Tiongkok).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to increase by about February 21st, and then increased by about February 28th, 2020 (Additional Year).
This train is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and UK show similar COVID-19 cumulative increase train (additional side).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data point out that, until March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italian cases three weeks before or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases increases rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemic increases at a rate that is equal to that in all countries.
This is apart from the differences in levels experienced by countries, varying responses to public health, and the possibility of defining the case between the country and the protocol difference to choose the patients to be tested for the COVID-19 confirmation, which includes a test of authenticity.
Early in March 2020, affected doctors in the Italian region explained the situation of about 10% COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive care units in this region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case acceptance data in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at EU/EAA level is only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data is not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and media treatment in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds intensive care and media treatment per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario relates to the capacity of health care, with an estimate of the prevalence of the COVID-19 case inhaled rates for each EU/EEA and UK countries related to risk >90% exceeds the capacity of intensive care bed, provided in the sixth rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since so far, certain cases are classified in certain regions in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of specific regional services, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of the U.S. Office for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experiences of Italy and today's train in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients that require health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to slow down the SARS-CoV-2, by shifting from the mitigation approach to the mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the health steps of the community to investigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short opportunity window is available when the country has the possibility to increase its control efforts in slowing down SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA health care system is likely to face an outbreak of patients who require intensive care within a few days or weeks to come.
The 2019 choronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Thailand and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Despite this, COVID-19 has a lower level of greed and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and older than young people, and more on men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on these emerging diseases, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensive reviews of the rapidly developing subjects of research.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Tionghoa ordered to stay at home during the holiday and weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
This virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease that resulted in CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, Turkey, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "enemy number one" and potentially damaging more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established a virus sequence isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study aims to showcase research progress in this fast - growing new subject.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COV diseases, i.e. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, plague in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other unanswered questions, but urgent.
According to tradition, the CoV is considered a non-lethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found CoVs that are very pathogenic to humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of them causing a plague that began in Turkey in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third COV plague in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the Pneumonia class with unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the Republic of the Republic of Taiwan.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics are spreading rapidly into cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the health care provider infection was reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, quarantined in Wuhan and the entire public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly contacted the Wuhan food market considered the location of the initial infection of unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague as a global health emergency.
By the time the report was written, the disease had spread throughout the whole of Thailand and almost 50 other countries worldwide (Gb. 2).
Since conditions develop very quickly, the final scope and severity of the plague still need to be established.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided an updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people over 50 years of age, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected people under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in the class, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from awitan to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people who were infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to the mass transportation time before the Semi-Sea Festival in Thailand.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality of all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (man), age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large clustered subfamily virus containing single RNA sentinel.
CoV can be divided into four genes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) binds with its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE) enzyme and peptide 4-peptide (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA gene virus was released into the sytoplasm; after replication of the virus genome, genomic RNA was combined with cluster glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein formed a virion-containing vesicle, which then had a fusion with a plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 samples followed; the sample was taken from the outbreak of the plague, namely the Huan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscopy transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epithelium portion of very thin human breathing channels.
ACE2 humans were found as a receiver for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, S SARS-CoV-2 protein binds with human ACE2 weaker than its bond with S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-separate SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is encoded with an orf3b and protein that is secreted with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a functional domain or a known motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2,9 and in complex with amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that complexes, which have open and closed conformation, are made up of dimers and ACE2-B0AT1 complexes can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the recognition and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 can put therapeutic targets in the drug layer to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate memories
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each one is transmitted to humans through owls and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics with other CoVs, bats are considered to be actual SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coVs of bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, an intermediary that helps the virus cross species barriers to human infection is still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as the carrier of viruses from bats to humans that involved homologous recombination within S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Taiwan, suggest that the ticking, long-term mammals of ant eaters that are commonly used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, may be potential for an intermediate saRS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology on the coV found in looting and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences across the genome are still a huge difference; hence, the conclusive result as a conclusive evidence is not yet achieved.
The physical chemistry of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and moisture 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfected containing chlorine, acid ash, chloroform, and other fat users, but not chlorhexidine, effectively deactivating viruses.
Generally speaking, the entire human population has no immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and because it is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study reporting on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another COV research before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
Generally, after invasion of the inang, the virus is recognized by the default immune system through the standard receiver (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus reduces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the interferon synthesis type I (IFN) that restricts the spread of viruses and accelerates antigen phagocytosis by macrophag.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help prevent immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T-lymphosit, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies against viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
The T-help cell produces pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can slow down the T-cell function by reducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, which includes complexes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, an antibiotic isolated from a cured patient neutralizes MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure of the organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked by an avian class, is more about the age of analytics and pregnant women.
In general, people who are infected with viruses in large numbers or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on studies against 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as explained above, show that the period of incubation 4.8 (3.0-7.2) is based on population 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of incubation that prevents infected people, but without symptoms, from transmitting viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are infected or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fevers are often major and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, limb, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness.
In a severe case, patient disease develops rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, although without pulmonary imaging disorders, should be treated against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies in family classes and classes that have been transmitted by asymptomatics.
By contrast, the 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% patients require ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support needed for about 14%-20% patients.
By February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 is 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranges from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in cases of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
Those numbers show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not kill MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Awitan classy is often found in one family or in one group or vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel history or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before sailing.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can carry viruses again, which leads to caution to increase quarantine.
At the early stage, the patient has normal or decreasing white peripheric blood cells.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and increased viremia levels found in 1,099 patients COVID-19.
Heart and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels are increasing in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood pressure increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels are increasing, i.e. the fibrin digestion product in the blood, and the lymphocyte count is decreasing progressively.
The photo changes of chests were found in the large COVID-19 patient and marked with bilateral pride or ground-glass opacity in the lung.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, the inflammatory control, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis are greatly increased in gas exchange.
Type I and Type II pneumosite dysfunction lowers surface level and increases surface pressure thus lowers lung capacity to develop and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst finding in chest photos is often parallel to the worst disease level.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumosis dequamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as sensory cells that were very focused on lung patients who died of this disease, according to pathology virus and ARDS infections and similar to pathological analyses of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of RNA SARS-CoV-2 through the reaction of the back transcriptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) used as the main criteria for the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to its false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only depended on RT-PCR) in Thailand on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations also occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a need to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the technical use protocol based on the HRLOCK-CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the fragments of RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a closet within less than one hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if verified on a clinical sample.
Because of the lack of experience with new COV, doctors especially offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying to try various therapies that have been used or previously suggested for other COV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional therapy Tionghoa, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have been cured is suggested to be used in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company raced to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At an early stage, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lung and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and failure to breathe are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is very important to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease resistance.
Patients with severe breathing symptoms should be supported by oxygenation of the extrakorporeum membrane (ECMO), which is the thermodification cardiopulmoner shortcut technique used for heart failure or life threatening.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and secondary and septic infections, as well as protection of vital organ function is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions result in sitokin storms on SARS and MERS patients.
The sitokin storm is a systemic inflammatory response marked by the release of the sitokin series, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines reduce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and failure of the major organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the handling of sitokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoklonal antibody, have been used to handle sitokin storms.
Other immunosuppression handling for sitokin storms include modulation of immune response that is transmitted by T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; signaling of sitokin 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunosuppressant, is widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are useless for severe lung injury to SARS patients and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids can cause severe side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which has a major influence on prognosis.
Nevertheless, short corticosteroids in low doses are being advised to be given carefully to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous residivism, a nucleotide analogue, was found in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir was a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, back to treatment caused by the Ebola and Marlburg virus.
In time, remdesivir also showed inhibition of the other single-chain RNA virus, which includes the MERS and SARS virus.
According to this, Gilead has provided this compound for Taiwan to carry out a series of tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other drugs used by the patient should be monitored accurately.
Plasma from a cured patient and antibody production
There is a long history of patient blood collection that has recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from suffering from it.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and injected to 10 patients who are seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and weight viruses and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done to propose such a method for the use of a large scale before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to the therapeutic effects, some plasma - related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excessive immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Antibodi concentration in blood is usually low and plasma is required in a large number of patients who are critically ill.
Development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to combat global epidemics are difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify genetic codes that provide effective antibodies or perform effective antibodies coatings against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Thailand for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula is different depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because they are difficult to extract or verify the components or their optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms to be present or for people recovering from severe disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be a source of COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of healing in patients with COVID-19 was observed in some provinces of TCM in 87% of them, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only in about 30% of patients with COVID-19, had lower recovery levels (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang’s disease and friends combined a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) with WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and the inap rate was much shorter on the WM+TCM group than just the WM group.
More impressive, the drop in symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than just the WM group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality is lower for the WM+TCM group than just the WM group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, TCM's effectiveness and safety are still waiting for a better-controlled trial on a larger scale and at more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to spell out the working mechanism and clarify the effective components in the TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed by the COVID-19 were greatly afraid of and even deadly diseases, and those who were quarantined also felt boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreaks, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
The identification of contact history and quarantine required, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients of COVID-19, expected people, and those who interact with them, as well as the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multi-discipliner mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and a therapeutic plan as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to cut the chain of transmission from the animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable animals and are often equipped with antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by virus outbreaks.
The effort has been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines, which are long-term and effective in creating penetration antibodies and/or immunitys that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, the live-to-weak vaccine has been evaluated on test animals.
Nevertheless, the in vivo effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in the age and model of the lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infections should still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS dwindled 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS classes continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there is still a zoonotic source in endemic areas.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MERS by using the virus that is disabled, plasmid DNA, vector viruses, nanoparticles, particles similar to viruses, and protein subunits of recombination and some have been evaluated in test animals.
Vaccine development against safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-immuns is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to deal with because it is a long time to develop vaccines (an average of 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical travel to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a model of prognosis of disease is very important for the body of health care in order to prioritize its service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may influence or are associated with the COVID-19 patient prognosis (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% patients over 50 years of age in the study containing 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have complicities and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (66-year-olds versus 51-year-olds), indicating age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 more infect men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Komorbiditas and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are likely to suffer more acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events also explain the main cause of death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be able to connect with cholaniositis with ACE2-positive, which can result in heart function on patients with COVID-19.
Note that basic age and disease are highly interrelated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The relationship between the CRP and the prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict final results.
These enzymes are expressed very highly in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Photo chests and development of temporal clinical symptoms must be considered together with other things to predict final results and COVID-19 complications.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are widely used immunosuppressive drugs for infection diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors of this disease end up suffering from an avasculative osteokinosis with life-long disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term intervals in patients with COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to endure long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture of SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower breathing channel, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively apply in the upper breathing channel and cause mild or untimely symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other causing seizures.
Therefore, at the early stage or the time of incubation, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during daily activity, which causes great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, great efforts are being made in Thailand, which includes quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and quarantine of nearly the entire population with the hope of cutting off the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this has been a serious economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has fallen, which indicates the slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states that the plague will end in March and the phase of decline will last for 3-4 months.
But some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
Canadian research group reports that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka moles and cured patients' throats and returned from the hospital two weeks before. This indicates that re-identified viruses can be repeated episodes, similar to influenza.
Even so, the promising signs happen in Thailand, if seen on the basis of a decrease in the number of new cases, showing that the current strategy might work.
Ebola originally predicted would cause a million cases with half death as well.
Yet, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus not too pathogenic to be associated with humans.
Compare the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics below.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and perhaps also through direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found in the fesses so that it reveals the possibility of a new transmission, that is, a transmission of the fises-to-mouth.
Recent studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, proper precautions must be taken to protect humans, particularly those providing health care, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who have a chance to contact patients or people with infections.
The first defense line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s series number) help control virus circulation.
Surgeon masks ensure that the implantation of the tongue of the infected is not airborne or attached to the surface, where the squeezing of the tongue can continue to be carried on to others.
However, only N95 masks (the 1860s series number) that can protect against virion inhalation with a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that are stacked into one, the provider of health care that is directly related to the patient should wear N95 (the 1860s series number) and not the surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear a suitable isolation coat to further reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing N95 masks; the virus may enter his body through the eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a facial shield or glasses while working with patients.
For public society in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with infected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for quarantine themselves, and avoid contact with people with infected potentials.
Three feet are believed to be suitable for keeping a distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high-level counterparts with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to the people of China who have strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of circulation and the limited capacity of reproduction from humans to humans and prevention and relief of this disease is not a problem.
This message is very soothing to the public, especially when the whole country is preparing the half-summer festival, so that this critical time has passed to build up a small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Thailand should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the people and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to information unusually than clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials in authority; (3) more limited to spreading the potential of the epidemic at the early stages, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more often deliver targeted and effective training in order to increase public awareness of the disease epidemics and to test and strengthen the response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to burst at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Thailand and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 and SARS symptoms are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has been re-emerging.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important for the outbreak and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about older than young people and more about men than women, and the death rate is also higher than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% than 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patient transmits the virus even when they are without symptoms, while the SARS patient usually transmits the virus when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to block the COVID-19 activity than the SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA bases to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, the patients who have been cured can again have positive results on virus testing.
This finding greatly increases the risk of virus circulation.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be solved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology is found 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like CoVs, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal became the intermediate species to treat viruses from the original ants, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't cut transmissions effectively and the plague can fire back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemistry show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the breath channel cell and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Is this virus also related to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot reach a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like the flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find it.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The zoonotic source of human crown virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have motivated co-evolution of the coronary virus (CoV) and its ingenuity, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCOV) were known to cause mild disease, such as an illness.
Severe acute breathing syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern breathing syndrome (EMERS) reverse conditions and reveal how much HCOV infection can be very damaging and life threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in central Thailand at the end of 2019 has made the CoV a turning point and surprised us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonoses, so understanding of the origin of HCoV zoonotics will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats, in these animals, viruses are not pathogenic.
Some HCoV tankers have also been known.
Animal identification has a direct involvement in preventing human disease.
Investigating the interaction of the CoV-inang in animals can also give important insights into the pathogenesis of the CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCOV, focusing on its discovery history and its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
The important thing is, we compare and counteract the HCOV from the point of view of evolution and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions for the successful transfer of angina and the involvement of virus evolution in disease survival are also highlighted.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which is made up of a group of RNA viruses covering, positive inndra, and single brick.
This virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobesa among the RNA viruses called "CoV", because its morphology looks like a crown under the electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has similar settings.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open threads (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are flat-lined, both translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyprotein.
Polyprotein has further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome is made up of open reading range (ORF) for structural protein, which includes thinning or spike (S), veiling or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific complete proteins for specific lineages are also bounded by various lines of offspring of the CoV.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified as four gene (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four gene, beta-CoV has the most HCOV and is divided into four gene lines (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are the source of the gene of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while theungas is the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
So far, there are seven human coVs known.
Between the seventh virus, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute acute breathing syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Coronary Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing the infection of heavy low respiratory tract on relatively more patients and having a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
Strain HCOV-229E first, B814, isolated from swallowing patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through an in-depth study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both causing symptoms that heal themselves.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until SARS outbreaks occur.
The SARS outbreak that took place in 2003 was one of the most destructive epidemics in history today, which infected more than 8,000 people with about 10% of the gross death rate.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern Breath Syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spreads to other parts of the world.
New 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), which is next known as SARS-CoV-2, is a suicide agent with the 2019 coronary virus epidemic (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Those seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of all HCoVs from bats. On bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created an enormous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for the world and for the world.
The HCoV zoonotic tracking gives frameworks to understand the natural history, the driving power, and the limiting factor of interspecies switching.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for animal reservoirs, intermediates, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifications, which have an important implication in the prevention of future preaching.
In this review, we provide a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCOV pathogenesis.
We especially emphasize and discuss the common subject that HCOV parent viruses are usually non-pathogenic in its natural reservoir, but become pathogenic after transmission of antspecies to new birds.
We also reviewed the HCoV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
The animal coV has been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from swallowing patients with an illness, various coVs had been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last few years, seven HCOVs have been identified.
A short collection of HCOV's history in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCOV-229E was first isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was further adapted to be established on the WI-38 lung cell line.
The HCOV-229E infected patient showed symptoms of fever, including headaches, sneezing, leukemia, and throat pain, along with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial sequences in the still developing shrinking brains.
Clinical pictures of HCOV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to the infection caused by HCOV-229E, which is symptomaticly indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogen infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are scattered around the world and tend to be most broadcast during the winter in the current climate.
Usually, incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy, HCOV-229E infected patients have mild disorders.
Only a few patients with a weak immune system show severe lower respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first HCOV-related pandemic documented well in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV-found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Thailand.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which were spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super snake, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak virus burden seen on the tenth day.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myalgia, headaches, fever, leukemia, and ticking, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing disorders as further symptoms.
Lymphopenia, unusual heart function tests, and increased kinase creation is a lab disorder that is common to SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithel cell proliferation, and macrophage enhancement is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, and the kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by a sitokin storm, which can be deadly, especially in patients with weak immuneness.
The virus was first isolated from the open-ended lung biopsy of zero-patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
These viruses were initially very common to young children, older people, and patients who were weak suffering from respiratory disease.
Images of corriza, concognitiveism, fever, and common bronchiolitics are found in HCoV-NL63-related diseases.
Another independent study explains the same isolation of a male’s 8-month-old nasal specimen with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Though identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% general respiratory disease and the peak of events in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a group.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-old men who had suffered from pneumonia and bronchiolitics in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitics, HCoV-HKU1 is reported related to acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 were found worldwide, causing mild breathing disease.
The four HCOV communities have been completely adapted to humans and generally have a small likelihood of mutating into very pathogenic diseases. However, extraordinary cases have occurred for unknown reasons, as in the recent case of subtype HCOV-NL63 more virulen has been reported to cause infection of the heavy low-breath tract in Thailand.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and to continue to defend itself within humans, these HCOV virulence and pathogens also decrease.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the 60-year-old lung who had acute pneumonia and failed kidney in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, the import case with the occasional secondary use of contacts has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which has so far only occurred to MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with high case deaths, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, a back-to-date patient class of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Taiwan.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the disease of the ongoing low-breath tract infection is caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and names the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a fatality of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death of a case in Hubei, Thailand, was 4.2 per cent, while the death of a case outside Hubei was 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2 caused a heavy respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a fever, coughing, and breathing.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorders.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because high nucleotide sequence homologies, 82%, both cluster into different phylogenetic branches.
Sars-CoV-2 pathogonitis is obviously lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the fast-paced sharing of SARS-CoV-2 around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, HCOV’s incubation and duration of travel is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCOV general train.
Second, the COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture seen in HCoV Community infection, which includes mild or non-specific symptoms or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections despite a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, having similarities with HCOV community and SARS-CoV.
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity is at least as high as HCOV community.
On the other hand, decreasing the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like any other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a cess sample.
"Is SARS-CoV-2 transmission fekal-oral important, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a certain situation, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
Also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of HCOV community.
In any case, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenesis, and continuous sharing in several pathways in humans, will have a profound impact on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCOV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be the species of HCOV pandemics in the past.
HCOV that causes serious illness to humans and humans who suffer from severe HCOV has been wiped out.
For this to happen, HCOV has to replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to fight the animal limitation factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague survives and more people are infected, the more likely this virus is to be fully humanized.
If the virus adapts well, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four CoV communities have been moving into human populations and triggering an immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is highly pathogenic, are not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be defended.
Both of them have to defend themselves and raise zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediators and amplifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV community and is not as pathogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Still to be seen if SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and swirled into humans without any animal reservoirs or intermediaries.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, we need to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as HCOV's evolutionary angel if they have close relatives and share high homology at a nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this animal.
Likewise, the reservoir nest carries HCOV continuously and in a long period of time.
In both cases, the animal is naturally infected and is a natural animal for HCOV or the parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the intermediate anthem just before or around the time of the virus entry into humans, the virus has not been adapted to the new and often pathogenic animals.
This intermediary may function as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as an amphetizer by allowing the virus to be temporarily applied, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCOV may have a fatal infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to intermittent influences and even cause long-term endocity.
In this case, the intercom is a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with wild animals.
Further study of seroprevalence indicates that the animal salesman has a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Musang lunar (Paguma larvata) and dog raccoon at the living animal market is the first time identified with similar-SARS-CoV viruses that are almost identical with SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the rubble on the market was killed.
Nevertheless, it is reported that the moon owls of the wild or undisclosed nature to the living animal market most of the results are negative tests for SARS-CoV. This implies that the moon owls may only act as an interminary appreciation lamb, but not a natural SARS-CoV resorption.
It needs to be noted, since 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it can't be ruled out that many small mammal species may also function as an between SARS-CoV appreciation.
All these animals seem to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The search for natural animals for SARS-CoV next reveals the near-bred bat CoV, which is called the Rhinolopus bat relatives of SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found on the bat on the Tinokok horse's foot bat.
This bat gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This CoV and the other CoV bat share nucleotide-compliant homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the basis for the new concept that bats are an angel for new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV) are also identified by bats, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as living viruses.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from the bat's ferret sample was shown to use ACE2 bats, owls, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interesting thing, convalesen SARS serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents an ancestor who is closest to SARS-CoV on bats, with a 95 percent nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite its high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same animal receptor, which is peptide 4-peptide (DPP4), as a way into the virus.
The sequence of polymerase RNA depends-RNA MERS-CoV phylogenetically closer to its balance in beta-CoV bat identified by Europe and Africa.
Until now, there's no living MERS-CoV found in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats only share 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct container for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a study in the Middle East showed that Arab camels produced seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralized MERS-CoV, just like Central Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nose of the Arab camel. This indicates further that the camel is a real reservoir for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive virus delivery with symptoms that are usually mildly observed in the test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, the infected camels spread the virus not only through the breathing route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the bat's virus.
However, the question is still not answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms, possibly due to unknown human-human transmission or transmission route involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV bat RaTG13 isolated from bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be inang immediate reservoir SARS-CoV-2, unless CoV bats that are almost identical were found in later days.
Possibly, SARS-CoV-2 animals are among the species of wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Food Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates the possibility of humane transmission.
Some of the latest studies based on meta-nomical sequences show that a small group of mammals that are threatened with extinction, known as treggling (javanics), may also carry beta-CoV ancestors who are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new CoV strain shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as close as the RaTG13 with a 90% equivalent at a nucleotide sequence level.
Both are grouped into two sub-line viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees, one of which shares a more similar domain of receptor binding (RBD) than SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence equal to 97.4%.
Which is striking, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are much more different, despite the consistent level of homology of the entire genome.
Previous study in sick trecelling also reported detection of the viral contiguous from lung samples, which also resulted in association with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of translation and manual hard work to produce a sequence of partial genomes made up of about 86.3% complete virus genomes.
We can't rule out the possibility of twirling as one of the Sars-CoV-2 animals.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from treggling due to the consequent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tangling.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways on bats, tremors, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tregging, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 shared the highest homology at the same level as the entire genome.
Too much speculation if it is said that the level of similarity between the relative RBD beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 twirling and the SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the convergence evolutions that are selective in the vicinity.
The comparison hypothesis supports the recombination between the beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 treggling and the RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an evolutionary factor, many recombinations occur between beta-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide on the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin.
Besides the highly pathogenic HCOV, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 has also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may originate from bat coV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in predators.
It is reported that the coV bat called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected on the bat three colors of North America showed close proximity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E genetically cohabited with the other bat CoV, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also suspected to be the intermediary.
To be clearer, the current knowledge of the origin of the HCOV animals is summarized in Figures 1 and Table 2.
phylogenetic analysis has shown evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of livestock to infect humans, it was recorded that there was a pandemic of respiratory infection.
History of HCOV-229E interspecies transmission is not very clear.
Alfa-CoV bats associated with HCOV-229E have been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of viruses from bats to humans.
First, humans, not the alpacas, may be in contact with bats in the cologne of ecology.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the Alps.
Second, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCOV-229E are various and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the alpaca may have alpha-CoV relatives-HCOV-229E from humans cannot be sidelined.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while alpha-CoV bats function as a long-range HCOV-229E gene, the alpaca and Arab camels may function as an intermediary animal that transmits viruses to humans, just like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for transmitting interspecies from bats to Arab camels and Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary sources of MERS-CoV of bats are known in early virus identification and are also strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich virus species long for the interspecies and interspecies transmission of genetic fragments.
A long age, a colony set up together, a close social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all are conditions that support bats to be an ideal 'virus preacher'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the camel that has changed from the internatrician angina into a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and preserves the relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
His sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and man remains the ultimate enemy for MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike a camel's role in MERS-CoV transmission, a transfer role, if any, in a different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Especially, beta-CoV trellising is highly pathogenic in trelling.
Calling may be the ultimate enemy for beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, similar to weed in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be counted or excluded.
First, bats could be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological extensions with bats through logging or mining coal.
Second, tremoring could be one of the interminor applifications for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get viruses through slaughter and consumption of burrowed meat.
Perhaps, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies survey of pets and wild animals have to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that interacts both with bats and tremors.
The SARS-CoV-2 animal search is still ongoing.
Despite animal species, three main factors on the virus side are also important to make CoV easier to cross species barriers.
First, the rate of mutation is relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-band RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutation can be considered as "current" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per step, depending on the CoV adaptation phase against new animals.
CoV has exoribonuklease corrections, removals that result in very high mutations, attenuations, or even incapacities.
Interesting, analog remdesivir nucleotide is known to press CoV replication by inhibiting these exoribunukleases and RNA polymerase depends on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of the CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its mutation.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when CoV has not adapted with an angel.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, indicating higher adaptation levels with humans.
It's possible that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another animal that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, the small possibility that genetic decay will quickly cause vaccines and anti-virus agents against SARS-CoV-2 to become ineffective.
Second, a large RNA genome in the CoV gives extra flexibility in the modification of the genome, for mutation and recombination, so that it increases the probability of interspecies co-evolutionary, which benefits to appear new CoV when appropriate.
This is supported by a number of open-read sequences and protein functions that are mapped to the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoV often changes templates randomly during RNA replication through unique "choice-salien" mechanisms.
In an animal that acts as a mixing vessel, the transfer of camels often occurs during the RNA CoV transcription.
Full RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can be recombined to form new CoV.
Natural phylogenetic evidence of recombination has been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as on animal coVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-inang interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with anang receptors is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and owls, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various animals, especially with mutations on S protein RBD.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively becomes the target response of an antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid from 318 to 510 on S1, which is related to human ACE2 and its corresector as a way into the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, owls, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing transmission of the interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed are different between human virus isolates and owls in RBD and 4 of them located on receptor binding motives for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of human ACE2 human protein interaction.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for adapting the virus to humans.
Need to note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at S1 protein S unit involved the affinity of S protein binding with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity of human ACE2 binding and S SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher protein compared to the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV protein.
Also important to know is whether there are any other correlations that may be required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 also connects with ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There's a lot of other HCOV receptors, like aminopeptidases N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-teraethylase acid for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies of the animal.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of HCoV interspecies transmissions is also regulated by other factors of dependence and limitations.
The difference between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and predators, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV should take over the factors of angel dependence and break down the animal limitation factor in order to succeed in the interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in the area of these important viruses interaction still have to be identified and described.
The full range of genes is priceless to see the factors of dependence and the limitations of the SARS-CoV-2 animal using the most sophisticated CRISPR technology might be beneficial.
New HCOV appearance: back to the beginning of the plague
CoV crew gave the bat a great opportunity for the new HCOV to appear.
In this case, the bat's coV functioned as a long-range HCOV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations also motivate HCOV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, winning or losing a new protein-containing gene potentially modifying virus phenotypes drastically.
Among the SARS-CoV protein accessors, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in human adaptation because of the SARS-CoV relative bat virus found in isolation in various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a typical trait of elimination of 29 nucleotide found on an isolated strain at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The removal separates the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation supporting the transfer of the lamb.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineage, with a large number of smaller recommendation areas identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination locations are also identified at nsp9, mostly nsp10, and part nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination between the genera shown was carried out in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination has also been observed in other HCOVs where HCOV experiences recombination with other coV animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, likely due to the release of viruses from the stress of the selected selection, such as the immune animal system.
The example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the foreign prototype HCOV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows single nucleotide patterns that result in range displacement.
Finally, the new HCOV evolution is also driven by the pressure of selection in the nest of the reservoir.
Mild or untimely symptoms are detected when the bat is infected with CoV, which shows the different adaptations between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats adapt well with CoV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, failure in the activation of proinflammatory response to bats will reduce the pathology triggered by CoV efficiently.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells on bats is pressed by increased regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 shock absorber and the level of molecular expression complex histocompatibilities main low-class I.
In addition, high levels of oxygen reactive (ROS) species of high bat metabolic activity can push the CoV replicate and influence correction by exoribonukleasing so that it puts a selection pressure on the generation of a highly pathogenic foreign virus when entering the new nest.
A more pathogenic strain of CoV may also develop through recombination, which results in protein gain or new protein features for animal adaptation.
Therefore, it's not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two bases.
CoV is non-pathogenic or causes mild symptoms in the nest of the reservoir, such as bats and camels.
The CoV replicates strongly without triggering a powerful immune response.
Here lies the secret of the untimely carrier and the cause of heavy cases of human infection.
The major symptoms are due to excessive immune response activation and sitokin storms, with increased lung damage if the immune response becomes stronger.
On the other hand, on the carrier without symptoms, immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the connection of immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are especially strong on bats.
Therefore, interferon type I gift, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of NLP3 on bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibiting the inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the handling of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appearance follows the general flow of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also coV bats that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Even though other Husbands and animals in the market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the direct intermediary for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV transfering which is very similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that treggling may play as one of the intermediates or beta-CoV treggling may contribute the gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Even if still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
The CoV is back to focus because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies on bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCOV in human transmission.
There's a lot of evidence to show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats and is transmitted to humans through the intercom.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and owls in the wet market, perhaps wet market closures and killings of all wetlands in it that effectively end SARS epidemics.
For the same reason, the transfer should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the existence of the discovery of some beta-CoV transfer line relatives close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms are transmitted to humans through tremoring and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for a long time.
These camels function as important transport tools and as the main source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all camels to control MERS, as done at the wild animal market in Thailand to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genotypes can emerge and cause a plague.
The various zoonotic coVs are leaving in the wild.
Especially, the coV bat with zoonotic potential is very diverse.
There is a lot of possibility for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and undergo recombination, which leads to the emergence of a new coV that is easier to transmit and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
Culturally eating wild animals in some places in Thailand was to be left to reduce unnecessary contact with humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better planning and preparation must be implemented.
Actually, a lot of viruses have been on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of viruses, the human opportunity to interact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are driven to avoid wild animals.
Continued surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the CoV ecology and its natural creatures, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and coming pestilences.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonoses from viruses is to keep the distance from ecological reservoir relays of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzles have not been found.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus to twitching, the condition when bats and transgilling share ecological extensions is an important thing to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, human contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that plays an actual intermediary, how it interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and tremors must be explained.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both tests and surveillance infections must be done.
Either bats, tremors, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that is almost identical can be identified in its future natural memory.
Further research in this field will describe the evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 pathway in animals, with an important implication in prevention and control of the COVID-19 in humans.
Update the diagnostic criteria "invented case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 must be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for diagnosis and management of new 2019 choronavirus infections (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to combating pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, the 2019 choronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, awareness and knowledge that is growing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "the expected case" and "the confirmed case" based on the Diagnostic and Management Guide for the COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of the Republic of Taiwan.
In December 2019, the new 2019 koronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a plague, which is now formally called the 2019 koronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed the quick advice guide and the guidance was published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
These guidelines have drawn much attention to the way we have been published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge that is growing based on ongoing research and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
As an example of the Diagnostic and Management Guide for the COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of the Republic of Turkey (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has produced a total of seven editions with some contexts have changed considerably.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal for simple scores based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and makes a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also required an update based on the Diagnostic and Management Guide for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case, a combination of one of the epidemiological history images with two clinical manifestations is required to make comprehensive analysis, or to perform three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or stay in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 communicable cases (with positive nuclear acid tests); (3) contact with patients who have fever or symptoms of breathing from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other community where the COVID-19 case was reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) contact with confirmed case classification (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or breathing symptoms occurring in two weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or breathing symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) total white blood count shows normal lymphocyte counts, decreases, or decreases in the initial awning stages.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequences of the whole genome virus show high homogeneity for known new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or change of the specific IgG-CoV-2 antibody from negative to positive, or titer increases ≥4 fold at recovery stage above acute phase.
We can see that the real-time nuclear acid PCR test in the sample of the air or blood can be added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence added to the seventh edition.
This amendment is based on continued research of researchers to search for optimal nuclear acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the breathing channel including blood removal, which enhances the availability of various specimens, and supports the provision of specific positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there is more evidence that reminds us to guard patients with symptoms of atticism and with no symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. wing chart must be updated because they classify a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the future.
As a closet, we hope that more immediate evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
To diagnose "the expected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend following and obeying the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance on occasion as a help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 home-based healed cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In an online news release, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death covered four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of those who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Maitree's Kuwaiti Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video online announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridge, the Obuidul Quader said public transport would be stopped longer than planned, until Saturday would come.
This public transportation stop has begun since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of items -- medical supplies, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two new arrivals from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronary virus.
The climax occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia experienced its first death related to the coronary virus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries that remained free of the infection of the crown virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 cases of coronary viruses, which result in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News Office reports, which includes data Johns Hopkins University, there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronary virus infection.
All over the world, countries are announcing a stronger action to curb disease spread.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine area until May 1st.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament took a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was won by 215 votes in support, ten abstinent votes, and one vote was refused.
Saudi Arabia extended hours at night in the sacred city of Mecca and Madinah all day long; before, it occurred only between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to apply the night between 10:00 and 4:00 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its domestic order until May 1st.
Australia's store store lowers the purchase limit of toilet tissue per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, the Australian Woolworth and Coles network each lowers the limits of the purchase of toilet tissue up to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one sir, on Monday.
This limitation is announced as a message in the mailbox and on the network's Facebook page.
The buyers are reported to build up supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 if the community should do independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet tissue for shipments to the house up to one pack per order.
This change follows the limitation of four packs per transaction previously applied Woolworths and Coles each on March 4 and 5.
In his statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the bullying of the four packs, "many stores are still running out in an hour since the delivery", and called that request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sales of "higher sharp" last week, according to one of Woolworths' speakers.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number allowed up to two packs last week.
To avoid a shortage, Coles ordered more packaging than the supplier and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made provision for special Wednesday’s activity available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Oil Association, said that the oil was trying to increase the supply, but the local government's body limits for the time delivery of the truck made it difficult.
He anticipates rising production costs, while suppliers seek to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since it had taken off supplies earlier, some stores could not do special Wednesday.
In a report News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a ritual expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled supplies every night.
He stressed that the toilet tissue was a large-volume material so that the amount of supplies was low and, if sold, made a lot of empty space in the shelves so that the quantity of the goods became more expensive.
Coles and Woolworths agree [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet tissue and service can be [bought] and there's a large amount, panic may be minimized, russel Zimmerman's drain through the ABC News Office.
The producer of toilet paper recycle Who Gives a Crap says on Wednesday that they're out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who created the Kleinex Toilet Fabric, and Solaris Paper, who made the Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some property salesmen offer free toilet paper to the first auction dealer in Melbourne, when less auctions are held because the buyer takes a break for long weekend holidays.
Thursday's NT News edition, a newspaper printed in Darwin, includes eight pages intended to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The shops actually refused to apply the limits, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3rd, they said that they were not planning to apply the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, semantics, dry foods, handwashed soap, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British supermarket Ocado was observed to limit the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 scrolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the current COVID-19 outbreak—disease caused by the coronovirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how many diseases have spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the state detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, it will teach Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very concerned about the level of preaching and the fearsome famines, as well as about the fear - inspiring gait of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center of Control and Prevention of Sickness, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there was no breathing virus ever traced from its appearance to the continued global preaching."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of affairs followed the decision of the WHO in January that declared this plague as a result of the ill health of the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the point is, this plague will get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, which resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 choronavirus pandemic is the 2019 choronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) which is continuing and caused by the 2 (SARS-CoV-2) acute breathing syndrome.
The plague was identified in Wuhan, Thailand, in December 2019, as a Worldly Degrading Health Disease on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Taiwan, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
Time from the date of appearance to the symptoms in general about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive action includes washing hands, closing mouths when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolation alone for those suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by doing travel, quarantine, nighttime, hazardous workplace control, and the closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global economic social unrest, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and widespread supply of goods that are being subjected to panic purchase.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
The misinformation about this virus has spread online and there is an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with offspring and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from the area with significant cases of viruses.
As a result of heavy travel and industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decrease.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Thailand (the home of Hubei Province), reported a class of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and investigated in early January 2020.
Those cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Grosir Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the plague called SARS-CoV-2, the newly discovered virus and associated with the bat's coronavirus, the coronavirus rolling, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with the symptoms was then known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person does not have a clear connection with the later mentioned wet market class.
Among the early case classes reported in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, on a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, was likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case being reported down in Thailand, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of Thailand had exceeded the number of new cases in the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until 26 February, relatively few cases reported among young people, with people 19 years of age under forming 2.4% cases around the world. The head of British scientific advisor Raya, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the English population needs to be infected before the immunity of the group can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and the results of the tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies to avoid testing people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Thailand, until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported case.
The initial estimate of the base reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Control and Prevention of Sickness concluded that the number is possible 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients were cured.
For those who do not recover, time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, some 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In Thailand, until February 5, about 80% of the deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had previous health disorders, which included cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, considering that the official numbers may not include people who died without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count with factor 4-5 times fold.
A female spokesperson for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number," a statement strengthened by a non-profit report on too low estimates in the U.S.. too low often appears in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Thailand occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
By February 28th, outside of Newfoundland, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported death, on every continent, except Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population character such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of death to case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified period of time.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, the overall death rate against the case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by 10 April 2020.
This number varies depending on the region.
In Thailand, the estimated death rate against the case falls from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after February 1, 2020).Another increase includes the number of fatalities of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who died of certain diseases, and the number of fatalities of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosis and undiagnosed) who died of certain diseases.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of fatalities of infection for the whole pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of the first random testing for the COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyses the impact of the CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The top and end of this plague is unclear and may be different according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, "Without control, a contagious plague usually takes place and then begins to deteriorate when the disease runs out of the available angel.
However, it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection right now about when it happens."
Senior medical advisor to the government of Tiokh Zhong Nanshan said that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on the rare steps to stop virus circulation.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly up to one or two years."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical limitation and other steps will be needed "until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easily transmitted, can completely disappear" and this disease "maybe turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The repeat virulence will depend on group immunity and mutation level.
The COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and the infected person can be without symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
A rare symptoms include fatigue, the production of breathing sputum (flegma), the loss of smelling, breathing, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headache, ticking, vomiting, hemopsis, diarrhoea, or insensity.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms that include breathing difficulties, chest stress or chest pain, sudden restlessness, difficulty walking, and blueness on face and lips; medical attention is immediately recommended if these symptoms occur. Further development of disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confirmed infected should be monitored closely and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate asymptomatic ratios ranged from a few to 44%.
The period of incubation (time between infection and symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, for example, the estimated number of patients with COVID-19 who lost their initial sense of smell was 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Details of how this disease is spreading are still being examined.
The COVID-19 distribution is primarily believed to occur during close contact and through a small droplet produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that uncovered cough can cause droplets of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking. Breath droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of the person near it or maybe breathe into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can make breathing secretes turn into aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also be done by touching a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the physiques, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of Thailand is viewing the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at a further stage of disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms, which indicate transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few asymptomatic reports confirmed laboratoryly, but asymtomatic transmissions have been identified by some countries during a contact search.
The Center for Prevention and Control of European Diseases (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two or three others.
Specifically, it was found that viruses can be detected up to three days in plastics (polypropylen) and 304 steel, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authority suggests washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that might have been touched by infected people.
Coronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three patients with pneumonia related to the classification of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are associated with coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it has home soap, which routed the protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is close to initial SARS-CoV.
The virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (b line of offspring) along with two bat - descended galars.
This virus has a 96% similarity in the whole genome with another bat's coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researchers Tionghoa discovered that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome between the virus and the human virus.
Until now, the comparison of the entire genome found most 92% of the genetics of coronavirus dialing and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that it is an enemy between SARS-CoV-2.
Virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is finally done through the reaction of back-to-back polymerase chains (rRT-PCR) to an infected secret or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the number of imaging features that tend to be inundated with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
Test using real-time (rRT-PCR) back-encrypted polymerase chain reaction.
Testing can be done on a breathing sample or blood sample.
The results are generally available in hours to days.
Generally, this test is done on the nasopharynx, but the throat valve can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
By 6 April 2020, no one of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its use widely.
In the U.S., Cellex's serological tests have been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic feature of the computed X-ray and CT imaging feature in a symptomatic person includes the depth glass opacity of the asymmetrical periphery and no pleura efusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is building an international network database for the finding of imaging on confirmed cases.
Because it is thin with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificities in identifying COVID-19.
A major research in Thailand compares breast CT results with PCR and shows that although not specific for infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so that it is recommended to be considered as a capitulation tool in the epidemic area.
The artificial intelligence-based neural network of conspiracy has been developed to detect virus capture features with X-rays and CT.
The strategy for preventing the spread of this disease includes keeping personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and using tissue when coughing or sin and immediately throwing tissue into a trash can.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
It is also recommended that physical restraints be avoided, and the government in various regions has restricted or led to halt all non-essential travels to and from affected countries.
However, the virus has reached the scale of public awareness in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Providers of health care that handles people who may be infected are advised to do standard precautions, contact prevention actions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The use of the location data from the government's cell phone for this purpose has triggered privacy issues, with the outcome of the statement by Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for such surveillance restrictions.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance to another phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19.Leave a misunderstanding on how to prevent infection; for example, brushing their noses and muttering with ineffective
There's no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands was encouraged to prevent disease from spreading.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after spraying their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by home soap that damaged its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand service with at least 60% alcohol based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, noses, or mouths before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of laminates (in one minute disinfection for the surface of solid steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other types, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine, are not effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are any expected or confirmed COVID cases at the public facility, such as offices or childcare facilities, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablets, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the sufferers, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with nails that are crushed or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then quickly throw away tissue.
Surgeon masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because using masks can limit volume and length of expiratory droplets that are distributed during speech, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on time and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch faces with insufficiently clean hands, which is the main source of infection."Masker is also recommended to be used by people who may be suffering from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medicine masks made of cloth. The Chinese specifically recommended the use of medical masks once used to healthy society, especially when close to (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommended wearing surgical masks when using public transportation or living in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned the public from leaving their homes without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear masks when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government forced everyone who entered the toserba to wear a mask.
Israel asked all his citizens to wear masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid - March, requires train passengers and city buses to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the house, and recommends the production of fabric masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitation (also called physical limitation) is an infection control action intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social restraints include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restrictions by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding public areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping a physical distance from others.
At this time, many governments are forced to or do social restrictions in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations were quickly reduced, starting with 250 people (if they did not know there was a COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibits meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Age and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disruptive immune systems that have a risk of serious illness and higher complications are recommended to the CDC as much as possible at home as possible in areas where there is a disease in society. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies have begun to change the use of the term "social restriction" into "physical limitation", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, whether in a virtual way or from a distance.
The use of the term "social limitation" suggests that people must isolate themselves completely socially and do not encourage people to keep in touch with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This recommendation includes an encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have viruses or symptoms of viruses.
The isolation of the individual in the home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation. Many governments are required or recommending independent quarantines for all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest self-certified quarantine instruction is issued to people who are at high risk.
The people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and the people who have recently traveled to the country or region with extensive COVID-19 circulation are advised to do quarantine alone for 14 days since the last possible settlement.
The strategy in the control of the epidemic is support or suppression, and mitigation.
Protection is carried out at the early stage of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control the infection and vaccine intended to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to halt the spread of disease, the next effort moves to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow the preaching and reduce the impact on the health care system and the community.
Combination of backup and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.
This lowers the risk of failure in health care and gives more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the plague involves the actions of individual prevention, such as hand-cleaning, wearing masks, and self-sustaining quarantine; steps at the level of society aimed at physical limitation, such as closing the school and canceling the mass meeting; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as cleaning of the surface.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduces local mass coverage and quarantine, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected person who does the independent quarantine and wears a large fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of facial masks and punished medically available farmers. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slow, but does not stop the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the peak of demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but it still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and a overwhelmed health system.
The suppression can be selected, but it needs to be held as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if it is first reached), because otherwise, the infection will bounce back quickly as the suppression steps are withheld.
Long-term intervention to pressure the pandemic has an impact on social and economic conditions.
There is no specific antivirus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is under way, including an existing drug test.
Taking free selling drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depends on the level of resistance, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and breathing support may be required.
Steroid use can make the patient's condition worse.
Some of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viruses are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and house-to-house fights" can reduce symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is a basic step in responding to the disease.
The ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources from various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive patients COVID-19, and increase intensive care capacity by training personnel and increase the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called the patient zero).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiokh.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei rose gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A classer pneumonia with an unknown cause observed on December 26th and handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, who informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police because they were spreading false villages, and others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his superiors for the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31st and told WHO.
Quite a number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan that then triggered an investigation in early January. At the early stage of the outbreak, the number of cases increased twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of Thailand, supported by migration during the New Year's Ille and because Wuhan is the hub of transport and main railway transit.
On January 20, Thailand reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The official data below shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.On March 26, the United States has exceeded Turkey and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Region restrict free movement and control the borders.
On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some 40% of the region in the United States, over 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in the region in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some kind of quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest case on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed the classification of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 26th; this observation was reported to the CDC Jianghan on December 27th.
The early genetic testing of patients' samples on December 27, 2019 indicated that there was a similar SARS-like coronavirus.

WHO commends the government’s efforts in managing and strengthening the epidemics.
WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004 when the authorities of Thailand were accused of closing the doors so as to prevent the efforts of prevention and relief and the current crisis with the central government "gives a routine update to avoid panic over the New Year's Illesques".
On 23 January, as a response to the central government's decision to implement the ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea said that although it was "clearly not the WHO recommendation," but it was also "a very important indication for the commitment to the outbreak of epidemics in the most concentrated place of the plague" and he called it "never before in the history of public health."On 30 January, after the confirmation of human migration to people outside of Thailand and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared this outbreak as a People's Health Disorder that Detains the World (PHEIC), which is the sixth PHEIC since that step was first carried out during the 2009 pig flu pandemic.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom says that PHEIC is stated because of the "risk of global preaching, especially to low- and middle-sized countries that do not have a poor health system.
Responding to travel limitation, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take steps that interfere with international travel and trade unnecessarily" and " WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."

This virus may come to your place and you must be ready," and insist that proper roll-over can help the world avoid "the worst".

On March 11, WHO declared the cronavirus plague as a pandemic.
Director General WHO says that WHO "is very concerned about the level of preaching and anxiety, as well as the level of grassroots action that worries."

A number of provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CCP) were discontinued from the management of quarantine efforts in Central Thailand, which was a sign of dissatisfaction with the political response of the political agency to the problem in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Tiokkok Xi Jinping from public anger related to the coronary heart disease.
Some officials in Thailand, such as Zhao Lijian, had rejected previous confessions of the coronovirus outbreak in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 came from the United States or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as "Tiongkok virus" or "Wihan virus" and said that "Tiongkok's cover-up act gives power to the virus that is now turned into a global pandemic."

Of course, this is no sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Russian soldiers to send military medical personnel, vehicles with special disinfection, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes "high-level political sources" anonymously saying that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or is of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of an exciting "geopolitic and diplomatic" attack.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mai ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo aircraft with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin Dmitry Peskov's spokesman said that "when offering help to fellows in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if the U.S. equipment and medicine producers get a chance, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign Nuclear Weapons Development Kate Hudson criticises Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of the U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also the people of the countries where they operate."The Iranian government is deeply affected by this virus, with about two dozen members of the parliament infected with five political figures now or before.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting the plague because of the lack of access to the international market as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. This has prompted the United States to adopt public social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family pay leave, and higher funding levels for the health of the community.
Political analysts suspect that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chance to be re-elected in President 2020's election. The diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea is worse because of this pandemic.
South Korea criticises "the ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that every person coming from South Korea will be placed in quarantine two weeks at a designated government location.
At first, South Korea's views were divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans sign petition, either call for Moon's judgement, based on their claims of government failure in dealing with the plague, or commend its response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable the government to strengthen its power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule through time-bound decrees, postpone parliament and public elections, and punish those deemed to be spreading false information about viruses and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus outbreak was studied in cases of supply shortages, which stemmed from an increase in the use of equipment globally to combat the plague, the purchase of panic, and the disruption of plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Drug and Food Supervisor is warning about the lack of drugs and medical equipment as a result of increased demand for consumers and food disruptions.
Some areas also have a purchase because panic causes a lack of basic necessities, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, triggering supply shortages.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in sending electronics.
According to general director of WHO Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection has risen 100 times.
This request led to an increase in the price of up to twenty times the normal price and triggers a postponement of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also causes a lack of protection worldwide, and WHO warns that this will endanger health.
In Australia, a pandemic opened up a new opportunity for digou buyers to sell Australian products in Turkey.
This activity led to the shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite its high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and Wuhan regions, and its high demand for food products, these two areas were prevented from food shortages.
The steps of Turkey and Italy in combating the development and illegal trade of important products have succeeded in making the food shortage anticipated in Europe and North America to be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not yet experienced declines, but prices can increase according to industrial representation.
Empty food racks are only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, along with government officials in the country of Turkey, taking off pork supplies to ensure a sufficient amount of society.
Similar invitations also exist in Italy, which requires food producers to store spare parts for such emergencies.
The global economic decline has been felt in Thailand: According to a media report on March 16, the economy in Thailand was severely beaten in the first two months of 2020 by the steps taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus, and the sale of anjlocus rituals of 20.5%.
Because the land is the economic center and major manufacturing, the virus is considered to pose a major threat to global economic destabilization.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain in motion until there is a clearer picture of the potential outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004.
An estimate of the Washington University expert at St. Louis stated that the plague had an impact of over $300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Earth's Oil Exporters (OPEC) is reported as a "pears" after the oil price of the earth has fallen sharply as a result of its reduced demand from Turkey.

Tourism is one of the worst - hit sectors because of the ban on travel, the closure of public places including tourist sites, and government action that restricts travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights because of a slight demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British Flybe regional airlines collapsed.
The impact on the navigational industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic is closely related to Chunyun, the main season of travel related to New Year's Eve Ille.
A number of events involving many people were canceled by the central government and the area, including annual New Year's Eve festivals, and private companies were also alone closing shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Easter New Year’s events and tourist tours were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple display.
In 24 out of 31 provinces, the city of the state, and the region of Thailand, the authorities extended their New Year’s holiday to February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These districts are 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong increased the release of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency, closed school until March, and canceled New Year's celebrations.
Visits to European and Latin America drop by 40 percent.
North American and Middle Eastern censors are down 50–60%.
It also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in road traffic to the shopping center of March compared to February.
The global shopping center operator is doing additional steps, such as an increase in sanitation, the installation of thermal scanners to check the buyer's temperature, and the cancellation of the event.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, some 5 million people in Turkey lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million migrant workers in the country of Thailand are housed in the province of the country or trapped in the province of Hubei. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimate, the koronavirus outbreak can cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment levels to 32%. The 40th region of India has resulted in tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily wages). A survey of Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have lost some work. Almost 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since it was done 40% of the region in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers made temporary unemployment payments and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme.
German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the arts and cultural heritage sector is deeply affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and self - employed.
The art and culture sector organization strives to support their mission (often funded by the public) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, to maintain employees and society's safety, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, shows, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, shows, shows, and shows either canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through a digital platform. The impact of this new and rapidly developing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and dressmaking.
The film industry was also disrupted. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week in Rome, which fell during the last week of Christian repentance, was canceled.
Many churchgoers encourage Christian age to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, live broadcasts or television, while others offer a drive-in or a grandeur.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic church and chapel and the expulsion of the Holy Peter from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restricted public meetings in the church, mosques, synagogues, temples, and hurrahs.
Iran's Ministry of Health announces the cancellation of prayers on Friday in a place of plague and the places of worship closed, while Saudi Arabia forbids the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants into sacred places in Mekah and Medinah.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events are cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the NHL 2019-2020 season.
This plague is ruining the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "rescheduled until after 2020, but will not be more than summer 2021."All over the world, casinos and other games are closed and direct broadcasts of poker tournaments are delayed or cancelled.
This has caused many players to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant new increase in registration, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands delaying or canceling concert tours.
Lots of big theaters like Broadway also postpone all the shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative to traditional direct performances, such as online live concert or making web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many use the Internet with coronavirus to spread online with many people who turn to humor and distractions in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague, it has been noted that there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the descendants of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Thailand) record racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoa people deserve to receive viruses or accept what they claim as a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiokh sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on account of their region.
There's already support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for the people in the affected areas.
Supporting the development of outbreaks to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe with serious COVID-19 outbreaks, can also be a target of suspicion and xenophobia. People in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially sign a petition to ban Tionghoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan became a train on Twitter.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported an increase in racist and assault harassment.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus "Virus Tiokkokkok", a term that critics considered to be racist and anti-Tiokkok.

Laboratory testing for 2019 choronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects the presence of viruses and detects the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects the RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus only.
This test is used to confirm new or still active infections.
Antibodi detection (serology) can be used for the diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibodies tests show the number of people who have already been infected, including those who are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and the level of immunity of the population can be determined from this test.
Because of the limited testing, until March 2020, no country has any actual data on the prevalence of viruses in its population.
By March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a wide variation in the number of testing countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of real-time transcription polymerase chains (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on a breathing sample obtained by various methods, including a nasopharynx or sputum sample.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the throat valve can only be relied upon in the first week of the disease.
Eventually, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the infected people tested in the second week, the sample can be taken from the deep breath channel by using either isap catheters or substances that can be used through cough.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the reaction of real-time transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
British Raya also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-CoV-2 PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) detection device, which was on January 28, 2020.
This device looks for the "E" gene that has all the beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene that is specific for SARS-CoV-2.In Tokyo, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency approvals from the National Medical Product Administration in China for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection device. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel to the public health laboratory through International Reagent Resource.
One out of three genetic tests in the old version test equipment yields unconvinced results due to the failure of the reaction, and the number of tests in the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components considered to be unreliable until February 28, 2020, and just after that the state laboratory and the local laboratory are allowed to perform tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Drug and Food Supervisor based on the Emergency Use Authorisation.
By March 5, 2020, LabCorp announces the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 test available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be carried out within 3.5 hours with a high volume so that a machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisations to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to Holic, LabCorp, and Thermal Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using technology amplifying isothermal nuclear acid that is not PCR.
Since there is no need for a series of temperature change cycles, this method can yield positive results only within five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipate to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind new kronovirus proteins (N protein) to Taiwan, hopefully can yield results within 15 to 20 minutes like rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photo chests have a small diagnostic value at the early stage, as well as finding CT [computed tomography] may have existed before the onset of symptoms."
Special features on CT include bilateral multilobar depth-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura domination, crazy Paving, and consolidation are formed as disease develops.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the current pandemic point showed that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, although not specific, with many multiple multiple multiple imaging features tending with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19."By March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for the early one.
The part of the immune response to infection is an antibody determination that includes IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals for about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity from disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care test (POC).
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out this examination, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune response.
For PoCT, a peripheral blood specimen was generally used through skin bites.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction does not require prior to examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notification to the agency as needed and therefore can now distribute their anti-bodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on the authorisation of emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their IgG and IgA antibody detection devices against viruses in blood samples.
The ability to test up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the poisoning infection. Early in April, the British Raya found that not one of the antibodies they bought was good enough to use.
Hong Kong set up a scheme for the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a specimen tube," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. NHS England announced that NHS is pioneering the expected case testing scheme at home so that it will eliminate the risk of other patients treating others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect ambulances if used. In the upstairs testing for suspected case COVID-19, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate preventive action.
On March 2, the National Association of Regulations Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests a day in road patrol orders and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance if the test is requested by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany had a total of 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19, tests performed in several large cities.
By March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey reveals that at least 483.295 samples have been tested to and from weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, by merging samples and only testing further if the sample was found to be positive. In Wuhan, the emergency survey laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Mandwarin: ★, or "Fireeye" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction monitored by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and it took 5 days, the modeling showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine management could double if this test capacity did not exist.
Wuhan Laboratory soon followed by Huo-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout Thailand.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. Open source design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 samples of patients for COVID-19 by using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without requiring robotic fluid handling.
By March, insufficient shortages and reagenities had become a challenge to mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are attempting to explore the sampling protocol involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirates was reported to do more testing of coronavirus per population than any country, and is prepared to increase the testing scale to reach most populations.
This is achieved through a combination of survey and mass-scale laboratory procurement of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in Thailand).
Built in 14 days, this lab is able to do tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of Thailand.
Various testing recipes targeting various sections of coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in Taiwan, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted German prescriptions for the production of testing devices sent to low-quality countries without any resources to develop itself.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; a protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until January 28 until it slowed down the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak, Tiokh and the United States had a problem with the use of test equipment; these two countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet their demands and recommendations for health testing.
On the contrary, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the new choronavirus.
The ability to test, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow down the increase in the COVID-19 pandemic. High demands for testing because of the widespread spread of viruses caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for testing in the U.S. private laboratory, and the supply of tools and chemical reagents became critical.
In March 2020, Thailand reported an accuracy problem on their test equipment.
In the United States, the test equipment developed by the CDC has "deficit"; the government then removes the bureaucratic obstacle that prevents testing by private. Spanish buys test equipment from the company Tionkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the results are not accurate.
The company explained that poor results may result from failure to collect samples or from using test equipment properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would pull out the equipment that would produce an incorrect result, and replace it with another test device provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic of Tiokokko was wrong.
Prime Minister Matovič recommended that these test devices be thrown into the Danube River. Kara's aunt from the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test equipment purchased from Turkey from Turkey had "high levels of error" and they did not "use it".English Raya bought 3.5 million tests from Turkey, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of positive-tested people and tracking of people who contact positive-sARS-CoV-2, yields positive end results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, did two rounds of testing on the entire population of over 3,400 people, about 10 days away.
About half of the positive-tested people don't have symptoms, and all cases found in quarantine.
With restrictions on travel to this community, a new infection was eliminated at all.
With aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore develops much slower than other advanced countries, even without extreme restrictions, such as the closing of restaurants and ritual companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened on time after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with gangs with aggressive contacts, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower number of case fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive samples of COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the “positive test result” column is influenced by the country’s testing policy.
The country that only tests people in the hospital will have % higher positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors.
Washing hands, also known as hand-cleaning, is the act of cleaning the hands of someone who intends to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently on certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People may also experience respiratory disease, such as influenza or fever, if they do not wash their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, mucous membrane).
Five critical moments throughout the most important day to wash hands with soap is: before and after pouring out the water, after cleaning up the child's butt or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw garlic.
If there is no water and soap, hands can be cleaned with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning up children who have just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce disease spread.
The main purpose of hand-washing medicine is to clean hands from pathogens (confacts, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing harmful diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduced infant mortality at home.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that hand-washing practices can slightly increase the growth of the child’s balita.
In developing countries, infant mortality due to breathing and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage washing of hands can reduce diarrhea to about one third; this can be done by providing clean water in low - grade areas.
48% of cases of diarrhea can be linked with soap washing. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infection of acute breathing channels (ISPA), as a subconscious behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one child's death; this disease causes the death of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets can save more lives instead of vaccines or any medical action, and reduce death from diarrhea to nearly half and death from acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from impetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
The small side effect of washing hands is the frequent washing of hands that can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
Studies conducted in Denmark in 2012 found that handwashing can cause an itch and cystic skin condition, which is known as a hand or dermatitis, which mainly occurs among health workers.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCDs).
There are five critical moments all day when washing hands with soap is important in order to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (drinking, washing large water), after cleaning the baby's ass (change diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw garlic.
Another important time to apply washing techniques to prevent disease from occurring is before and after the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal shit or treating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practice washing hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97 percent; the United States almost in the middle of 77 percent; and Taiwan at the lowest level of 23 percent. Today some methodologies are available for changing behavior to improve the adoption of the practice of washing hands with soap at a critical time. Washing hands for students at the specified time is one of the options in developing countries to habitually wash hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Education Department in the Philippines is an example of proper scale action to support children’s health and education.
Two-fold-year-old worm drug delivery, plus washing your hands every day with soap and brushing your teeth every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
This program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleaning from the skin is strengthened by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main task of soap and detergent is to reduce barriers to traffic and increase latex power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because of fat and protein, which is an organic component of dirt, is not easily found in water.
However, adequate water is helping to cleanse the body and the protein.
Saturated soap, since its re-useable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from the previous use.
A small number of studies investigating the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that the transfer cannot occur because of the bacteria that are depleted with foam.
Even so, the CDC continues to say "the liquid soap that is out of the vessel without touching hands is more like it."
Antibacterial soap is widely promoted to a healthy society.
So far, there is no evidence that the antiseptic or disinfection that has been recommended better for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a public anti-cancer agent such as a trickle, which has an extensive list of foreign organisms.
So even though the antibiotic-resistant strain is not targeted by antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection substances, sophisticated formulations may contain acid (ascetic acid, ascorbate acid, lactate acid) as pH organizers, benzoate acid as active antimicrobials, and more skin conditioners (bean tongue, vitamins, laptops, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's Society of Health showed that ordinary soap is as effective as consumer anti-bacterial soaps that contain tricks in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hand.
Warm water that is comfortable to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than cold water is to remove natural oil that holds up dirt and bacteria.
However, with many people’s beliefs behind it, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in hand.
Hand service or hand antiseptic is a water-based cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, a hand-cleaning agent was a non-water-based drinker (also referred to as an alcohol-based hand-dresser, an antiseptic hand-dresser, or hand-servicing) becoming known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that is formulated along with the non-fatal substances such as Carbonmer (acrylic acid polymer) into gel or with moisture such as glycerin into liquid or foam to be easily used and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide encer increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand-drying that contains at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Alcohol therapy is used to kill bacteria, resistant bacteria against many drugs (MSSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol service containing 70% alcohol killed 99.97% (log 3.5 reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in hand 1 minute after use. The most effective hand service against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
An alcohol-based hand service almost not effective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics or sufficient alcohol growers should be used to thoroughly water or cover two hands.
The front and back of two hands and in the back and end of all fingers rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The tip of the finger must also be washed thoroughly by rubbing it in two palms. The Center for Control and Prevention of the U.S. Diseases recommends washing hands instead of hand-stamping, especially when the hand looks dirty.
Increase the use of the service agency because of the ease of use and rapid killing of microorganisms; however, the service agency should not be used as a replacement for the right hand wash, except soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand-drying can often cause dry skin, unless the emolynics and/or wetting are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emoticons to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based hand service containing hemolyne causes irritation and dry skin much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in the use of alcohol is rare.
The lower leads to dermatitis of contact that interferes with the attraction of this product is compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agent does not wipe hands from organic matter, but only disinfects it.
For this reason, handwashers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still in hand.
The honesty of the free hand service is highly dependent on its material and formulation, and according to history, this product significantly works worse than alcohol and alcohol abusers.
Recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have proven to have a continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, not like alcohol, which is proven to be reduced after repeated use, perhaps due to a progressive side-effect reaction.
Many in the low - grade community cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form alkali streams.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative soap when soap is not available.
The technique of washing the right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Center for preventing disease transmission includes the following steps:
Soak your hands with warm or cold water flowing.
Water is recommended because of the contaminating bascos, while water temperature seems to be unaffected.
Sprinkle your hands with a lot of soap, including your back, in your fingertips, and under your fingernails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Tomorrow at least 20 seconds.
Squeezing creates a disturbance, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer to remove more germs.
When exactly under the water flows.
Blasting in the bascom can cause the hands to be contaminated again.
Dry it with a dry lap or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and wet hands are easier to recontaminate.
The artificial nails and the missing nails can keep the microorganisms.
Losion softens often recommended to keep hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection.
Low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing of hands when running water and/or soap is not available, for example, flowing water from the syringe or bottle that hangs and holes and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when supplying restricted water (such as school or rural areas in developing countries), there is a water solution, such as "typy-tap", and other low-cost options.
Tippy tappy is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water that hangs on a rope, a tute that is operated by feet to pour a little water into hand, and a bunch of soap.
Effective handshake is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand-drugs in the public toilet.
The more research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than the electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Fabrice Symposium paper industry, to compare the level of paper cleaning, warm-air dryers, and more moderate jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase average 194% in fingerbooks and 254% in palms.
Disturbing with jet air dryers led to a total increase of 42% in the average number of bacteria in the finger books and 15% in the palm.
After washing and drying hands with a paper cover, the total number of bacteria decreases by an average of 76% in fingerbooks and 77% in the palm.Scientists also carry out tests to determine the potential of cross-contamination in other toilet users and the environment due to each type of drying method.
Jet air dryer, which sprays the air from a unit at a speed claimed 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and units and contaminating other toilet users and toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air dryers spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from dryers.
Paper slides do not show significant microorganism spread. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of hand-reduction were evaluated.
After drying hands, changes in the following number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand-dryers, and the dryer has been compared to the dryer using a paper cover.
Washing hands using hand-service tissue is alternative during travel if there is no soap and no water.
Alcohol-based hand service must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There is an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreased by using the device.
Medical washing was performed for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large number of or gels to kill and rub each part of the hand.
Hands have to be rubbed off each other with their fingers tied together.
If there's shit under the nails, the feathers can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water in hand, hands need to be cleaned thoroughly and dried with a clean lap.
After drying, a paper cover is used to shut down the water basin (and open the door if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The aim of washing hands in health care is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("cumen") and avoid their infection.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continually forget to wash their hands before touching patients so that they spread microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower the level of blood flow infection linked to the catheter up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published pages showing the standard of hand-washing and hand-playing in the health care sector.
The WHO hand-cleaning concept guidance can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant review by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand-cleaning if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has five moments to wash hands:
after it's exposed to blood/body discharge
before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (the "medicine" or "antimicrobial" soap) was used to kill handwashing.
The kill function may be desired before surgery or in situations where organisms that are resistant to antibiotics are very common. To 'scratch' hands before surgery, it is necessary to turn on and off without touching, chlorhexidine or iodium washing, sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub and other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All the jewelry has to be released.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
It's not a long time to rub (10 minutes).
When boiling, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After the washing of hands was completed, the hands were dried with sterile cloth and surgically worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand - service before and after treating the sick.
For the control of staphylococcus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand-cleaning was from the first 20% washing, and that the additional benefit obtained was very little when the frequency of hand-cleaning was increased above 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the spread of infection to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between washing hands with alcohol-based bacteria and washing hands with antibacterial soap at an average time of 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based hand scrubbers reduce the contamination of the bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashers to reduce the A H1N1 influenza virus and difficult clostridium spores from the hands. Interventions to improve health care hygiene may involve education for staff on hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based handwashers, and written and lisative reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective intervention in various health care arrangements.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand - washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand - washing machines near a private toilet or a public toilet are rarely available, even though options are available to make a cheap washroom.
In any case, the low level of handwashing can also occur because of habits that have been implanted and not because of lack of soap or water.
Push and encouragement to wash hands with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and produce changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
For effective walking, monitoring and evaluation is required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to improving handwashing in LMIC, while a less effective social marketing campaign. One example of school-based handwashing is "Thirty Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash hands with soap, among other requirements of cleanliness.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a washroom can be part of a hand-washing campaign to reduce the disease and death of children.
World Hands Washing Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign that tries to achieve the goal of changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand-washing emoji.
Some studies investigate the effectiveness of the overall cost of washing hands in countries developed in connection with the avoidance of disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost to illness.
One survey shows that it is significantly more expensive to wash hands with soap instead of water and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for vulnerable people, such as a newborn mother or wounded soldier in the hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two hands-cleaning agents: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "consisting modern care" in England.
At that time, many people still believed that infection was caused by the foul smell of miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, a plague that was transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases more active stimulates hand-cleaning as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased awareness in many countries will be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from the contagious disease.
For example, the poster "the right hand-washing technique" is hung on the sinks of the hands-washing system in the public toilet and in the bathroom of the office and airport in Germany.
The expression "washing hands from" means declaring someone's objection to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
It comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands with the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has been a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash his hands constantly to cleanse the imaginary knot; an act that showed his guilt for the crime he had committed and had persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, by remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more frequently and tend to appreciate more hand-washing equipment.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after that meditation have a smaller poverty involved in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
The religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanliness and symbolism. The washing of hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is the ritual part of washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í belief, Hindu, had and neutralized yedayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam. The religion also orders the washing of hands for cleanliness, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Furthermore, Hindus, Buddhas, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam had to wash their hands before and after meals.
Hazardous control of the workplace for COVID-19
The safety and health management of the workplace for COVID-19 is the use of safety and occupational health methodologies for risk control for the prevention of the 2019 koronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The proper risk management at the workplace depends on the job location and work, which is based on the risk assessment of the sources of treatment, the level of disease in society, and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal contact with the public and other workmates; for this work, steps to prevent basic infection, which includes washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and cleaning and disinfecting the working environment routinely.
Occupations at risk are involving jobs that require close or often contact with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by the spread of current or international travel in society.
This group includes workers who have contacts with public society such as at school, working environment with high population density, and high volume ritual setting.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency airway, safety shield against sine, and providing self-protection tools when encountering the COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers that the health and morgue of people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 are at risk of high exposure, which increases the risk of high exposure if workers perform an aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, those who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for these workers includes technical control, such as negative pressure ventilation room, and self - protection tools that fit the work assignment.
The COVID-19 plague can have some effects at work.
Workers may not come to work because they are sick, need to care for others, or they may fear that treatment will be possible.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to obtain these items (such as shopping out of busy hours, by delivery, or survey).
Finally, shipments of goods from the highly affected geographic area of the COVID-19 can be disrupted. The treatment and treatment plan for infection can be used to guide protection.
The plan considers the risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, including supply sources, risk factors arising from household and community arrangements, and the risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical condition.
The article also outlines the control needed to deal with the risk and the emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the plague.
The association and plan for the removal of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the cancellation of the plague includes reducing the spread of staff, protecting those at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The level of disease resistance in the community where business is affecting the act of annulment taken.
The danger control hierarchy is a labor framework that is widely used in safety and health at work to group risk control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last protective tool.
Technical control covers isolation of employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be the most expensive solution to be applied.
Administrative control is a change in the policies or procedures of work that require the action of workers or employers.
Self - protection (ODA) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help to prevent part of the operation.
All types of ODA should be selected on the basis of risks to workers, correctly installed as (e.g., respiratory), consistently and correctly supplied, checked, treated, and replaced on a time basis, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and stored correctly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), low - risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and other workmates.
Steps to prevent basic infection recommended for all workplaces include often washing hands accurately, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, breathing ethics includes covering cough and sine, providing network and trash, preparing work from a distance or shift of work at a time of arrival/return, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and doing routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation against potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. recommended that employees with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reduction or other symptoms, and for flexible leave policies to allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and for employees to know this policy.
According to OSHA, work at risk is involving work that requires close or often contact within six feet (1,8 meters) with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the spread in the community around the business location, or because someone new international travels to the location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes employees who have contact with public society such as at school, working environment with high population density, and high volume maintenance settings. Technical control for this group and high risk group includes installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as hairguard tools, and installing non-essential drive windows or customer service facilities. Administrative control for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meeting with virtual communication, making working rounds with time arrival/return steps, stopping non-essential travel to locations experiencing COVID-19 disease, developing emergency communication plans including safety protections to respond to workers' needs, equipping employees with education and training on the risk factors COVID-19, and possibly hand-to-use, and/or, training employees who are in needing to use their clothing and work tools to provide support for their use.
The workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect the workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from the other person by 6 feet, pointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering masks for the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
You cabins should wear medical gloves once used when caring for sick passengers or touching contaminated body fluid or surface and perhaps other protective devices if sick passengers suffer fever, continual coughing, or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and the other items used must be disposed of in the bags of life, and the contaminated surface must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.
Ideally, further medical action is done in the cabin of people who are isolated. Apart from the public distribution, for school and child placement facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if the infected person is ever in the school building.
If there is a population transmission at the minimum level up to now, the social limitation strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, voice-cooling classes, or eating in cafes, increasing the distance between tables, time arrival and gradual return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using the location of a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high incidence in local society, in addition to a social limitation strategy, extending the closure of the school can be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, the risk of immediate health risks is considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or expected COVID-19 recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect the belt and task equipment before being used again by using sprays or household cleaners and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of old ODAs and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue are at high or very high risk.
High risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation services that are identified with known or expected COVID-19 patients.
This work is a very high risk if workers perform aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle the specimens of, known patients or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, coughing induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen removals.
The morgue room work is at risk of high exposure involving workers involved in preparing the body of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at death; this work is at risk of very high treatment if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technical control for this risk group includes an isolation room for known or expected COVID-19 patients, including when the aerosol production procedure is performed.
Ventilation of special negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care arrangements and morgue.
Specimen must be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come be separated into a different waiting room based on whether they are expected to be COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of known patients or are suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol production procedure.
In the United States, N95 filter caps approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive breathing protection programs that include tests of fitness, training, and medical examination.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and improve the safety of the worker. WHO does not recommend all-out or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluid.
WHO only recommended the surgical mask for the screening officer at the entry point.
For those who take the specimen of breathing, caring, or transporting patients COVID-19 without an aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves.
If an aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that ODA supply is not sufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing ODA needs through long distance medical services, physical limitations such as window-outs, with only those involved in direct care can enter the room containing patients COVID-19, using only the necessary ODA for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respiratory system without releasing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and ordering the chain of ODA supply, and not pushing the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUBJEK BARIS: [Covid-19] Relaxing the burden and preparing for the future
LANGUAGES: March 14, 2020, 00:00 UTC
License: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear the global human relationship and the responsibility we have to each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and building a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've witnessed among all our coworkers through email, calls, and talks are an extraordinary validation of extraordinary human beings, which we're lucky enough to work with them.
My gratitude and pride are inexhaustible so that I can call you a workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means to the world today to access Wikipedia and how it is a powerful symbol of this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, either you make sure this site keeps running, help pay our partners, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization going all the time.
We really want to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set holidays, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted at this time, and either you need to care for loved ones, shop for needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been said, but we did.
Sick leave or PTO is not necessary, just let your manager know and help your team revise your calendar and schedule to make sure the main work areas can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed with positive COVID-19, please tell Bryan in the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Companions whose hour-based wages will be paid full.
We have said it, and say it again, to respect our commitment to the contractor's partners and the clock-based staff.
All people will be paid according to their normal working hours.
It includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way to alleviate stress to the world around us.
Our work can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and Dana Discovery Team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to assess the current purpose and divert our focus to support the essentials for our mission.
There is much to do for all of us, only a full focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down right now will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "working late in pursuit" after this pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work late to meet the current unrealistic deadline.
We realized that the situation was changing and would try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to new realities and daytime expectations, we intended to adjust the time line for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make the budget so that employees can prioritize important work, care, and care for the loved ones while providing them with the necessary accommodations or wanting to work with fewer schedules for the next few weeks.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressures throughout the organization.
We'll send our proposals to the next week's board and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, repair, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based partners may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Being extremely worried, however, we hired an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco’s office.
They're using the hospital-based antiviral fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building implements its own safety conservation protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenant.
We're happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office had moved to a long-distance work order, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our fellow NYC-based colleagues told us, we were also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a distance for the first time.
Our long - working colleagues realize that it may require adjustments and they want to give you advice:
The longest meeting rate is one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into days.
Define meetings clearly, create agendas, and send out previous publications.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a record of the meeting (or make a collaborative record).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the job shared
The SDM Operation Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidance to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all funders to extend the community to cancel the public event funded by Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic is over.
We tell them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions can make them impossible to complete the approved major activity and that no one will be given an appointment because they have to postpone or modify the target.
This coming week we will continue with the additional guide on Wikimania and the regional and other thematic community conferences.
Generally speaking, feelings from the entire global community seem to be a sadness over these disturbances, but at the same time they are relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT is trying to prepare a page at Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can keep getting information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 at Office Wiki.
CRT will keep updating this page and making sure all the information is in one place.
We're also trying to keep regular communication with staff living in countries that are now significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, the main course of work, or difficulties about the environment, or other things that may require help, do not hesitate to tell and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be the right link.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of Global Operations International SDM.
None of these changes are seen as the burden of our work and our obligation.
On the contrary, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and duty may need to be adapted in a way we have never done before.
These are the steps we are confident of the importance of supporting each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support of our movements, and provide the world of services that they rely on.
The work we planned earlier will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for important work to come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as you need.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of Team Leader (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzim angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activities that are opposite to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Agiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 reverse enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing a ring located on the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein has the domain M2 peptide terminal-N and the domain transporter amino renal acid collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I bypass membrane protein, with an enzyme-active domain located on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extrasel domain is separated from the domain transmegran by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the most proteased protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the membrane of cells especially type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, artery endothel cells and veins, and pulmonary muscle cells in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function ACE2 is as an ACE monitor.
ACE splits angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts amino phenylalanine carbonoxyl terminal acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and dehydrolysis becomes angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, amarin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges for traffic in transporting amino acid neutral SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as a major entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (sars-cause virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (shars-cause virus COVID-19).
More specifically, binding S1 protein on spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 thinners with ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of the cell results in endostatosis and transfer of viruses and enzymes into the endosomals located in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the first of S proteins by the TMPRSS2 protein protease series, which is currently being studied as potential therapy. This fact causes people to hypothesize that lowering the ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitor therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors causes a reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also linked to the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 human recommendation (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by liposaccharide.
The rhACE2 half-time in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute workout besides a 24-hour effect.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for patients with intolerance against classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS) or disease with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'Application COVID-19 is a software software designed to help trace contacts to overcome the 2019-2020 choronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people who may have made contact with the infected.
Many applications were developed or proposed, which received official support from the government in some regions and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
The privacy problem is questioned, especially related to the system based on the geographic location of the application user.
Alternatives that don't oversupply privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity with other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In Thailand, the Government of Thailand, together with Alipay, has deployed applications that allow citizens to check whether they have contacted the COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in more than 200 cities in Tinokhkok. In Singapore, it uses an application called TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launches "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track how people who are potentially infected and respond quickly to the health care authority.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the application is still waiting for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store agreement.
On 12 April, the government stated that a contact tracking application is in progress and will be available for distribution within weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singaporea and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security technology at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on the application-based system, which includes false positives and the possibility of lack of effectiveness if the data is taken by a limited number of populations.
To overcome concerns about the spread of a misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" application, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add the coronavirus related application to the App Store, that is to limit only for a "remi" organization or that has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Privacy supporters express their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to handle the choronavirus pandemic will be stopped after a threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
This organization states eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance shall be "according to law, necessary, and proportional";
surveillance and surveillance needs to have the sun's plummet;
the use of data must be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
security and data anonymity must be protected and proved protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid more severe discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with the third party must be defined in the law;
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all of my "relevant interests" required, including community health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan is intended to address the monitoring problem by removing tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, not applications, so eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
A network-based solution that has access to raw location data has significant privacy potential.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protected systems have been created and use the central server only for intercom (see below).
In South Korea, a non-based system used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce notifications through text messages to people who may be infected.
Besides using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is allowed with extensive changes in privacy laws information after fire at MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using the central system and the system that protects privacy.
Until 6 April 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is a well-planned concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralised approach, rather than a single protocol. The decentralised protocol includes the tracking of Decentralised Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called Contact Genesis Number, CEN), Protocols and Sensitive Mechanisms Privacy for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection techniques when collecting and using the location or intersect data flow to track COVID-19.
This is based on a study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Other similar works are SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was originally also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, global NCT coalitions were established by groups that had basically the same approach and were a highly flexible protocol, with a view to reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which was a major aspect of reaching broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for tracking contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and cryptographies that protect privacy.
They also release the specification of core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
launch tools to allow the government to create official application for tracking kronovirus that protects privacy
This function integration directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to solve data collection and surveillance problems continues at first distributing the system through the updating of the operating system, and then deleting it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition drugs (also known as a new purpose, new profile, or new task on medication or therapy transfer) are the approved use of drugs for the purpose of new treatment, namely for disease or medical conditions that are different from the initial purpose of drug development.
This path is a scientific research path that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Another study direction includes the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transfusion convalesen. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding sites.
Analysis of these linkage sites can be the basis for effective anti-virus development project against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A A, et al researched a number of newly optimized candidate compounds and analyzed the cross-sectional similarity with approved drugs and had the highest migraine to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential drugs in its clinical study to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorokuins and related hydrochlorokuins were two of the four drugs to be examined as part of the clinical trials of Solidarity.
Governor New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that a chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin test in New York will begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokuin sulphate and chlorokuin phosphate based on Authorization of Emergency Use (USA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial and U.S.-based authorisation only as an experimental treatment for the use of emergencies in patients receiving incapacitated treatment, but cannot accept treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or hydroxychlorokuin duration for prophylaxis or SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been set.
The doctor said they used that medicine when there was no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chlorokine combined with rice, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety test and an honest use of hydroxychlorokuin prevention.
The Chinese clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "exactly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the medication.
In a study carried out in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipyravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Board reminded the public that there is no evidence to support the cure and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for supplies and use the military to send drugs to a university hospital, where drugs would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to Trump's government on the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in cases of a serious disease with multiple viruses.
This medicine may not be safe if used by a pregnant mother or someone trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits are observed".
This medicine is designed to prevent HIV reproduction by binding protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will connect with SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are criticisms in scientific society about the provision of resources to respond to specially developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Then Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activities against certain wires, pneumo-, paramigo-, and corronovirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early trials show that remdesivir may have a high genetic resistance, and there are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials performed by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with a disease and one for a severe disease.
There are three clinical trials being conducted for intravenous vitamin C for those who are ill and ill with COVID-19 severely, namely two controlled plasebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for azithromisin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The National Health and Global Medicine Center (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, corticosteroids inhalation for asthma, for new presymptomatic coronovirus infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 reverse enzyme, Phase II testing is going on with 200 patients will be recruited from a severe case that is being treated temporarily in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out how effective treatment is.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently examining the role of coking in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require inhalation.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or do not use effective contraception methods do not meet the requirements.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low - molecular heparin is often used to treat patients so that it encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on their use.
A multicentered study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at a dose of prophylaxis and therapeutics was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on providing a new treatment purpose for approved antiviral drugs and developed for earlier outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the seventh edition of the Chinese language guide
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the seventh edition of the Chinese guide
Some antibiotics identified as potential drugs that can be given a new purpose for COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (Anti-Receiver IL-6): Approved by Tiokkok.
In addition, try to do the tests in Italy and in Tiokkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against the 2019 koronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trial, there is a lot of effort being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this disease's kaussative virus, would not be available within less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 identified in December 2019.
The major plague spread throughout the world in 2020, which led to major investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome that is published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative stated in April that the thing to be observed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution on the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target advanced to Phase I security studies, includes:
Nuclear acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I controller and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector viruses (phase I control and vaccine candidacy: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered as being in planning or planning).
Test phase I-II perform early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, controlled by placebo, and at some locations, determining a more appropriate effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, monitoring the side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (even in "praclinis" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular tightening vaccines that would genetically modify the protein virus to stimulate immune reactions.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported particle development similar to coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protected by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to develop a mRNA-based vaccine together.
Currently, vaccine candidates based mRNA, BNT162 are in clinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Tiks Biotech announced that they would get the results of a clinical trial in April 2020 and a vaccine candidate at the final stage could begin to be tested on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, Koalisy Innovation Epidemic Asia (CEPI) announced a total investment of US$4.9 million in the consortium of Vaccine Research COVID-19 involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with total investment of CEPI in the development of Vaccine COVID-19 reaching US$29 million.
Another CEPI investment partner for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russia's health officer announced that scientists had started six vaccine candidates testing on animals.
Imperial College London's researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccines that could achieve their own COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from Turkey.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced a total of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at the Canadian company and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C$192 million funding to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to build a national "Vaccinated Bank" containing some new vaccines that can be used if another coronary heart disease occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported a PittCoVacc test, COVID-19 vaccine candidate, on mice; they stated that "MNA that gave S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine produces a specific antibodies response that could be considered 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Faculty of Waterloo University Pharmacy announced the design of DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophagus, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce such harmless particles that can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit beyond the disease that prevents them.
Try further tests in Australia to follow 4,170 health officers.
There's a possibility of vaccine development is not going to be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine honesty using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, shows the need for steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in coping with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on nonhuman animal models.
By 2020, no protective drugs or vaccines for SARS proved safe and effective for humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, an established SARS study can be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatment for MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine completed phase I clinical tests on humans, and three other vaccines were in process, all of which were virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media support the conspiracy theory that claims viruses behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccine is available.
The patents quoted by various social media refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus gala, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from the date of appearance to the symptoms in general about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and failure of the major organs.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. This virus mainly spreads interhumanism when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Although it is produced when breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and by touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last for 72 hours.
This virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of real-time transcription polymerase chains (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharynx.
The use of masks is encouraged for people who are suspected of being infected with viruses and taking care of them.
Recommendation on the use of masks by different public authorities; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend its use, and others require its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO territories.
People infected with the virus can have no symptoms or symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breath.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, pain or swelling in the chest, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips; medical rejection is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
The upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, swallowing, or sore throat, can be found, but more rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in various percentages.
Some cases in the beginning of the year were based only on clinical portrayals of the chest and palpitation.
In some, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the mucus, and death.
This time is called a time of incubation.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those with an infection will experience symptoms in 11.5 days, reports show that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of this untimely carrier in the transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms that are unknown and under investigation, with the Korean Center for Control and Prevention of Disease (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain unchanged during hospital treatment.
The National Health Commission of Thailand began to report undisclosed cases in its daily case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and liquid water can carry virus loads on a large scale.
Talking loudly releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bio-aerosol transmission may occur and air-constraints placed outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can cause the breathing secretion to turn into an aerosol and spread through the air.
While there is concern that the virus can spread through physiques, this risk is believed to be low.
The Center for Prevention and Control of European Disease (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two or three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, found that viruses can be detected for one day on cards/cards, up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and rust-resistant steel (AIS 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products describe the fat layer of virus protectors, deactivate viruses, and release them from skin and other surfaces.
Other levels, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgery disinfection), are less effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day test.
Coronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is new acute breathing syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the acute breathing disease class in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features on the coronavirus that is related to nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by home soap, which ruined its protective bubbles.
The lung is the most affected organ by the COVID-19 because the virus accesses the angel cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) modifying enzyme, the most abundant in the type II lung alveolar cell.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice or thinning" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter an angel cell.
Acute heart injury was found in 12% of infected people who were treated poorly in Wuhan, Thailand, and more often in severe disease.
High level of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute miokard injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptor is expressed very highly in the heart and involved in the heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and viral thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU and may be related to a bad prognosis. Autopsy in those who died because of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and infiltration of lymphocyte-containing inflammation in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for breathing epithel cells that express ACE2, patients with heavy COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, T cells that secrete GM-CSF pathogens have proven to correlate with monosites that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphostic infiltration has also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction transcription real-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on a breathing sample obtained through a nasopharynx; however, a nasal or sputum sample can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires two samples taken at two weeks’ length so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this choronavirus gallus and release its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop the testing of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) independently to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, the antibody test (which can detect active infection and if someone has been infected before) is in development, but not widely used.
The experience of the test in the city of Cyprus showed that it was only 60 to 70 percent accurate.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongan Hospital University Wuhan suggest methods to detect infection based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Ground-glass bilateral multilobar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetric, and posterior much found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy Paving (septum compensation lobular with varying alveolar filling), and consolidation can occur as disease develops.
A little data is available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathological finding on autopsy is:
Macroscopy: pleurisity, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of immune pneumonia can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumosis hyperplasia, large-typic pneumosis, interstitial inflammation with lymphostic infiltration, and the formation of giant cells with a lot of intent
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar ecstasy.
DAD is a cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: the extractive ingredients in the alveolar gland and interstitial fibrosis of the lung
Blood: intravascular coagulation is increased (DIC); leukoryroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending the use of the inner elbow if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene hands appropriate after coughing or sneezing are encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of the cover of cloth in public places, partly to limit the transmission by people without symptoms. The social restriction strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public.
Limitations also include keeping at least six feet or eight feet [1.8 m] away.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19.Because vaccines are not anticipated until the beginning of 2021, the main part of treating COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "coupling curve".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating, and after spraying their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
Further, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand-enhancing that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-enhancing is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active for hand antiseptics".
Glyserol is added as moisture.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they carry the virus in order to wear a simple face mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure issues, but the benefit is still considered.
Cleanness and lifestyle and healthy eating patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for those with mild symptoms at the early stage of the infection. WHO and the National Health Commission in Turkey have issued recommendations to deal with inhaled COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care professionals and lung experts in the U.S. have established recommendations for care from various agencies as a free source of resources, IBCC.
Until April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical forces more recommend parasetamol (astaminofen) than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the risk of virus infection, especially in health care arrangements when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health care for the COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Isolation Area of Airborne Infections (IAIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact prevention actions, and poultry prevention actions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of the protective device (APD) during the pandemic.
The recommended tools are: APD clothing, respirators or facial masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. If available, respirators are not better.
The N95 Respirator is approved for industrial orders, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on the US Emergency Use Authorisation.
N95 respirators are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use in the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protector or, as a last effort, a fabric mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some are heavy.
The type of breathing support for people who have failed to breathe COVID-19 is currently being studied for those who are incapacitated, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided by high-flowing nasal canal or bipositive air pressure.
Not known whether one of these two methods yields the same benefit to those who are critically ill.
Some doctors prefer to still use invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared with the high-level nasal canal.
Many advanced countries do not have adequate hospital beds per captain, which restricts the capacity of the health system to deal with sudden surges in the number of cases of COVID-19 which are sufficiently severe so that it requires inhalation.
A study in Thailand found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Thailand, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were treated did not end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated with acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) occurring on COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothoracs.
High PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
Research on treatment potential begins in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are under clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some drugs that are being tested have been approved for other uses or have been in further testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe disease.
Volunteers who recommend WHO also participate in tests of potential efficacy and safety. FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalesen plasma as experimental treatment in cases of very or very threatened life.
Plasma convalesen has not yet undergone a clinical study needed to prove its safety and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Thailand launched mobile applications to deal with this disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'near contact' using surveillance data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, the application not only recommends self-recommendated quarantine, but also tells local health officers. Analyzes data on mobile data, facial recognition technology, phone tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track infected people and people who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
By March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security body to track the phone numbers of those suspected to be coronaryly infected.
It was taken to treat quarantine and protect people who might be contacted by infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in a range of researching and preventing the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told that "40% of citizens still move places".
The German government did a 48 hour weekend hack at over 42,000 people.
Furthermore, President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for a creative solution against the choronavirus circulation.
People may experience stress because of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of care, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Raising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic degradation is a perfect storm that endangers mental health and the well-being of society."
This disease can be mildly or unexplained, which resembles another public’s respiratory disease, such as a tick.
Mild cases usually heal in two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less. In some people, COVID-19 can influence lung so as to cause pneumonia.
In the worst affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of the mosquito system.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood flow, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clotting disorders, especially increases in prothrombin time, are observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients who are incubated, while kidney function disorders are seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 images show an increase in heart enzyme (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in incubation.
However, the patient who was transferred to the ICU has an average of seven days between inept and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiokkok, a man has 2.8% death, while a woman has 1.7% death.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples shows alveolar damage diffused with cell fibromyxoid ecstasy in both lungs.
Changes in cytopathic viruses observed on pneumosis.
A lung image resembles acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission in Turkey, heart damage is observed, with an increase in troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people who are under treatment have their normal condition, and the availability of medical and social resources in an area can also affect mortality.
The estimated mortality rate varies due to differences in the area, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Fewer case calculations can cause the number of deaths to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean the current mortality rate is too low.
Smoking has a possibility of 1.4 times more severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or to die than non-smokers. There is concern over the duration of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some individuals recovering from disease, and lung scans indicate organ damage.
It can also cause parasitic-intensive syndrome after healing.
By March 2020, it is not known whether the previous infection would provide effective and long-term immunity to people who are cured of this disease.
Immunities may be obtained, if you look at other coronavirus behaviors, but have been reported a case of COVID-19 healing followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a major leftover infection, not a re-infection.
These viruses are thought to be natural and come from animals, through widespread infections.
The fact is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of first COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of WHO reported the latest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary according to region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed laboratory and U07.2 for death due to COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Death ratio against cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall death rate against cases is 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) by April 17, 2020.
The number varies according to the region. Other measures cover the number of fatalities (CFRs), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed who died of certain diseases, and the number of fatalities of infection (IFRs), which reflect the percentage of people infected (diagnosis and undiagnosed) who died of certain diseases.
This statistic is not time-bound and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people create antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
In the outbreak of an earthquake in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) is already dead.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively low mortality, and probably not all of the COVID-19 deaths classified as COVID-19 death.
Moreover, the German health system had not yet come under control.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as examined by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in Turkey and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, at a risk difference between new men and women didn't appear at the age of 90.
In Thailand, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for this type of gender is certainly unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking on women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality on men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are men and 72% are men who died because of COVID-19 is men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track data related to gender for COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that viruses, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers with a higher gender gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of getting a virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the abbreviation for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time identified plague: December 31, 2019.
It is chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g., Tiokhkok), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for storage intended to prevent stigmatization. Virus that caused COVID-19 to be named koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both disease and the daily virus are called koronavirus.
At the beginning of the epidemic in Wuhan, Thailand, the virus and this disease are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute breathing disease as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidelines that lead to not using the location name in the name of the disease and the virus.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal valves and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital greatly needs ventilator valves, and the supplier cannot give in the necessary time scale, a local company runs around and prints 100 valves needed in the last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and disinformation emerges about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no drug or vaccine approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academics, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization practiced "Solidarity Trial" to examine the effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds of honesty.
The vaccine is not available yet, but various institutions are active in developing vaccine candidates.
Previous study of SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were also using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers aim to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, is intended to quickly trigger the immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
Second strategy, subunited vaccine, intended to create vaccines that make immune systems sensitive to certain subunits on viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps viruses absorb ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique to create vaccines).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies must be tested for safety and safety. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-hazardous genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. Dependent-antibodies increase has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials that are taking place in April 2020.
Seven tests try to evaluate the approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychlorokuin or chlorokuin.
The newly targeted antiviral drugs make up most of the research in Thailand, with nine Phase III tests on redesivirs in some countries with reporting deadlines at the end of April.
By April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs has already existed.Some of the antiviral drugs currently being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, which include remdesivir, chlorokin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are being combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the remdesivir honesty.
Clinical enhancement is observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trial is being conducted in the US, Tiokhkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in Tiokh in February 2020, with early results.
However, there is a call for an international review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Institute of Virology Wuhan, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an authorization for emergency use for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policy of a doctor who cared for COVID-19 patients.The seventh edition of the Chinese Domendant also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data shows that the high dose of ribavirin is required to slow SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksakinide has been recommended for further in vivo study after showing sar-coV-2 restraint in low concentration.Research shows that early principing against protein thinning by serin protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is very important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin with or without azithromycin have large limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not limit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
The complications of the sitokin storm can occur on the COVID-19 weight of further steps.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have an antisitokin nature. Tocilizumab has been put in the medical guidelines by the National Health Commission in Turkey after a small study is completed.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 random tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with serum feritin blood tests to identify sitokin storms, these drugs are intended to combat sitokin storms, which are suspected to be the cause of death to some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-induced sitokin refractor-receptor syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there's no random and controlled evidence that shows that tocilizumab is an effective medicine for CRS.
Transferring the refined and bonded antibodies produced by the human system that has been cured from COVID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a method of passive non-vaccination immunization.
This strategy is tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Neutralization of viruses is a working mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy that can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cell sitetoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may as well.
Other passive antibodies therapy forms, for example, using the produced monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalesen serum, which is part of the fluid of patients' blood that has been cured and contains specific antibodies against this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliland, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died because of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the virus.
