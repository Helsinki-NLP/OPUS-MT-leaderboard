UKIP residents who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specific arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to make the queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're using specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing suckers, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
No one would then be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just made it comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's sentence was very surprised, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to succeed in getting back to you.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is spoken of so rarely because unlike Farage and his mad followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis in the period of austerity, nothing will have been done.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's 'TIGRE DE L'EUROPE' was bragging about us a few years ago.
We've had the next one!
This begins to read the article again.
It is attempted to make Ireland a virtuous country and a '' NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE''' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a flexible labour market, and a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not what to '' peddle'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long calm river, it is on sight of recent events.
The lowest rate of taxes in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France by policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to be issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become enormous, and there are new (and expensive) cars all around the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, which has been evident in the daily cloisters since the return.
Is it supposed to be economical?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be on fire.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I'm stealing with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once they're rascaled.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair have to pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give themselves joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic rate only have to take them themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport air controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they were not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your indemnity dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally grouille of the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, most) or for the Salon de la magazine à l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, a world pass with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is affected by the fact that they buy for a fee.
Tourism areas lose considerable turnover each year for the same reasons .
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows for lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right which, except for exceptions, workers benefit.
This is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy, nor the Minister responsible for foreign affairs, has the least competence to reform the labour code.
While they're closing it.
What's the law for?
To satisfy some of the people and businesses who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay her inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Surely his estate would like his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He kept in mind the other government aristos who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell paintings on the free market to raise the money for inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure yards being by definition unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true French bad: the mistrust of dialogue
Return to chief values.
Reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest among us not be in need!
Either we are in solidarity with him, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he has rendered or has provided to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the tenant who lives income from his property.
There is a need to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
A property to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is particularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage decline so brutal
You might have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is screaming: isolation, renewal of the rail network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc.
Taxation that promotes high income and income.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all those phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
Besides, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people attach no value to the design, for them options, functionality and price first.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what we're all interested in.
I am glad that you found exactly what you were looking for and that it is not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas rather than men (on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they are fighting ideas about the genre and tell us the works they really want to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vineyard, recalling Holopherne, a rapprochement that hadn't come to me (I don't have his vibrancy of mind).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you send it back, this subject doesn't interest me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@Jean: recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid of asking about the world?
But what are we afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us response elements.
The first by invoking Judith from the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic slitter of throat.
We can see how close these studies are to them.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To pretend to fight ideas from the only exhibition that their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not on the other hand that he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic slitter of gorge, I was content with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon suddenly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really put the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
It bothers you, doesn't it?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the rain of meteors of the Persées and for almost all of the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observatory, even though things get much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
Anyone who looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends (force) by disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Superb picture of the moon above the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to hit the Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on the inequalities between labour income and capital.
Nothing on tax fraud.
The ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these claims are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Let's see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece, the stock exchange collapsed.
Yet it seems to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a demand for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economics states that these claims are not substantiated.
What if the Ministry of Economics is wrong?
Will the decision-makers who have made the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The follow-up in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporary horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is depleted by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, they contribute to the financing of tangible and intangible investments in future growth and therefore future revenue.
A few elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not correspond to your ghost.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands tied by the law as written by the policies.
It's the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health system to look like the United States, you should know how it works.
Physicians worldwide are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and "research".
Please read the few reports on our pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs everywhere, as well as the differences between countries on what is on sale free or only on orders.
This reinforces itself is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that brake them and the expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who come to a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on in the backstage for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the finger in the ear of someone in charge of that hospital.
We can't keep patents on the grass...
If social science researchers did research instead of policy and networking, they could use their "work".
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is doing no research pedagogy.
We can't say "research is done it must be applied" and then in the same jet "we have to experiment with everything."
If your research is done, why experiment?
If your research has not been completed why do you ask for them to be applied?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn how to use new technologies, but how would they manage to learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory.
What's the use of building an indicator that informs you of what's going on, self-promotion, deception?
One track to train teachers: distance sophisticians and ideologists from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
factory connect the paragraph on internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion encourages us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of the practices in force, and does not allow the system to progress."
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fierce: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who only has a theoretical training, I'd rather have a surgeon who doesn't have any theoretical training and who has learned about it.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP responsible for combating copyright violations by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If I ever begin to feel guilty about violating copyright, I will just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright violation = theft.
It's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same.
By using content without proper license, you deprive artists of their breadwinner.
You can always argue with pessimistic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a copyright violation.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I'm starting to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, you don't mind depriving artists of their incomes.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictional income.
Lesson No. 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave all intellectual property on the site under the general conditions that they have passed from one click.
Maybe if they share their mp3 walkers with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource we're so glad about, the ralleur who says everything's wrong....
If it's a PS MP who claims it, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they're of choice, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France pulls people down by assistants continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What brings France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm employed because I know I don't have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null bosses I often meet.
At ease in my basketballs I fully share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if compared with German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What do French employers expect to do so??
The state holding their hand?
This state that they accuse of impertinence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-company couple on your side!
Remember me, that you created as a job, as added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are bountiful and miner while awaiting permanent state assistance!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removing the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare claim the decrease in wages or their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people still complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay floating instead of changing.
It doesn't mean that Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do so, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But, well, the Labour's gonna get us bored, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and from taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of this so that the decision was finally canceled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they have told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all work across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be pleased with this decision;)
This may be because the Dutch management is on good tracks while the British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change in ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening to it, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaters", who are no less dead, I know of it.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's go again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you this helps..
Nothing to do with anything worth...!
When the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'll be right back.
Insinuating, would it be only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite will, despite confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I am sorry to think otherwise, if, having a strong morale will probably make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine..
But if we prefer to return to the "Lord" it's something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to the moralists.
When you catch a piece of shit, a real one, you get stripped of yourself to the point of becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I beat myself up like these psychological ends say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of tightening your teeth, suffering from hell and beating your fists.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and completed about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten anniversary.
His trial was conducted "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told back then?
The Communist became a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE MOINDRE rule of international law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO's attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western States that then lied ultimately to the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office because he did not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as Tyran (even if we do not love him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of predicting earthquakes is walking about, measuring the pedestrian level in the quartz.
These types of studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for having us share the results.
A hope, therefore, but caution is placed This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located at about 124 light years from the Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine, University of Maryland.
The method to be followed.
Just like those involving animals who feel a threat come.
Thank you Science Passer for giving us, often, these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (In advance )?
No doubt through the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A priori odourless gas for man but may be detachable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have reliable results on these tracks...
It has often been observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and especially to their modification before an earthquake.
Well, I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we face the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand how we can think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and always tries to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't make a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected as mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just points out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not so) he takes the lead of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will collapse the ceiling I am sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what Londoners were saying.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than he
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the worth of reading a few books (there are some books, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "strike Strait" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We actually went to the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission reaches its end.
It's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozen consumption to achieve the goal totally discredited the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors that philanthrops.
An additional como operation is neither done nor done.
The cow is too eager!!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your story makes me look back, identifying myself a little in the passage (I also learned how to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn au Moulin Blanc in rade de Brest!).
Also hat for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to turn us over, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Bretagne Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as sympathetic as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
He's Bisevac, the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the large Velez team who, under the supervision of the legendary Suleman Rebach, finished twice in the second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had such scores as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as much as I know there was no owner.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not what is called the Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country tips to the neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt "an explosion of joy" by watching two laps collapse knowing that women, men and unsuspecting children are inside?
How?
What bothers me a little in this "witness", is that the only fact that I could, it would be only once, to rejoice spontaneously of the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to a "border line" personality whose all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
No doubt at the short time of "joy", we would have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It has just been thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had been able to do real and apocalyptic harm to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who are plagued by their feelings of humiliation.
With filmed testimonies in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfraud.
We were wondering a little bit.
The West "Christian/white/gaulish" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this devilish nightmare?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigated the Arab world: the bigotism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freeze of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, we must not turn the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath in autumn.
Not as much to cut the breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grunts that rumble clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of excruciating odors, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowing and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the monitoring of child supplements , it is the amount paid by the State that comes mainly from Dec. 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , mainly deciles 4 and 5 are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of half of the share for widows in particular is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is fully assessed: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and assumes it is painless.
And he's not ready to make it.
Well, we're not on the straw, of course, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we're not going to cry...
It is clear that those of the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
We continue and you will encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I still say it.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you look bad at what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the money is spent, money is used only to make money, that is to say, to do the greatest misfortune.
We're one of the richest 20%.
There is no doubt also 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth whose part is logically redistributed).
Fair taxation should enable these households to enjoy part of their efforts.
Or so lower your arms and live on social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the head cutters at the red Khmer have happily lived.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In either one, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any worries.
Just go to someone's house, sleep in it, pack up behind yourself and leave.
This will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You've just missed a lot of luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article mention Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a bill and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site that I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," the Bu$herie sang over all the tones...
So harmless weapons.
I am sure that this will please families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain clean).
Furthermore, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not super clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly enhanced if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And we should not be made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not seen because National Education does not have the means to provide a college/secondary office to its teachers, so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the board at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill out the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to get caught up with poorly educated lights whose parents crack at you while treating you as a handkerchief?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm jihadites so that the people of Khurde can better thrive.
That's where we see that the Bush administration has absolutely everything going through.
My first graduate job was in the sale in London to earn three times nothing and yet it was a post for which a degree was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, do not do so if you do not find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed in my graduate jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope to end up going both in public service and in the academic world.
LOL LOL This article really comes late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bisoning threads like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what are called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I've got one of those degrees and I've finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the above article says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but the levels are rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, to get to work in the hour and to interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bison lines?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media study or whatever the unknown course you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are true threads.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high schoolers, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise making 80km go back on bicycle every day to come to work in Paris.
The intra-mural and small-belt inhabitants already have many otherwise more practical means of common transport (métro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
In fact, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They also benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not all right.
When we talk to pedestrians and other public transport users about the reasons why they don't pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that appear to me are: 1/ it's hyper dangerous with all these washrooms, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and get away with the survival of bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the cycling tracks are pis go, you need to reduce the traffic (urban traffic type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the code of the road by speaking systematically (even the bicycles to the nearby bemol that you need to adapt the code of the road written for bathrooms 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the closed passage, not before the washrooms and scooters do not act.
The cycle tracks are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word on the bike's place in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% veil movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition to learning what OR reports, EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
It's not safe to love the way the world evolves.
Like a horrible look.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear him say that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, complaints should be filed first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be dismissed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result from it.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in which case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed earlier, Ukraine had launched into the area of air strikes against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay for the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurper government / Western Ukraine's ultra-nationalists - and who want to show by the way that Putin shot MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the rebel forces of Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not allow this case to go to the ICJ.
It is funny to think that Abbott means Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have said nothing of that.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco beotian, it's scary!
Calling Polar is losing the north is cheery.
One question: is today's poorer poorer poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book the most virulently didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production income, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term..
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this rug knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has a few limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss it without reading the book whose main aim is to argue solely in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you been reading it?
Is the central thesis of his pavilion summarized by the press false?
I didn't read it and I won't read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis and it's the one that seems to me to be fumistry.
The concept of difference between the rich and the poor is subsidiary.
Has not humanity been globally enriched?
And this added enrichment to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the price.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighbourhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom but mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Is Malala itself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have "announce time" on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, his father wasn't going to marry her when he was 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and to have the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, insofar as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that a middle Pakistani girl should often marry at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it in a sufficiently eloquent way for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little difficulty finding her figure of Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to the perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the Anachronique Life on Mars of Bowie is simply overwhelming.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all at once to look at 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of staging and mounting me.
In AHS there is an avalanche of original plans that ridicule today's assimilation of productions.
It's a little short of seeing you throw your sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to measure quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so, there are many other things.
It's just not that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series hangs in writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 American Horror Story seasons or it's gonna end like 24 hours of what.
But everyone does what they want!
That's why I say "I won't look anymore" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk about less tax increases, please - let's cut in government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know about spending failed.
triggering controversy about relatively small expenditure posts, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of orientation that voters seem to call for their wishes and for all this time certain, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditures.
"Debt" is assets primarily held by financial institutions in that country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking over a third of my income (even before I talk about consumer taxes) if I thought he was going to use it for good.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, about unnecessary wind turbine subsidies and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get to a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Lib-Dem look very ridiculous about the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per year will pay around £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays around £70,000 (a little more than one third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it is before VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paying decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of books of taxes pass.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Still, 20% of the unemployed wouldn't look, which means 80% are looking for and don't find.
Being unemployed myself, do I care more about what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of doing so.
Did I actually not have any news about the Employment Pole for months, which means that agents are more busy with control operations than really getting job announcements back?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough posts, then you have to get away from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed do their duty in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title to users of a means of transport, a head of service or the employees of their work, etc.
No one calls the scandal in these cases, right?
It is worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been misestablished, and on one of the cases, which had been amputated by 40%, it had to be fought firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Registration and control are currently taking over, while Statutoryly the Employment Pole is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, who pay the fees.
Non-wage politicians and French workers are granted rights that they do not in fact have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is involved in the enhancement of paid work.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this area of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at that time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban the Hadj in Mecca this year from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent the sick of Ebola from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple sense but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in forty-one strict.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa although they had taken “all necessary precautions”.
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be placed immediately in quarantine.
May he pass the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace.
I doubt that he is able to construct in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the functioning planet.
He's still far from that design here.
It's only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while the religion, coming out of the brain, leads our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the interest in becoming an integral Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet in the Church, there is only to see the few Protestants in France.
What's the next step, taking away the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sory the church does not have a limited vision of France.
And in the world, it may be that it will affect more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it pre-existing in the Christ.
Hillel a century earlier said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond mere reciprocity but introduces a·gaʹpe.
Your "progressing justice, peace, brotherhood" but without a god?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefineing the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the few Protestants in France are mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and driven to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not inventing.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fund-raiser campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% reduction, or does £30 include 20% reduction?
However, be careful: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but you can't play with it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll wipe it out of your library if they decide to be harsh against the people who buy it there while they're out of the region.

So, was France, 1940, a "prominent land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Is it necessary to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so selfish?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilian and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
Continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hail to the terrible ones.
Since I've been driving one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days' rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was brothels.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fanatics of CAMRA (not to confuse with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance to beginner I was able to leave with several decent marks.
I hope that if I get to 95 years old I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of lard on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without trying to upset you, I think you're moving a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, she prohibits searches for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She's reporting weapons traffic soon.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not keeping our eyes closed that we get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sense: all representative, Muslim or non-Muslim authorities, organizations or associations, having formally condemned the ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say a word consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly manifest themselves to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt.
In my view, this principle is the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delicacy of French society.
If there is no doubt, as much as to say.
Who doesn't say a word consents, but consents to what?
It consents to an proximity with IS or to the condemnation of IS.
Silence is practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to clean up the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that during the elections, Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are those threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland since there are no seats.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to shed a cry for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads to the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESIS" thinking he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish deputies.
It is no wonder that some Labour MPs are asking their leaders for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Clarifying 8 % pumps to the detriment of 85% is not a super-electoral strategy.
Furthermore, once Scottish Members are unable to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and that worked with him.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he has won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, by the way, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes your book based on your profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still read stolen files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without mochard.
Given the price I paid Kobo, it's without regrets.
I am relieved of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your general public bookstore, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding bosses whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.
For example, “Finnish Wake ” by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is so, that neither the readers nor the authors can be identified.
But Kobo has all this information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements from the Turkish government over the last few days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a bullet in its foot unless you win something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually taking a bullet in her foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of reprisals or simply counseling caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is truly surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*nneries balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations / earlier warnings coming from Iran to propose from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipelines policy moves the world towards the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial was needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it "necessary"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly about the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a crowded place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire.
What a delight!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real one.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that even beats in the womb of a mother carrier.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child's wish and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilized straight couples as well.
As for the children!
How ashamed to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for this lady's retirement (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It doesn't date today.
Many women have worn and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, so we're done...
The important thing is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, aren't cosmetics as good as body marketing? !
Anakronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in distant countries via the internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder its responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near home without screaming at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there the day 'cause I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like that and you listen to music - this music today still touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
Nothing is surprising that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things very well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can put an ear there if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I thought, too, "always the same story," but this is a little article that was well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and get off to Wallgate.
They're riding pills.
What the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes' walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonise (in fact, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative was angry and whispered: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower custody ...
That this is unpleasant to the anti-Israeli it is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translated: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always like this since the Policy is globalized ...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it lasts!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force report has enabled Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt that ?!!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyist blieves written by no other.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand said, or what Noam Chomsky said.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and innuctions (my 13-year-old daughter loves her well, which means that it's a matter of maturity).
A truly vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps the truths we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, that feeling will be increasingly widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifys some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but all this not voting story has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that to vote once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing essentially for particular interests, multinational companies and rich people, At no time does he just say to ignore politics completely because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that instead of just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more active politically at the local level, organizing movements, demonstrations, petitions, no matter and trying to influence politics from that point.
I do not say that I am necessarily in agreement with his solution (because I think that I am politically active by presenting his requests may go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are turnarounds that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is outraged to see all these condescending answers saying that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the trouble of voting and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to discuss what it really says rather than simply label it irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left on its own.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The need to slip a ballot in an ballot box every five years makes me very angry because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's statements are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and university students from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "supe-chomskyist blisseves".
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, even with the head hockey added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media, including the Guardian, for generations.
This "float" reveals, above all, to me that intellectual debate has not long been held in the RDVs of history where business historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have been impoverished for the benefit of condemned science po-types for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take a guilty, an emissary goat.
They develop one and the other of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emissary goats that are the key to the vault of their thought.
I believe rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship with each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or /liberary (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the State's guilt: without this guilt he does not stand.
Who says guilty, said elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Nor any support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of its god of then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny apologization.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by hard left-wing human sciences researchers who don't stand to move from relief to mantras, is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is without limit.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speaking violently anti-Whites.
My father's not happy about his eldest daughter dating a white girl.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads out of large cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
What I was told is that the Russians are mostly prejudiced against temporary workers without qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australians' views about the Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird for a stranger to tell me that I don't support the Chinese, when I met two of them in my life (one abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all the people were brave and, in fact, those in London were very nice is the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, everyone is worth it, how do we remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here were talking about Chinese as some kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're still dating that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches in comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly left marked as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: pardon, but the judiciary is frankly branded right.
When at the Union of the Judiciary, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The observer's political vision as well as the judge's factual interpretation.
At that time, the law's required tool for refocusing the assessment on fundamentals remains.
The measurement of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, forces a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice were not divided between these three groups.
The claim and lack of knowledge is not subject to objective analysis.
So if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only through statistics that reveal implicitly that it starts from low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The one about corruption* from the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is that of the removal* of heirs committed up to the use of frauds to the procedure* by successor genealogists commissioned by notaries.
This profession obtains a good year in 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in numerous disputes between genealogist and heiress who are reluctant to get rid of, a whole set of caselaws contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring this type of rational criteria not a form of lie developed?
Totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to hack the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these ground tricycles, built to measure its size and weight and it has really allowed him to enjoy the open air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires covered, could not.
Like we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIC.
I think the inventor of the Whit never had to clean a dog's hook on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the whole tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard pendant.
Here there are hills that they would like.
Prices look really high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The tricycle of all terrain seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available to them.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know properly that they are necessary for us.
We can't really say that the Whit is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not expected to make it.
I'M CONTENT that the long distance wheelchair does not reach the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been captured from the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockades!
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Ah, it's not wood tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are here to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been held captive by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-preserved land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Don't forget as well that after raising it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, not for profit.
Many are looking for only one night's blow on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hope) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
"What does it rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, if you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the ship, make sure it is 100% consistent with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers for permission to engage in commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse).I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Did you think that ships can be moved, stolen and repainted, glued, etc?

No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one who exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to collapse!
High finance, speculature, therefore, plays with our companies our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, our food, therefore our health care structures, with our debts our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of those hyper-mega-obsessed money.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed an old minister of the economy of the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competing?
You call it how to turn his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't know much about what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British leather in the area.
The sea was stinky at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being dried up, you see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick research on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two curated cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after stopping the shooting, and a race-forward began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but when he got closer, he saw it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, weighed and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlamps on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 2215.
Concerned about reports indicating a British leather in the vicinity, he headed north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, didn't know that a ship had flowed, so they couldn't search for survivors.
They also thought there was a more important seam in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they germinated to take advantage of their progress.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes were raised at the PUM to request that it be included in the law that a finally sentenced election be therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing electors of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED TO INSTRUCT ON THE CONSENTS OF MAGISTERS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Maintained by (es) politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to love those who will take advantage of their inmobility to hinder the actions of true policies, who really try to move things, not the beautiful parlors whose immobilism is sufficient.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small banners" of the bass for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicised unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in their service to their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing unions, or even extreme right-wing unions, designated personalities on its board as targets and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free.
If, at present, the right-wing defrays the news of justice, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been paid attention to it have not had a favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judicial union and is minority.
May a minister support trade unions with so much commitment show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be minority among magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it's not a secret.
We are now wondering whether the "mission" of certain judges is no longer going out rather than instructing.
@gus - You should be satisfied, MS is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Wassel.
I think even the weakest one in glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directions fill the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed with the Eurovision, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in US competitions.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into the background.
But this is what happens anyway to most stars who do not participate in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock road, even though in your dreams you think that all the guitar vibes that smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even go out an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the people studied – distance that turns rather quickly to racism, because the sacralistic ethnologists present us these people as infinitely superstitious and petri of ritual mustaches, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, such as ours, practical everyday considerations.
Unless you interpret inadvertently in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a sort of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article whatever.
It's the ephemeral deco to move the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would lead to not at all scientific interpretations that last a mandarin's life, rarely less.
When does a comparative criticism of disciplines make us laugh a little?
Because what is good for archaeology also applies to interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is totally unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be deceived.
Today we have so powerful technical and scientific means that the interpreting of searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
There is controversy (and old) about the shamanism advanced by Prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The Chamans of Prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published at the La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this very instructive article
Does straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could go.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we keep three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a play up there.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy up there, on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost finished, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real journalists, brave, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and risks.
Rather than sneezing with these dirty ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on then.
If these "poor ass jokes" shock you so, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is fully possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people make fun of it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...???
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have left the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. the decapitator) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew he was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV, pub, money...).
But apart from that they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM gets the SC in, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restaurant to beat the English that then led...
You're leaving my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to get through all your c********ries.
No, just not.
There were lots of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a distant history of the possibility of winning one pilot at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image allows the AIF to avoid disturbing questions of the type: How does the Commissioner shake a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the Commissioners clearly sees a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that more is under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, from which the shaken green flag.
It's the usual procedure.
The post of commissioners just downstream of the accident (as appropriate, it can be 10 meters as much as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to take back a normal look.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just for money.
And sex, don't forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, pub and media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Making fun with information that we don't really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people to keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids touch about Ebola, we catch all the fear" That should be "derailing", not "smoothing."
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who are suffering that Ebola could start to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules beautifully and firmly this pseudo-journalism abject.
It made me laugh.
I'm sad that the media are talking about most of the things with this optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without succeeding in hysteria) so that the government can make us unravel when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of being ruled by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
Also at the beginning this must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through for years .....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a bad influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trade: Testimonials cannot serve as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking patients in psychiatry when we have reliable comments from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
So what are you looking for, then?
About ghosts?
Are you putting the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word canon flattered by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ensembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty-of-sense buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrilnik hit us with "resilence".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have framed a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to emerge from the air Sentinels...
And why?
It was a great series, and it looks like those who come up with it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the all-powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humor of the genus pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mystery.
So keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if we do not see the sons and that animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although I am an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain of recasting the old.
The series almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we have one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at these times.
And in addition, half an hour episodes now pass at 05:30 a.m., Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
Radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all Israeli searches below and around the Esplanade mosque for decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Maybe it's in Argentine?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad is mounted in paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and unfortunately they are related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and has served it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful Jerusalem's annexation is.
Will God recognize his people?
The shortest Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
In order to boast of tourism in Israel, we are often seen by young Naiadas half-devested, English on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary though.
And this picture is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a shame that the photographer of Reuters did not photograph the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to enter the Mount of the Temple and who preferred to cascade the Jewish faithful in contrabas, praying to the Wall for regrets.
@Mat, If this picture bothers you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits must be condemned.
This system is not tense and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is to revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone wild, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenacious, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grudging and groaning when someone else does the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike concerns not only their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being cleansed of impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All of this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (CIP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people in short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated on your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes a great deal of impact, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman was right, in the 18th there were unions in all regiments
In the very French armed Catholic, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave there (at last, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, briefly: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even though for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
They still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicating myself.
You're warned, it's your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the groups, the protected professions with trade unions have already undergone quite a lot, which has created a break-up of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of a staff member's risk.
One can well imagine a system that guarantees a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
No disaster assured.
And with the carts ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I referred to the military and other civil servants, since this is the subject here commented...
Let's delete "through his delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review".????
Wait, the section was here, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I've been watching, and I can tell you that some of them have been well-seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding one has one of the best moments (who is misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in line that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has made "boum, here my fucking cake now eat it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these outsiders were kept out of the way.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I don't think I can influence that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us super entertainment and encourage us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them and they had to brib one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real fault they could have found was the very dry base (even if I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glazing on Richard's mill did not give any desire, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time given.
There's also cancer watching, with the solar blow.
It's definitely all working out for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer that is precisely formed by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "hull out" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a resident when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the comment, which he himself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I'm a melanoma habit, UV only accelerates its development.
They don't provoke him.
For proof: not all bronzed persons must have melanomas.
Either, when a tubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for all humans.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or passing it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted iPhone6 as a front-line communication material.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that anything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
It's the fourth joke on the fold I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can't see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Most likely, this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore matched with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or EC logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that industrialists produce in » industrials' We put forward super u but all the signs and even the small trade are concerned How to cook good, bio avac €1650 (medium salary in French)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For my part, the diet is one.
Go without resentment, I kiss you.
It is called bobos, or better boboecoli, people who see the world through ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-reason disgruntling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
He is also an expert in tartuferia, joining the left-caviar, of which they are sometimes out, for example by condemning the releases of CO2 while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferia as well do not be surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all the associated details (aircraft, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecoles are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in eco-friendlys very quickly.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the echoes because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front of him.
She's so badly hurt she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic abilities.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a fact.
Rather, it's an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic dog reproductions that smoke by playing billiards.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real one.
If you're looking for this, a camera will do the thing.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of horses in the republican custody or the status of generals who are no longer in active service...
L(honesty requires that France decreases its strength, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more dramatically, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operator without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, as we observe weaknesses, shortcomings in our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even some of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: that's what I'm saying, look elsewhere to save money, but especially not at my house, it's really not possible at my house...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the library is sure.
That all those who have barely or enough the military thing dare come to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will get a little better.
And for Josi: really rebound: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other departments and you will understand why Defense can feel a little charged!
Yes, the economies that everyone agrees on saying they have to do it, must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls are moaning at murder when it happens to them, the poor dear ones.
It would have to be done, but above all, it will not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history is repeated at each post closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's weird, a mayor who wants compensation and does not welcome savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most exhilarating thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is depressing to have her Facebook thread parade and to see that 80% of her friends began their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
He will certainly be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus by going to work and realizes only where his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely fucked up.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling apart!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter to finally have the lighting and discover the incredible brightness and insurmountable genius that flows from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise in effective regional policies and association initiatives.
Until new orders we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner that they have planted in energy, all these good recommendations have flown away ....
Translate: Windmills and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the con-tributable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much worse at the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided of course it drastically reduces our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by wind renewable or PV is already more GHG on the other steps and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
Replacing nuclear with wind renewable or PV would be against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in Physics 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I have said.
As for what I didn't say it was you who lent me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't answer what I was saying and how all the people on the right demolition the interlocutor I never did.
I also mention the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
If you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the vapour of greenhouse gas with less effect that the Co2 is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapor and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "generous South Asia"...!!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindus.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your mind.
It would have been the same if they had qualified India as a giant in South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a pandore box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletic imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India dedicates to the Cricket of the IPL and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "noisy neighbours"...
The low-cost launch race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible lack of design only occurs with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a design defect, but implementation...
unlike arianspace which is a private company, it seems that soyoz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer..
They may be going to pay satellites in frigates that know..
This is all the more annoying that many media loop the only titles of articles - and many readers only retain these titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
While agreeing with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project while it is only a launch problem.
