One of the reasons why Twitter is so popular in Japan is a very characteristic of Japanese: Japanese uses ideograms that allow to convey more information in 140 characters than other languages, without considering Chinese. Among other things, the Japanese version of this sentence is written with exactly 140 characters. How many characters do we need in other languages?
They ruined him.

Can I have the bill, please?

Can I get them?
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
It's a Hindu name.
Drink too much.
I just went to my uncle's.
I just need a hug.
Tom was too young to do that.
You guys are good.
We finally published the book.
I'd rather die than marry you!
I could never hurt Tom.
You think so?
It didn't happen much.
We should let them know.

The police are looking for you.
Have you ever visited Boston?
Always go straight.
I'm the one who helped Tom.
It is extremely surprising.
Why do you always talk to me in English?
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I'd like a map of the city.
Tom was singing.
You think you'd never imagine killing yourself?
Why are you reading it?
This doesn't have to happen again.
You don't have to know why I did it.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
Pphirsichbaeumchen wants to learn beer.
Tom's not watching TV right now.
Respect is the basis of life.
Today this is no longer so.
What a tall guy he is!

Tom went to prison.
He's reading a novel.
There were a lot of people on the street.
You forgot to write them.

I was afraid to fall asleep while driving.
If he can't beat them, join them.
Where did you put the car key?
She played.
Nobody knows.
I'll do what I have to do.
I never stopped loving Tom.
My father's been dead for three years.
I was about to surprise you.
It's too simple.
Why don't you work harder?

We need to help them.
You have a lot of enemies.
You look a little nervous.
You also ignore the most basic notions of science.
I guess it makes sense to go ahead and pay the bill now.
Have you ever gone out with them?
Tom decided to slow down.
That would have been terrible.
We need to do our best to change things.
The boy was fixing a carp bench in the pond.
I didn't need your help.

Is it okay if we eat outside tonight?
I worked with an annual contract.
They just wanted to be left alone.
Who's going to Boston with her?
I see my crown.

Nobody wants to play with her.
Take a look at that woman!
I'm not answering stupid questions.
We sing together often.
There's a package for Tom on my desk.
Do you regret it?
I sent him home.
Did you pull all the shirts?
Sami will like Layla's soup.

"Where would you like to work?" "In Australia."
I can't blame them.
How do you explain it?
I immediately put on my shoes.
I haven't seen him in a while.
Tom's doing very well in French.
It gives her a lot.
Do you love your wife?
Tom's not contributing, is he?
Tom ate a cheeseburger.
Tom didn't try to resist.
He made a mistake.
Stay with Tom.
Tom's almost as tall as you are.
He came with me.
I spend a lot of time in Australia.
It's silly, isn't it?
She wasn't your sister.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
This object is currently exhausted.
Tom's very resourceful.
He won't believe what happened today.
Can I take a picture of her?
I forgot your name.
We called our white dog.
Sami was drugging Layla.
It is not the length of life, but its depth.
It's so stupid, I swear I can't stand it.
We'll take it.
Do you really trust her?
I know a girl who always smiles.
I would never betray his trust.
Tom understands what I mean, I think.
I wish Tom was here with us today.
I don't remember my father's face precisely.
He's washing his car.
Tom's not about to give up now.
You threw your sponge.
How does he dare to have sex with my wife?
He threw the ball first.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are satisfied.
She's not interested in her English lessons.
I had fun last night.
Tom doesn't want her to.
Tom's rich, but he's not happy.
Bring the table out, please.
That's great stuff.
I did what I was asked to do.
I keep writing to Tom sometimes.
We just have to find him.
Can I see you again?
Let us resolve this problem together.
Is this the first time you've done this?
Should I give this to Tom?
Do you have any friends?
He helped him.
You're really annoying.
The rest is history.
Tom's used to staying up all night.
We're not leaving soon.
We could be caught.
So you have hair on your chest after all.
I just need a minute.
What color were they?
You're a weird guy.
We don't have to talk in the library.
I want my daughters to learn to speak French.
I'm shocked.
I doubt Tom's single.
You've eaten enough.
They've lost ten row games since their winnings ended.
I'll take care of her.
Sami speaks a little Arabic, but he doesn't know how to read it.

Where did you take them?
You didn't have to hurry.

You're still in the first guns!
I won't bother you anymore.
This box contains apples.
Can Tom do it for us?
If you have time, let's go shopping.
Are you home now?
I thought I'd go with her.
Hey guys, I think I found something.
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
I can't trust you.
Tom looks nervous.
Which course is recommended?
The long journey made his accident worse.
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
He did what he was told.
Tom gave Mary a banana.
Is it legal?
He doesn't know I'm Japanese.
We really had a good time.
We should let her rest.
Nothing lasts forever.
I know you don't know them.
Please, bring us two cups of coffee.
I still have friends in Boston.
Were you jealous of them?
I'm sure Tom's not Canadian.
I want to be safe.
Tomorrow begins.
Can you speak Esperanto?
I'll see you again next Friday.
In modern computer systems, umlaut and dieresis are represented in the same way.

The bird flies.
Can I call you tomorrow?
He lives in Kyoto.
Stay close to Tom.
He hates curry.
He writes in Arabic.

I'm very upset.
Bring me a glass of water, please.

I arrived at Osaka Station at night.
Why are your eyes so big?
This big warehouse is closed at seven.
I never liked school.

He likes snow.
He raised his arm.
Where'd you get them?
Aren't you cute?
Where did he learn German?
I don't need a doctor.

Have you been to Nashville?
How many credits is this course?
Nevertheless, I am not good at speaking in English.
Keep driving.
We stopped her.
He's good in French, isn't he?
I can't talk to him.
Tom invited Mary to his house.
He's got nothing on him.
He promised not to be late again.
Roosevelt died before the end of the war.

Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Take a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was going smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, if God wills, we'll be with your parents.
He's coming from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like smooth fish.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated her.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm old.
I have the dirty criminal feder.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us some funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming along.
Don't say anything like that.
Badly worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did good here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He has become involved in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still away.
I ate all the apple.
Swallow the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare uighur food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom played football.
Stop rocking.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them that?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
Doesn't look too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's angry, isn't he?
Does this cage aim to protect from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm loyal.
Can he write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they're talking French.
Step forward.
You need to become more active.
Tom and Mary are they kidding?
He broke the smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will this summer do?
He got irritated.
You know how to speak shanghainese?
He narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much has it been paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to you at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You need to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Search Google harder!
It's not the only problem of your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Do you look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Are you playing any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom's got the knife.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When does his new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
Today it's snowing.
He promised to write me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give you 50,000 for this statue." "Who will offer you more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very funny at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my work.
I'd suggest you be more cautious.
She's upset.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
He'll squirm in the afternoon.
He's gone blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I would like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still sleeping.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
Must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use more?
Turn on the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before we came to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German machines are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Maria's opinions.
She'll have the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
You really think Tom's good?
I can't give Mary anything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
Do you know how to ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of sugar-free tea.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalosis!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your tongue.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're in advance again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm in the hospital. I was hit by lightning.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us? We are in Europe!
I was waiting for a bus to arrive.
He found the monkey.
You'll never guess where they are.
I didn't do well.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church at Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning how to drive.
You know I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut down the branch with an axe.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner walking on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for more than ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting me home with an ammoniac home appliances attracts me a lot.
Judy's a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run behind the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't you just buy her a hat?
I thought Tom would be alive.
She's just a little crazy about the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
You like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You're charming.
People drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go wake them up.
What tooth hurts?
We need to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little confused about Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe a word you say.
Get off of me!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You're vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help you.
They called us.
I think Tom must be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
She's back!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are catching the ground.
The park is closed Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do this now?
They like all my friends.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's evolution theory?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth a visit to the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom took the bags out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your license plate number?
He told us a lie.
You have seven children.
Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with you.
We have to delay our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's very soon.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Read this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be fine. Don't worry.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget his smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know any Canadians who live in Australia?
Tom's boring, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want me to do, Tom?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
You turned off your computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered that.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door shut.
He made him drunk.
How do you feel today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom came to Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I don't feel nervous.
She's got a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you doing this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his swing reached the still Fido.
Tom's engaged to my older sister.
My father always gets stuck in my private life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about going out for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in markets.
They shot him.
Sorry about the inconvenience.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want you to see this.
How many kidneys does a human being have?
A saved balance is a earned balance.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It's red.
Don't bother him.
We were good.
She started acting strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're random.
Please put down the music.
I'm training Tom for work.
He was watching him swim.
Who broke the pot?
You'd better go with him.
The queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The kids played together.
Say it again, please.
You're bothering her.
Sami's not here to ruin your day.
Take off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Those are yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
The people here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close the beats if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of speech.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom provided a new technique.
Did you guys get thuged?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a user store.
Why don't you do it alone?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't make any sense.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates bats.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
No one's seen them do it.
Tom didn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You came too soon.
He's capable of speaking ten languages.
Come home before it gets dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated the French at the top.
Shouldn't you be home with your mother?
He's got blue eyes and blonde hair.
I can't understand that.
Tell him who you are.
My name looks weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Be glad! Add an exclamation point to all your phrases!
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought myself a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They're traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll help you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long have you lived in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a golden boy.
It seems to be prevented against ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me puke.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give me the order.
Do you know Canadians who live in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock has been moved with dynamite.
Mary prepared breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She's become famous.
What are you indicating?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
You put the balloon on.
We have to go.
Staying home isn't fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like your son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
It was nice to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much card do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
We eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Take the picture.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where'd you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
Even June is not so far away.
Why does Tom hate you so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He threw me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
You always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't mess with Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I've been in danger.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, don't you?
It wasn't my idea to take them.
Last night my grandmother missed without suffering.
I know why you're mad at them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can read Spanish easily.
Should I use ink?
Don't fall from the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
Can't Tom swim?
Children usually get up early on Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look awkward?
I can't do anything for you.
Dad's good.
I think they're ready.
Tom's gonna try again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a table game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something before.
The job leaves traces on Tatoeba...
You like carrots?
I have dolls every thirty minutes.
Tom's a lot older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's pessimistic.
He's got to help them.
Sometimes I write to my mother.
Don't trust anyone.
I regret never being kind to him.
Make Tom call me.
It didn't change anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Of twenty students, only one has read the book.
To love someone means to see him as God meant it.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with you?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure if George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify.
Let us go.
It would be nice to spend summer in the mountains.
I lost him.
I almost dropped the dishes.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom made up 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week was nice.
You want a tray with that?
She doesn't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we do it?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's in the back.
We can't let them die.
It's a bunch of nerves.
Tom was late.
Tom's back.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your holidays?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary did it right.
Have you ever talked to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you get back from London?
Tom's always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom sneered for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A snake bites Tom.
I don't care.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.
He likes football.
Tom lives next to Mary.
I have to go to Boston next week.
Show them how to do it.
What is your favorite fruit?
You like golf?
What is your favorite kind of pizza?
He's not very good at his job.
Bob has a lot of books in his room.
Tom followed.
The ship disappeared on the horizon.
Of course you told a lie.
Something was happening.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally ran into Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot her number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be frank?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, please bring him home.
May all your desires be fulfilled!
He's already done it.
He is experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
His table is ready.
Is there going to be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, right?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Do your business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling a story.
You have homesickness, don't you?
What will you eat tomorrow?
I've seen the movie before.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could take.
Are they Tom and Mary?
There is no future in its use.
Tom and I often study together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like to travel?
I want to go back to Tom's.
He has strong principles.
He was buried in this cemetery.
Again, bye.
Good to meet you here.
Are you waiting for someone?
You're an over-optimist girl.
Is this your umbrella?
I don't know three languages.
Tom called it bankrupt.
We need to sleep.

Fixing your mind obsessively on whatever is considered disease.
