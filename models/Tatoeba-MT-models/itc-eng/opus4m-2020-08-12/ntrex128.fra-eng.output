Members of the Assembly of Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
A proposal to replace their titles with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) was followed by a proposal to replace their titles.
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the Assembly's name, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rallies.
An elected worker indicated that his group was concerned that the phrase "to rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Galles readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crutch.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Parti of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced the letter u in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change of name, indicated that “the final decision concerning the appointment of members of the Assembly is theirs”.
The Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act 2017) Act 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is looking for members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but a large majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real head office for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the change in country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now bear the name "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve an old dispute of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long stressed that the name Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that changing names is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal for the bars to go rarely.
Today, "we don't have the same dates anymore," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar as well as to her neighbor, but that's not the case."
As for churches, funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what the leaders imagine, and this concerns him: " sooner or later, they will return to the starting box".
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be mostly whites who will precipitate the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white Methodist Congregation abandoned places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching to the surrounding area, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops of the 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks painted to be employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor in the direction of the church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor people".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin didn't replace him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of questions about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body made up of secular officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing in lobster in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paying up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming for joy having a catch, and then he understood that he really did.
It had been bitten.
As he arrived near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I cried for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim was traumatized on the top of the chest.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them are considered as non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetic market
Sainsbury's hands low on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetic market of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the previously occupied space by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also boosts its boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will test concessions in two shops in Sainsbury's, the first open last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and a second opened in the course of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to grow their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to make their online purchases and to go to nearby food stores for daily foods.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales outlets will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter stores discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which according to the group has enabled the sale of common consumer goods and the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the British chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetic product rays had resulted in a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended up following a controversy about the distribution of benefits from the pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
It was after having sold 281 pharmacies 3 years ago that the new strategy was implemented in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical Chain.
Lloyds was supposed to play a role in it that consisted of introducing in 4 stores a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now unquestionable and changes the purchasing habits," added Mr. Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of £11 million
Star Corross of the Dragon's Den TV Program, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the Animation Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million related to its home decorating brand, to dedicate to its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At age 37, this Morning's animator announced on Instagram that she withdrew.
Holly Willoughby furiously made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was furious when the child dear to the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the trading empire of Dragon's Den Star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to £1.5 million, would no longer allow him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and in the process of ensuring its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s seat is full of products ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's animator, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in cushions or candles, indoor clothing or items, and the risk of delayed launch.
Moreover, this could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, had been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owned 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand-name ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an entertainer of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source near Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was horrifying, but we finally love each other.
Trump has mocked the media who criticize him for his comment that some people consider "indignified by a president" and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give in so much?"
He's filming, taking a voice from a TV reporter.
"I have not yielded at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, from a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than 3 months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho declared Saturday to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly no "response" of the United States to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
On the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump assembly speech offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says North American President.
We have led to the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and remnants of North American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs were not supposed to have needed assistance.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been decreed, a condition required for the launching of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have many times made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to go to Palu, it still does not know whether work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the shocks he constantly suffered, the country was cruelly deprived of means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refuges have been built in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren remained in Palu, which may have contributed to human loss.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not simple.
Natural disasters make transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been posted in Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the weakened infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable amounts on repairing roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds threatened Mr. Joko's government, which was called upon to represent the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, on the basis of clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: The Attacker of Liverpool Daniel Sturridge manages to match Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goals, and its team was run from 1 to 0.
He shoots in the ball on his left before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before moving to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reaches Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its way to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to put myself in, grab the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1 to 0 in the middle of the day after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker climbed a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before moving towards the middle of the field and spraying Liverpool side.
Kovacic realized a quick va-and-coming in the middle of the field,
then made a wonderful deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a shot from the left foot behind the doorman of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the group phase of the Champions League, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe League of UEFA, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: the number of tsunami victims is 832
The Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning that the assessment of the earthquake and tsunami reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was littered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 7:55 p.m., the 44-year-old woman with knife blows was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the inhabitants of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The captain of the police, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask any person around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything from a suspect to contact us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their Dashcam and ask them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman presented themselves at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is under way and the police have indicated that they informed their parents close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
One police officer said that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
Repeating: "It's too horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were posted inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the interior side of the cordon.
Anyone who has information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crime Failure Agency at 0800 555 111, as recorded in record 247 of September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, given the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and described it as "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says that, "in view of the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's building in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said at Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of course the monarchy.
Whether or not this representation is accurate is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South-East China market.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a dirt market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, said on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pigry on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighboring junkyard was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg and has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the cousin of the breeder, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was neither owned by the breeder nor by his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting her husband.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig stuck a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from him.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause such behaviour.
"They are rather playing animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of harming.
Just show them the respect they deserve," he says.
The remains of hurricane Rosa should cause severe precipitation in the south-east of the United States
According to forecasts, hurricane Rosa weakens as it travels over the coldest waters on the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to adverse events in north-eastern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
The winds blew at 135 km/h (class 1 hurricane) from 5 a.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and flows east, west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a storm, hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the southwest of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 cm and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden crudes, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The strokes will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the south-west, including a large part of Arizona.
Dissipated tropical rains are likely to cause submerged floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intense rains could convert canyons into torn rivers and storms will produce gusts of wind and dust peat in locations.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the Californian coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flow and make the socks slippery.
It could be the first rains of the region's dry season.
Dispersed tropical spills will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall on the four corners of the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the refreshing of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will undergo significant temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will force you to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the center and east of the United States are expected to have a hot October start, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other north-east regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
The day-to-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
On 6 television stations Thursday, the overwhelming auditions of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual program on Friday to announce a theatrical coup: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford made sure to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh, as a result of alcohol, had committed assaults on his person and had tried to take off his clothes during a night between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of over 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the channel most watched during the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was finished.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken by demonstrators while attempting to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of live interrogation.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," throws one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors had closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say so more at the Committee meeting.
All the wired and broadcast network channels covered the meeting on-line a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the whole Senate.
However, Flake indicated that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the charges against the candidate, which the minority democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after having met with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice was heavy in the balance sheet, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making "small politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making "small politics" at the expense of Britain's future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May under cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his so-called Czechers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "just ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to be the cause of the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a fatal shot suspect who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten and accused of second-degree murder, reported Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the change.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the doctor of law in the parish of Baton-Rede published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and stayed in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the State Police Medical-Legal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement for their "commitment and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m per 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 bounces per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "devastated and in shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We're always repeating this type of event," Wade regretted.
Mexico: an ash crack volcano
From the ashes escaping the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, having recorded a peak activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity at the level of the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and the separatists approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona following clashes between independent protestors and the anti-emitting police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being refouled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not fill tourists.
Heat heaters also exploded later in the day, while the police used bricks to contain clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence were calling for "no forgetting, no forgiveness" and faced with unionist supporters shouting "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain still alive in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low rate of participation, the secession opponents who largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independentist groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
This was quite the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope of independence from Catalonia.
"We were witnesses last year of a great moment.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a dead end," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although thin, at the regional elections last December, independent Catalan parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the demonstration of police support on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, both on the one hand and on the other.
"The tension is only rising," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for a trial last year, announced his intention to apply for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men striking a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7.30 p.m. local time.
Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins game 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal is to win Livingston
Recently ranked, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games at Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
The goal of Menga made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to rank in second position, on an equal basis with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside Premiership league this season, and they must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads to 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends its 6-game course in the division, and its main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may be proud to have not yet lost the slightest meeting.
Livingston missed an opportunity in front of moussed opponents
Holt's team could have made progress long before they started, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to go through but remained smooth in the face of the other purpose; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could upset them by working tactics.
That's where the ultimate goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to catch Menga, who took a touch and recorded a goal in the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop on Kelly.
Ranger Allan McGregor's guard stopped kicking Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
The Keeper of Livingston rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a lack of hands.
Livingston’s “frequency” - Analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit is largely to Holt for having since his motivated arrival a team
who has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in Haleine throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talents.
They missed one last opportunity and managed only to cross the other side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the picture.
Home mixed by President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, have made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10.15 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent Deptford road south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police reported that officers were doing their best to identify the individual and prevent his/her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been set up. It is recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured during riot
The senior security officer said that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The riot began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09:30 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized riot officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for slight facial injuries.
A prison management spokesperson said: "Strained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. The officials will have to answer the police authorities and they will be able to see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot agents were sent to prison to halt a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked personnel with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by steep crudes (which could be beneficial to drought-affected areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to touch Arizona, but this is probably what will happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the desert of the south-west with what remains of its energy. This region could be affected by sudden crusades.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcement rains from Monday evening.
The national weather service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates at the National Hurricane Center include 5-10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the south-west desert including the Central Rocky Zone and the Great Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected regions that are not exposed to the risk of sudden decline.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial to the south-west region, given the current drought.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona had at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," says weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa begins its way on the coast, on the peninsula of Basse-Californie.
Always with great power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 cm and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and will reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Global rains are expected in Lower California, northwest of Sonora and in the south-west desert and are the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
These rainfalls are expected to result in potential fatalities and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the charge of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday about 4 a.m. Local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset reported having arrested the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) on the night of Radstock.
Officers called people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been a victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first decision-making procedure vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement by a member of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities said that at least 384 people had died, most of them being carried away by huge waves that fell on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celébes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when six-metre high waves submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't run away immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. He drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved across the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, as well as a water-covered mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have widened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the ruins of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be greater than 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dojaka, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" from Dojaga, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading the information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents said the waves had arrived while the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man upstairs of a building frenzied with street passersby that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the images immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general power failure that cut all communications to Palu. It was therefore difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to send aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has reopened in the context of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The tsunami victim's assessment is increasing, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff of Dojaka arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman wallowing under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagei.
"As an elder in the discipline of the paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon reported that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtly $26,750 when recharging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the vehicle emptied a distributor into the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a money bag for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone who has information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The Kanye West rapper is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Oldly known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, named Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the program.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West explained earlier this year, mentioning the title of his album with his Big Boy host.
“So I’m you, I’m us.
I passed from Kanye, which means "the only one", to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, confusion, of everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, also played on the union trait and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco's place to "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a pacifist event, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly allowances to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made IA announcements, while an official IA strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leader in innovation AI by 2030.
"Dubling funds for research in the field of IA would be a good start, as all other countries have a long run on the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," says Lee.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key IA step in the U.S. field, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then joined Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns university leaders, it's business," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major academic names to work on the IA.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. IA efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers," he said.
The Council of State Affairs of China unveiled its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," explained Lee.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year for research in IA.
At the same time, American legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard at a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute with Greece for several decades, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population of Macedonia, a majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has escaped the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament affirmed that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 a.m.
But participation was only 16 per cent, while it had reached 34 per cent at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of the voter members at the end of the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who boycott the referendum.
"We want to go into the EU and NATO, but we want to go through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments. The country's unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be favorable, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after he filed his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of the voting participants said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to pro-West government policy since its takeover last May.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, steps a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine winner received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He circled around a defender before evicting the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's keeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a few problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was marked at this time."
But Sterling had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the First League game,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 1255 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the party riots against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to run into a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of an elimination match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday night, but they always seek to secure their title as first division.
"Even if this game is not at stake, we want to cross the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and facing a team that will probably play at the highest level I have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
Nationals still have to announce a launcher starting on Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave their place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The right-wing of Washington is 18-7 with an average of 2,53 points and 300 withdrawals on 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation he had generated in support of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care who they hurt, whom they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on mission to "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before calling the Democrats "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Justice Committee of the United States Senate and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which was the result of a public horrification.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you disclosed the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians from the Labour Party considered not to be welcome, all for having expressed our ideas.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received identical treatment because she rose up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting Friday said: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday evening during my eight-year term as a Labour Party parliamentarian were.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today of many gatherings and the promise of more gentle and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I thought I shared a common political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take positions against my convictions, whether it relates to the national security or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I followed an abusive tremor on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had received were of a political nature.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a dismal talk of sexists or racists every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in today's policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted by the motions of challenge and changes to the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years: lowering your eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think it is not really time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a parliamentary member of the Nottingham East electoral district.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invincible
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt above: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense game day of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only team defeated by the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they seize the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
"So far we have been tested. But we remain invincus, so I must feel happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they were more effective than us and they were able to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's trial, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the right position, but a yellow card for the Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the figures speak. Jason Baggot took a non-transformed test.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time. He marked and turned a solo test to mount the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started well in the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait followed due to a serious wound from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a sawmill. At the recovery, Ayr resumed the fronts with a staff test McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose attempted his chance with an unprocessed test of Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team took over by hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having shut down Climo while he didn't have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's dick, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wing away for the fifth trial of the home team.
Still Game Star Launches in Restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-exists with his long-standing partner, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series coming will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path towards the Pacific
Marines patrol a armoured boat in the La Paz Naval Headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Titicaca Lake to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea comes back to us by law.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present. Just like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so clear for decades. Bolivia is indeed awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be made on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to a positive outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large-screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia's application. Bolivia wants Chile, after decades of sporadic negotiations, to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial struggle for the re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Chile, and that few things would change, even in case of a positive decision.
The United Nations instance based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," explains Paz Zárate, an expert Chilean in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, perhaps the last four years have caused him injury.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has dug up all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also questioned the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political beck and call.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country did not defend its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called upon the United States to abide by the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He expressed himself at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to relaunch a nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong One, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chemerical" to think that maintaining sanctions and the US opposition to a statement that will end the Korean war will bring the North to a halt.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant pre-emptive disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang's resignation of an arsenal that the country considers as the sole guarantee of its security is discussed.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest curfew trends, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, stop looking.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of ominous oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honored the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
All the more extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's lighthouse was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a broad edge evoking a feather, which covered the head of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-ready pastries, a magician hat and even an pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips stitched and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the High Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the stamp of the "Bomb", the broad straw hat that the stars pull out, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this hard-to-use hat that flooded the social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the bathroom jersey model that wore it.
The bag in burnt orange raffia, decorated with raffia fringes and a handle of white leather, was the master piece of the parade PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The celebrity styleist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential to People of the World · Global Voices
Scotland's independent schools maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with excellent new exam results enhanced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools are working to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum on measurement, we note that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of this year's exams, it can be seen that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of the students received the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of the students who studied German, 69% of the students who studied French and 63% of the students who studied Spanish.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as subjects are organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey of the British Employment and Skills Commission carried out in 2014 revealed that among the challenges faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to skills in insufficient languages.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to have a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important for the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, no matter what their future holds.
It is clear that, in a global trading environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look at the beginnings of LeBron James at the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few limited minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his pre-season plans, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to be ready."
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (Youtube Channel)
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, especially in states such as Tennessee and the Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the vote on confirmation of the vacant post to the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump sought support for the upcoming mid-term elections and prevented Republicans from losing control of the Congress at the time of the vote in November.
At what time does the Trump meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidates' hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans win the ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president thus stated in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and partisans while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will return to as many states as possible at the beginning of this election campaign," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday, this will be the second visit in one month of Trump to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political science specialist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team is ready to fight to keep hope close to the simple Sunday
After three simple, the ants on Saturday afternoon could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing movement of the momentum is a sports concept invented from all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
Where, then, would they put the momentum now?
"They were going with six points in advance and now four, so that gives us some wings," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points in advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a bit of a doll wind and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can strive to have each three out of four points.
Spieth has shown himself terribly effective from tea to green and set the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game advanced. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize to the fourth part while Thomas and took him two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game at the 15th hole, raised a similar cry, from those who tell you that he always believes the American team in high school.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four matches out of four and is not entitled to error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deligate them as the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to enjoy a potential European victory while the sun falls on the National Gulf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never show up.
On the other hand, no one is here on Sunday to help you.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the ones they do not give, and how a strategy can shift into a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this ant session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's furballs and ants.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by imposing 3-1 during the morning furballs, in the face of a disordered American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the ants and won two victories, but they have failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must necessarily pick up eight points on 12 Sundays when they are simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four affiliate points, while Molinari and he, named "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points during their first four matches.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed at the forballs, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who wandered during the two matches on Saturday, shone a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in furballs and ants, and seven matches.
Justin Rose, well resting for the morning furballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the ants, winning 2 to 1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, in a cool but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas established the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the furballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the ants, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had nothing to do with keeping its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will in no way be able to become unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the retention of sanctions strengthened his confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Organization's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea last year had taken “significant measures of goodwill”, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps progressively, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between an American President-in-Office and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea proceed first to denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposed to "the declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can cause us to rain do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was held in front of the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
Rather, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the part concerned by the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a dead end."
Despite all this, Ri's tone was radically different from last year's, when he stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump's "male" qualified Kim as a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to " utterly destroy" North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no time period had been set. "It may take two years, three years or five months; it has no importance," he said.
China and Russia argued that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the UN Security Council that: “The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made, but in the following hours, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim calls for the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and for efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight the growing machist trend of studying caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most of the students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first in the United States.
It was after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do they tell me this only in the last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The time of course consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee, curtains, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not instantly change the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of "past a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students make sleeplessness an increasing problem.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in mode of starvation, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He stated that this course had opened his eyes and had prompted him to insist that he be offered on the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the deemed establishment.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students plan an alarm for both bedtime and sleeptime, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleeping disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Menga is to bring down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new hard blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading the disarticulated team from Steven Gerrard to Livingston towards a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team was hoping to record its first move from its 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team has cast its second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving its team drifting, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to match.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 that pulled a point in the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his trained team suffocating his opponents each time.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have benefited from a penalty after the coup when Steven Lawless and he was hit, but Arbitr Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian requests.
The Rangers only took two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former guardian Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If Livi's 34th minute score opened against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped footing.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard responded in the middle of time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing appeared before Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow went next to the goal.
The Ranger replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again called for a penalty at the end of the game while he was caught up with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger counter.
The pillar of science since then, Geiger has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film " Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of atoms released in minerals by radioactivity can truly be heard."
Evans: "Say, it's safe to jump here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" and kill cancer cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient in a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract and modify one patient's immune cells into a laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "leads to an increase in various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of removing immune cells to "learn" to target cancer cells, has been demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
He wore a MAGA cap, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trump diatric after his transition to SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was on the stage after a unleashed performance during which he praised American President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to appear in the elections in 2020.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, which he sang by wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism were to concern me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, the recording of the Western diatribe has been related to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock wanted to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the backstage because of his cap.
"They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a goof," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the gulf?" and said he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him from the public at least twice, and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. One person on the spot said in the magazine: "A silence of death has fallen on the whole shelf."
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose old boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disillusioned many people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the most brave spirits: MERCI D'AVOIR TENU TESTED TO THE FULL."
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was simply "be true to himself, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours a bad ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change names and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name into a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantastic medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took it to the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to become tough to cook to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a covedette of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, admitted that he had "firmly" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have corrupted masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught to young men who become adults when it comes to the problem now?"
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What does television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they must behave this way to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There's obviously something that's wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do prologues or suites when the series would end next summer, claiming to have ended with "the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be the star of a recovery of True West, of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, Leslie's family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent of its people with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Almost 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was practically reduced to zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee of the PWG has disclosed Senators' data, and denounces "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information regarding three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extremely right" websites.
"False lies, lies, and even infamous lies" Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It seems that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown at the Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with Waters' office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false allegation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including by Ari Fleischer, the former White House press member.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the necessary temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She must not be provocative.
It must not question the reasons of the accused.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters' headquarters during the mid-term election, also reported his reflections on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the relevant laws" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English hit again. Parody by Rowan Atkinson, underwhelmed spy
It has now become a tradition to search for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this resumption of Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, incarcerated and rubber-faced eyes, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comical creation designed for a non-English cinematic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his doubtful attempts of glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in The Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the television commercials Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he wore a medieval armor and the rotor blades struck briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible compose themselves in full confidence with comedy.
Humour seems more directed towards children than toward adults and, for me, Johnny English's fanciful misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The perpetual premise of current events is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a weakly large role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is nothing much to put herself under the screen.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that Johnny English himself must be disturbed, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school master, but who secretly teaches lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice tips here, because English offers a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and found Bough, his former long-hall partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create great trouble with Her Majesty's secret services, are looking forward to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technological billionaire charismatic, which is said to be capable of solving the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of gossiped jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set the fire to a brilliant French restaurant; they create a chaos by faking on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a true anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are insured for this last sequence, but still, there's not bad things for the kids in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan for the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by providing them with an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party said in Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by it."
Alternate Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to provide details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed his determination to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiters" in public utility companies.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover the full amount of their delivery since the Labour Government could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan for the integration of workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private business capital to employees, which will cost up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed from at least one week after the FBI's investigation of the charges brought against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a briefing on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy has been more open than her colleague from South Carolina.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"By going to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Have you done this?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr.Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she appoints have not been able to verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I see nothing new that changes."
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive starboard and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people running to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers were required to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to call for action, or is it just another example of "prectiveism" - a situation where people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who argue for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executioners who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda 35 million pounds of Sterling aid to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018 to the crowd Tracey Ullman.
The group also stated that following the company's over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed in this, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary to the Interior
In order to avoid Russian energy coming into the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" use the American Navy, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the legitimate government's request - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "energy consumers' spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one string in its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to dynamising the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "unappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, the Russian energy minister Alexandre Novak said "I think we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will give serious consideration to the possibility of presenting herself to the 2020 presidential elections, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term election.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the top," she says, The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, saying he "led this country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and the candidate for the Supreme Court of the latter, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not in the opinion that it is expected to appear in 2020.
According to the survey of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Political Research Centre, 58% of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of Democrats very much to mention for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is experiencing at the moment, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers come back," she told the public at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the taboo topic" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering whether we respect what their comrades and members of the air forces and each other gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum-seekers who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy cancelled a decision issued in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is unaware of decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the friend curiae in his memory.
Counsel also argued in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants is detrimental to the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of that policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in a vacant city evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen going to their homes destroyed, collecting scrapped property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a back and shoulders fracture, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to severe persistent replications.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or to my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimacy" by means of "propaganda advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement boasting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to join the US parliamentary elections on November 6, a charge that China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to join the U.S. elections, Trump marked what the U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting state exporters like Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, written Branstad in an opinion paper published in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at Beijing's press outlet, you will find few contestative voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without even saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans turn the electricians away from the approach of the mid-mandate elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term election.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on 29 September in The Hill, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse stated "that we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute efforts made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation were enough to calm the anger of the voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28 according to Washington's newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters sang "The month of November comes!" in the corridor of the Senate while Republicans governing the Judicial Committee have chosen to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be measured," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban electors and young voters aged 18-29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing allegations of sexual assault against the appointment of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that the reaction would be life-threatening if Republicans were to advance the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the National Republican Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "it became a confusing disorder for the GOP."
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It's also the way Republicans managed the situation and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats, on the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of both parties, a small majority of them thinking on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed in Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed in Kavanaugh at all or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford testified on oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate for the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid-Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as people who are allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt was intended to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "online personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the personal data store online is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project and a community of voluntary co-ordinators.
Starting this week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee has stated that his team and they are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely camouflaged in a moment.
"We do not ask their permission."
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [d'Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a ecclesiastic of the First World War decorated with the Cross of Victoria
The only clergy of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in her hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, claimed that he was "gloriously symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploitation.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the line of fire and, with the "greater bravery", drove the line before making a campaign cannon jump to him alone and accumulating three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a 206 Bellator well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, six of which were on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face up, United Kingdom viewers were sidelined when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until the first few hours of the morning, especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the transition to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke".
Concerning the transmission, the Chief Vice-President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation states that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to shift to children's programs."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday or Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program turned off, there were many messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government question.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have wasted everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" in terms of sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling less than others because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of Lauren Laverne's first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show, he said he had talked about the issue of homosexual rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular broadcaster Kirsty Young took several months off because of her illness.
Apparently as a wreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "Now again, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a leading LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on a greater number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and so he wanted to "give hope" to others.
The world's triple champion said he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married last year Oscar's 20-year-old winner, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had the same heights and heights.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I was thinking only of winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 in the wake of brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be sitting in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him: "Dad, you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he died to finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired him with his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - which accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
America's Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back in order to avoid this unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was removed by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's furballs and ants.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-large champion shared his day between the role of supporting and skinning his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the biggest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the wrong shots.
And as if the course wasn't dubious enough in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday game, confronted Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, take a good start, the Mickelson game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He is a legendary champion and he has added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we should do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven losses, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play."
The captain of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an unforgettable advance before the simple last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danes fought his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points of advance on the Americans, but finally got up at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, pushing 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we were taking a lot of to Valderrama; we had a big advance to Brookline, where we failed, as well as to Valderrama, where we won, but fair," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 ranking win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to hell tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything you need.
It's not over before I have the points in the table.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this trophy, and that is where we have to stay focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Enjoying the performances of its players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, she's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be presented and everything else goes.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested at your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these overhauls of the last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medinah", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys like we thought we should, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple.
The new warship of Germany still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesperson, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of the Bade-Würtemberg, was postponed in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Bade-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-navigation missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the war-guardian ships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy was returning a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment into combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because Bade-Württemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship appears to be heavily overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs twice as much as the similar-class vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical amount of EUR 3.1 billion (€3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion at the outset.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Commission of the German Parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The manager stated that the situation had resulted in a time-consuming snowball effect, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement vessels had been designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Bade-Würtemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-earned brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams as well as the activities of different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of bats have declined considerably during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect perch and cause loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also represent a risk, as can the mower paper and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as the attacks of company cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats on the Thrave site in Dumfries-et-Gallow, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threeve, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what bats need to prosper."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before maintaining properties, because by destroying it without wanting a single maternity nest, 400 females and small females can be killed, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes the charges of rape while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as "false information," and stated that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then paid him $375,000 to keep his silence on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the broadcasts of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo described this information as "false information".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the fifth winner of the Golden Ballon.
"They want to get into the pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms, in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a box of night, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court, in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that these were agreed.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that pictures of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer, he joined the Italian giant Juve under a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of the car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State in charge of Trade, the United Kingdom would "sorry him forever" if she had lost her status as world leader in car construction after the Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on the possibility of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis of Toyota vehicles, has built almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to other European Union countries.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers qualify for risks to the supply chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is operated in "tend flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on call.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be border disturbances that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at her Derbyshire factory, said the company, and so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Czechs plan for future relations with the EU is "specifically calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota had not been able to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the fight for the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia, and the possible obstacles to the justice of the president.
The question of whether Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been fuelling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "want not" to send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing that Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the vote on the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's press officer Sarah Sanders made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we are pushing for a week more given all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press up to date."
The statement would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the conferences was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they break the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-and-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, said Sanders, "but if the press has the chance to question directly the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it frequently, you've seen it in the past few weeks, and that's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare for me to have a solo press conference.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Regarding fears about Brexit, the Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christion Abercrombie was undergoing an emergency surgery.
Sselon Mike Organ, Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tigers' second, Tennessee, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the State of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
"He arrived on the key line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the tap line before placing it on a sink and taking it through another exam.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there was still "no details on the type or extent of injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five placards in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 placards.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to assist homeless people under the new conservative regimes.
This will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp fee if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the extra money will help the homeless, will announce Theresa May today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by making a commitment to provide more affordable housing and target people who earn high income.
The increase in stamp rights will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
This overtax - which is added to the current stamp right, including the highest levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could reach 3%.
Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling per year.
About 13% of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents from the United Kingdom, which makes prices rise and prevents prime-accessors from taking a place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right of stamp to help more young people acquire a first house.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain real estate prices at a high level by grabbing land without using it, he invited Ms. May to give up affordable housing quotas in order to settle the "real estate damage" that is rampant in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "unfathomable".
He also wishes to give advice to the wider powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house as well as British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become far away and the poverty of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborn the North-East Club, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would come only if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's selection board are Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician said he did not hesitate to put himself behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to Premier League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself a success here only if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa to resume a relegation into third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the brink of the relegation, into a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really found that being a coach was better for me than playing.
This seems strange because I got out of it, I made a good living, and I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to deal with each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is fine for me.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my adult life."

According to one survey, the ideal time for a pint is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer cannicule caused the revenues of the British pubs to rise in difficulty, but increased the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "Permanent sunshine and the longer participation of England in the World Cup made the month of July follow the model of June, where the bars had increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered even more shock.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the restoration sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are used are by far the most popular, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that are falling.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and hotel management, said: "These results have been following the trend observed since late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors in sales on the out-of-home market.
It is no wonder that the restorative groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales by 4.8% on an average year is particularly painful, in addition to continuous cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we've known in August will give a well-deserved respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the installation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds Sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one out of five children have secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 - have secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 - open a social media account that he keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of "False Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "principal" clean account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "rape me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 have a double profile, half of the students grateful to have private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and lead this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre championships at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would seem to be if I would recover or how much.
It was a hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!

Online advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a dairy company compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is described as "the world's first silent milk pull," Elvie, a technology company in general public, has launched a bold advertisement inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milk pull offers to breastfeeding women.
In a flock of cows filled with hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I bring myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, not my breasts."
The reword continues: "Pumpose him, pump him, feed the babies, pump him, pump him, pump him, pump him, help the women with milk."
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, raised an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the "horrours" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, unless their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
The Elvie Milk Gun adapts discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's an understandable trauma for the mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a milk gun for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "So disconnected advertising."
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would've bought one if I was still on the sidelines.
Pumper gave me the feeling of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who take their milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not an advertisement that commends the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have danced with the discrete milk hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk use say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk strip is completely silent, with no threads or pipes and is quietly inserted into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother's, commented: "The Elvie Milk Gun is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable manner the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk pull made one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable. This is partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have made it difficult for children to invest in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country by bringing about a child's rescue.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of non-accompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no legal record.
"Almost 80% of respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr.Albence.
According to the refugee authorities, in order to deal more quickly with children, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case with respect to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed to be eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to the speakers and reports that have been submitted in recent months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large facility such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate a trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw on the field.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country was now in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of others have been eradicated from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were cleansed" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said about refugees, that the conditions were favorable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "promoting irrational concerns" that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel Idlib fortress has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and hoped that military measures would target the jihadists, particularly the Nusra Front fighters, who are related to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions of participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and made a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers would expect, the removal and scandal led him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At present, the public does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, high-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at great listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which has reached 3.5 million viewers during big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something that we understand," said Neal Baer, presenting the dramatic series of the "designated Survivor" ABC, who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Chapter.
Nell Scovell, a leading comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Of course, unlike everything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most successful viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when looking at a panel of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book Fear, on Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar leather jacket ("a dress full of pride" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If part of what he does seems to be seeing a reality television show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily changes in situations (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the road.
When I contacted Mr.Fleiss this week, he made 26 degrees at his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he stayed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand apart, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we had all these crazy broadcasts and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the tightest half-mandate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the electoral districts of the Congress that allowed two incumbents to dispute the same seat.
This recently restructured district of Pittsburgh is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb measures another incumbent, the republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily in control of the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district gave rise to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major sectors of party funding, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won just last March in a special popular election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China and then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to convene heads of American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, in a communiqué at the beginning of the month.
But sanctions were only provided against Salvador, which received US$ 140 million assistance in 2017, including to control narcotic drugs and provide development and economic support.
The penalties envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now needs to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats were informed.
And the three American emissaries are quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new severe messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson from Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also guide his investigation into the question of a conniving Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to render accounts before this body, when he is ready to appear before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
These are many "yes", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had kept him in mind and rejected the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the carnage years that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the ineligible walk of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to record the president in secret and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the FBI's recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is entrusted to the Supreme Court in spite of allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call for accounts from Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who once occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light weekly candles on the swastika table.
With this heritage heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confident in front of the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers will receive the fast Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury has deprived the Graham Dorrans field environment of its first participation in the season until the game null 2:2 against Villarreal, but it is convinced that the Rangers are able to draw the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game by thinking about getting something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to win it at the end, but overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have done a good job during their last game, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are having a lot of fun; training is quality.
We hope to be able to move forward now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of withdrawal
Although the participants in this survey were clearly aware of how they wanted to be treated, few people referred to the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the crossing.
Plan a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There is not only the finance involved, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place."
One man was injured several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
One man received several shots fired with a compressed air gun as he walked home from an evening.
The victim, aged about forty years, was in the Oxford Grove region in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m. TSB, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Seismisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance sheet should be postponed.
As the communications were paralyzed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Dojaga Regency, an area located north of Palu, which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Dojaka on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dojaka is a Regency that is more than 300 km (180 miles) from the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the central Sulawesi province's economy, particularly the Dojaka coastal region.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dojaka have been hit by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dojaka.
A tsunami also hit west of Dojaga in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Fire Circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, on December 26, on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, bringing 226,000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March to the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude reached southern Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of a magnitude of 7.6 shook the city of Mandala, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shook Pidie Jaya's regime in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
No tsunamis were caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have shaken the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was sued for suspicions of domestic violence, in contravention of marital violence and arrest-resistant, as reported by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held under non-secured security of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his plea was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to a prison term of up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor class B offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is under way before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His companion had claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are out of date and victims' assessments are expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people met for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack person in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York Assailant who has made eight victims - a rare sentence that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a cycling track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, failing on his pedestrian route and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the declaration of intent to apply for the capital punishment filed with the South New York District.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts of charges, including eight charges of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a careful preparation and a premedition," the prosecutors claimed, calling the method used by Saipov as "hate, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South New York District had not claimed the death penalty for 10 years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and spying for the USSR during the two years following the cold war.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial records.
According to the police, he indicated to the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been encouraged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, he specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "of course disappointed" in the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to claim the death penalty rather than to accept its plea of guilt and to condemn it to life without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
One Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the Conservative conference.
The former UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of the Theresa May suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative rear-ban MP Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "had already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary at Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faced to reconcile her heavily divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives for the idea of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to maintain his Czech compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to get out and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Euroseptics and workers to choose between its programme and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Leaves Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted "to get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already gone out," he said.
The MP of Wellingborough added: "I will defend the Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We have not given up to world wars to submit ourselves.
We wish to make our own legislation in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the release, was also present at the walk to tell journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Checks are not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who are circling the streets and making us elect first.
Leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
"Mr. Farage told the assembly that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to deceive the Brexit and we tell them today: "We will not let you get away with it."
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to put pressure on our political class that is about to betray the Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded conservative banners against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His working counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues related to the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to set up computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to give serious consideration to the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren states that she will seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed its future on Saturday at a public assembly in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critical voice with regard to President Donald Trump, is present for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The event of Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electors in a public assembly since Trump's appointment.
One participant asked whether she intended to appear in the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the death of Sims of State University of Louisiana
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by ball from basketball basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m. HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man on the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by bullet Friday morning, near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims was hit by a bullet in his head and killed by his injuries," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul said to the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot down by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge parish police service.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as from last season, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading for the world title after the team's guidelines have enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became apparent from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that Mercedes's slogans would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and froled Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the torment at the poloton's tail, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through the stands a turn later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheeled action that saw the Ferrari driver leave behind the inner part at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to target a speed arrival and to advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the booths on the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, Raikkonen ranks fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a couple," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they see the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking of the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter in detail from Ford last July describing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the gathering: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In pursuit of his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see wickedness, mischief, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their defeat of Friday in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by pulling the game back 5-3 to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
François Bouchard egalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage at the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a Kendall McFaull pass, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the set four minutes later.
During a first well-sufficient period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the service of Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer assured the Giants advance before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team met together and Bouchard again equilibrated with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory of his team by marking a fifth goal at the mid-term.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes during their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board an aircraft to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Général refused to abandon his position in the tower violently shaken at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport.
He remained on site to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sira, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to the cities of Dojaka, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the rubble and a large number could not be shaken," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have ravaged Palu that will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are caught everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused more than 550 deaths.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after the crash of an aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline that was managing the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members have safely evacuated the aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday afternoon she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local ships participated in rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the landing runway.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the aircraft's rescue exits were running.
He said the officers had panicked and screamed, and he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors working close to the improvement of a dock had also participated in rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the aircraft flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in air companies accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the records of phone calls from a cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the defendant died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he had pretended to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies lie in the fact that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Telephone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by impersonating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop once again popular.
Artists like The Fleets and Commons have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more Black?!
A New York nanny is pursuing a couple in court for firing her after a "racist" text.
A New York nanny continues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after having received an error message from the mother who complained that she was still "a Black."
The couple rejects being racist, and assimilates the prosecutions to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black on his first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOON CALLS A Black," writes Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after having understood her gaffe, "uneasy," Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice, explaining that their former born-in-law, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then returned to her by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues to sue the couple in order to obtain compensation for her return and claims a $350 per day compensation for the home service of six months for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said at the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he could not be trusted after he had done something wrong.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your new child?
Let's see!"
Likening the trial to an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very nice thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a bear who spoke, unveils a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before her publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-mother" taste after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a calm man, and he was not a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, and we did not expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain heart rate were slowing down and getting out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, in the grief of her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Bereaved women deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are trying to prevent others from getting away with life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel on a daily basis," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I constantly fear there is an effect of training."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and to whom you can talk, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you need to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had been a huge trauma to them, but they have to get out of it: "It's tearing down for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - we could perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would not "done down" in a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, or on November 6, if, as planned, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush reached out to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to leave the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of drop deserters under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South unification department, said that 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing fares claimed by passersby were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the context of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had so far been pending.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broadest sense, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed on US sanctions the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", and asserts that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and declared that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and stammered by referring to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations of "grotesque murder and coordination" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he took them in Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only incapable of sitting in the Supreme Court, but he's also unable to sit in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings on confirmation of charges, Mr. Kavanaugh raised the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women must use it.
It's a legitimate diatric, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was a framer, who told me that she too cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: "You can think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I found that brilliant."
Tears are allowed as exuberance to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage, was that I had been seized by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little terrified - who led me into a stairway.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they've got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic Parliamentary, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extra-conjugal affair on board a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she entrusted me with laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "Black White and the Seven Nains".
Since the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in fundraising, and therefore it vowed that it would not participate unless it collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they think I have the right to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration in the face of the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she felt distracted by it.
"You would have thought I was doing a nervous breakdown," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were gonna put on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit from Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China were reassuring, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
American President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion sterling), thereby charging half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in kind, recently striking customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent out of 60 billion U.S. dollars.
China has committed itself to match the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will soon be empty.
Backing Washington, it's giving in to the requirements, but publicly giving in to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing could play its role properly, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can introduce conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or another of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what observers have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, in the think-tank of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" on the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild that country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5-point bar to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, pushed his starting blow into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who has never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was separated 5 to 4 by the lowest-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than I am.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut back.
What matters is the team, and I'm glad I could help it," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the legend of the American Gulf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in career in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has picked up 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding fairies all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf during the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've given up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to go ahead.
I love those guys, and I'm proud to be the captain.
You need to lean.
We've got ourselves out of line."
Point information on the red tide : Low concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Commission on Fisheries and Florida Wildlife indicates a general decrease in concentrations of the red tide in certain areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which is causing fear of decreasing concentrations.
The red tide covers approximately 209 km (130 miles) of coastlines, from northern Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
There are islands about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in less sites than last week.
