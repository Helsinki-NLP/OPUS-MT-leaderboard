What's the matter? The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastry
The new Councillors of ČSSD in the capital are expected to have to overcome the obvious language barriers in order for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed colleagues in the SDG.
The period Aktuálně.cz "examined" the members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and politics during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm rather a novice in the policy of Prague," he said during the terminology review of "counsel" the culture councilman Lukáš Kaucký.
And as for the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted the same way.
They may know the concept of "golfwood."
"Maybe it's the only expression you've ever asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, usually in slang employment."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG polling congress, the essay chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "higher Prague golf hole", "go to the bakery", " bull's nose", "the betrayal of the capital" and "forget".
Three councillors agreed to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get involved in these things, nor do I intend to value how the democratic civics amuse themselves."
"What matters to me is how we will understand ourselves in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, Councilor Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the earlier title is an expression on an influential entrepreneur and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term that was correct in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, which immediately adds: "But I know about the news."
"I'm going to have to take a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Branka tunnel, but also the Environment Councilman Lukaš Pachý.
Then both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý really knows where to find that character; besides, they suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry."
"I think it means going to a Prague company"; it is soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but we really don't seem to have anything like it."
"Better, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we make puns with names," says the president of ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"At the school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me like that," Karel Březina confesses his own nickname.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the party's fraudulent elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of the bitches" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the “witches”, as published in a brochure
Women regarded as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be elderly, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer such otherwise."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in labor and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa Burkina Faso, deals with a special residence of over a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information brochure that should help avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a glue.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warns the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country in Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died last week, 72 years, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news came up on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "eject the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" supports people from all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is attempting to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide-ranging hunt for witches who had allegedly been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him bring shamans from neighboring Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, brought randomly chosen men and women among the Gambian peoples to the President's property in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, arrested people had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, about a thousand people were finally released from detention.
Bakala’s tenant: warms up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, aged and reciprocated, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnet" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
The three of them have just caught the liberalisation of the rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4.100 krona for a two-room apartment with second-class separate kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains a mean angry, half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which qualified the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, the man only makes a fool.
"Every one says something," he says in a bad way.
Ostrava is becoming a large testing laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year it will occur with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them is a machine to take number.
"To rent 2011", you can read in a bright button of your touch screen.
When you hit him, a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Shortly thereafter, an elderly marriage comes to ask, but the room’s crowd is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the lodgers' barrels of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window is opened at the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after briefly doubting the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old flats for miners in Bakala are the most delicate themes in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, has already treated them high and clear, and now appears continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"I didn't even get the damn bath dish changed," the man mentioned in the introduction was unburdened.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than nothing retired to see if they receive a discount on the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the rental of February the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of "liberalization" mining certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 around forty or fifty people," says the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach agreement on rental, the matter shall be settled by an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," cautions RPG on its pages.
"Here no one will be judged," one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer care center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in ways that they don't sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The regulation of rent will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the company's residential portfolio RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that upsets tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in four billion apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the roof, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square metre," indicated on the screen.
Only increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 krona per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect rents by accident, but will increase between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the increase of the rental (see graph) again on the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rent-up agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides a small nursery with all its own at such facilities: colour walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the sons of the employees of Arch.Design can visit her.
The architectonic project company Arch.Design, whose study resulted from numerous known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the building Avriopoint to include a space for its mini-guard.
The company works around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits that Arch.Designs its workers in the framework of their social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with child care.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Design's own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a total of over 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-guard for three years with its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the request for funding contributed to the company Economy Rating.
The attention of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care, and the day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day care is provided by a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education.
Since it is a "ministery", it can only accommodate at the same time a maximum of five children, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The functioning of the day-care facility is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the day-care facility, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guard programme are comparable to the regular pre-school curriculum.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach up to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among the sign companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Batlló House, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals named it "the house of the bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that reminds the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the sequence of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with oniric lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, there is a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpent and the torsion of forms continues to surprise us also inside it.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the bars, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
La Casa Batlló, located in the neighborhood of Eixample in number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the remodeling of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on overthrowing the previous building and starting from zero, but soon he accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated in the design of the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, decorations for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade emerged in their design.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Mila House and the Güell Park of Gaudí, in which other parts of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the premises shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows began to call it "the house of the woods".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation ventilators and typical fireplaces.
It may seem strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not at all respect the construction rules of the moment and did not allow himself to be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so impressed by the result it requested to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, but on the contrary: only fifteen days after the City Hall request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be communicated in this way without any problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and sloth.
The game with both colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which instead absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of the tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entering other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How the mattress and the somier are chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, mattress and somier.
First of all, they must be complementary to perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election many elements come into play, including the owner's weight, height, state of health and sex.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the central canals are not properly aired and above them are on a firm basis, they keep inside the moisture. Even wet can appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs are also influenced.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems feeling well on a lower and tougher surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For his sharp shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive bad information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in the stuffed furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have spent time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropic mark."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to be able to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your rigidity and forms depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it won't turn around like after a hard game.
Just sleep better.
Viscoelastics also works as protection against lakes.
By choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when you lay your face up, you should have your hands comfortably curly towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouník to dekorater, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture, which she teaches in specialized schools for many years.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to assemble the dreamers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with spring interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should certainly not notice the docks," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specified somier type.
The fully-accompanied bedrooms, where the mattress and the base are like sesames, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your bottom, which is often done today.
And, given that every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a life of mattress up to 25 years or even a life assurance.
However, everything has one but.
For this reason, sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully handle cleaning and washing of the bottom, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattresses are currently made with zipper closure throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in the larger models (and for one person) when raising the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm table?
Never!
So much for the beds designed to spend one night the visits.
However, it must do (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulated sheet sumers containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses can be used (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better a somier with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and its rigidity can be regulated.
Articulated sheet sumers should not be used with a spring mattress, since they do not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets so that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male" areas, began to use a softer area precisely around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for which they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are puzzles with cross-structure or boards with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also be noted that although you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "wet"), most benefits will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: pillows must hold the head and corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the lower side, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or softer area of the mattress) than the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Petroleum raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils such as castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress base, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress bottom absorbs the heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
The red pepper extract improves the circulation of blood, so that women feel more warm.
The currently favorite?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, making them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows you to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where your head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function often have lower VAT, since they are considered to be health-care.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save on mattresses and dreams.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam memory attached to the base for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the take-off astronaut loas they were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempor softens with the heat and hardens with the cold.
Therefore, the warm human body has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent lakes from occurring, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children keeps more and more people thinking about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of eyeglasses, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We're all trying to tell ourselves that it's not about spying, but about another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are placed in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In your opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they intentionally lose certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before that, parents had enormous trust in mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child has any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is being extended, it will also look for them, since their sale will no doubt be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, offenders always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, add that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides follow-up services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If damaged, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices incorporate a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the moment they are devices with a size similar to a cell box or smaller mobile phones.
So they can be lost.
According to Pilin by Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify him after a while, which can make the police take time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround all of Chechnya, but they only last for two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to catch explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of wick.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the explosives match to the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
General staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of wick per year.
According to the Army pyrotechnics calculations, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided that, in this case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempt even the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometers of wick.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the above 225.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra recently because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited on the basis of money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand that I buy such amounts of wick repeatedly."
"But it's your decision and they will certainly know why they act that way."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group's business director, Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of miles of wick, also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the wick only has a four-year lifetime and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two-year-old.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometres of wick, he obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometres," said Spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of wick of police pyrotechnics, which eliminates the Second World War ammunition or left by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always demand only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before their useful life ends.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of miles of old macha will have to be removed, which is now being purchased "scatter".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Empreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel's franchises.
The last edition won the competition "Empreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
It was noted abroad that quality accommodation was needed at a good price in Liberec.
With the savings he had with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-drenched composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"Today, the price-quality relationship of the accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income that the investments again gained in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he has managed to open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year opened another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisse, to which we sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said businessman number one last year.
"To this sale of licenses for opening hotels helped greatly to win the competition of the 'Empreneur of the Year'," says Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and around.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, he recommends to everyone that he would like to try some company participating in the contest.
But it does not need to win, but participation is already beneficial.
He claims that until now he is still living from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition I've started to collaborate routinely."
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees,
Totally about seventy.
"I've seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that got the general recognition."
"It is not, by far, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a year more peaceful than we've had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Ž★árský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's competition "Company of the Year", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury appreciated its efforts, with which it managed to turn a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but also all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight competition," says last year's winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the State proposed to Karel's father Žŏárský the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, it did not hesitate too much; it gave up its position in the company where she worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with its father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest machine press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate the collaboration with a company that had achieved a greater success in their country," says Karel Ž árský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also gained recognition for the trade results until 2008 and partly from 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, do not get rid of such a situation."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," says Karel Ž árský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unusual measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, although they were lower than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs was in research and development.
"With grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence on the international market and obtained magnificent evaluations at national fairs," says Ž árský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement hopes that it will bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ž★árský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdity survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which staff members can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the trade register, although its officials could obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a control of the taxes of the insured," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The objective of the Absurdity Survey of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in Czechia must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms part of the corporate tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and also begins to create a hobby among the general public.
While last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers needed for the tax declaration we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years now, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Chechnya is in position 74th, i.e. eight posts worse than last year.
The Absurdity competition of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-prime" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdite and www.ihned.cz.
He gains the absurdity he receives more votes.
More than one hundred were presented for this year's survey, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
Examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the tender pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the competition Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually puts the employers at risk, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocorek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in rubber water.
In 2007, what most bothered the people was the employer's obligation to communicate in advance of three days to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a job to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended secondly in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was deleted in the law of the so-called green card.
And third is due.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two scales of soil.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to dispose of a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and which support socially responsible activities," said Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel contest of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Enterprise's main competition 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, these are, for example, disabled persons, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic, for example, was the Portuguese software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports equipment among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main provider of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; therefore it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Enterprise competition of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily bought Czech manufacturers, supported Community activities in the area and respected the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities can have the least possible impact on the environment," explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The IT company manager Enlogit from the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboard; in addition, it supports work from home and its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Fellowship Person in distress, which helps in particular the local Roma community," says the company's representative Ondřej Suchý.
The Praní laundry company in čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive subsidies in a special way that affects their pension funds, is also well placed.
"We provide benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, from Bruntal Czasch's construction company, a winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest were automatically appointed for the year that answered the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the company competition responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company competition of the year."
"Individual applications for this contest are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the company's main competition for the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose advice.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives married a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by a precise interested party.
That's why I had to pay Luboš G. half a million kroner.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender," Právo told the chief prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
The way it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund answered Právo's questions saying that the police actually held the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value greater than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and the Agricultural Fund then transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to be presented to the summons and, since he was also interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those stakeholders in the field who would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that at the time of his arrest he had so much money on top.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former chief of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Later, he changed them in a very beneficial way with the judge by a house in the city's own historic center with a much higher value.
In this case, the town hall had to intervene because otherwise blocked land would prevent construction.
Families are required to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Since January households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rentals.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns a month from January onwards.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas by about 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for the supply of water and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns per year more than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as they have increased support for the production of renewable energy sources, particularly photovoltaics.
However, gas is moderately fuelled, especially when heating is most used and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are fuelled all over the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is planned mainly by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay for the central heating from January about 50 krona more per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 extra krona per year.
Residents in Prague must also bear an increase of 9 per cent of the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the pests will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns in Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase the next year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer so, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that lead to the end of medical care for young drinkers under the age of 15.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who experience such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drink beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to drink them."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," says Pravo the pediatric chief of Hořovice Hospital in the centre of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When you get a bottle of your father from the alacene, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it will lighten with juice and not smell so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesman for the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Usually, it's usually about Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use hope that they took at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikan, 13 and 14-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It began at twelve years of age, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said about this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at a dance party."
"What's interesting is that your mother didn't surprise you that your daughter was missing 48 hours," the boss was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drink by their children that is considered the main cause of the increased consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence itself.
"Alcoholic means a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," says Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson Jurinová, this year at Motol's pediatric clinic they were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunk children.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical examination, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink in the spirit, there are three seasonal heights for Pelikán: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at a time," says Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day do not suffer a terrible home hangover.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They take it much better, because after the rest of the night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose the good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients cost about tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drinking has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer at a job for young people to earn enough to pay for that night," says Pelikán.
Medical insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns treatment costs to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 planes out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device like this is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the two-way version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single space.
They are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, has already taken over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defence press department, indicates that it is not yet known when Vodochody's aircraft will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft were, on the other hand, separated from the long-recovered aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-way L-159T1 were exchanged in their current state," Právo Pejšek said.
He added that the army did not run out of two-planes, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a 200 million kroner for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 for two-seaters.
One of the new planes has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve as pilot practices in NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," Pejšek points out.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a house plane and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroners was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene an invitation to tender for purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence address states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of household planes is likely to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the latter should arrive at the Prague airport from Kbely in 14 days.
A longer index finger than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with the longest index than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously with 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger of the right hand shorter than the annulling.
They had the same odds of suffering prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men below 60 per cent, the reduction was 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer can be "showed completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechia, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday snow cover.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the quitaniev machines circulated all night throughout many areas.
In the morning road D5 was closed between the 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as did the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of Ústředního automotoklubu (UAMK).
In mile 91 a truck was unloaded, in 93 two industrial vehicles crashed, causing injuries.
Several tourists also ended up in the cuneta.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in the 185 km towards Prague.
They hit two trucks there.
Drivers must move slowly behind Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and be incorporated into the 182 km in Kývalce.
There have been several-kilometre blockades.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
For example, blockades are being formed in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams travel late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Miru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airport.
Due to snow, the Czech railway company must have cancelled seven connections for three fast.
Problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until 5 a.m.
Currently, you can already travel on most of the roads south of Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed, and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
The connections are currently closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
For the moment, it cannot be said when the circulation will be opened.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Karpaty Bílé (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region which, as it is a protected natural zone, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In Chechnya they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, further north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, they fell about 15 centimeters of snow.
The snows are gradually sent back to Czechia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the coded name XMMS-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the game progress" would make their victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise point.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it actually to function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used and, when it launches its deadly rain of metal pens, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use a "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, minus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs were relocated
Fujitsu branch moved to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu relocates its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their former office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in Niederrad neighborhood, Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, another 100 employees from the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is currently very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region yesterday brought joy to those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt Economics Section Chief Markus Frank (CDU) said that this won a "Global Player".
This is a "great recognition to the site."
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In this way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be shown cooperatives."
The building previously used by Fujitsu at the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial project building of the seaside town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that formerly used holes as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001, investment counseling and taxing companies, the Software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third-largest global IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old 20s complex, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats to Assange
The anguish is becoming more and more seized by Wikileaks.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the revelation platform from your server.
There is possibly behind political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American Senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted persons, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations reported through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service web in order to cope with high access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his server through Wikileaks, after Senator Joe Lieberman's employee had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate council for security in the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, British "Guardian" reported.
"I had hoped that Amazon would take these measures before, before previous information publications classified through Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and thoughtless process of Wikileaks puts at stake our national security and threatens life in the world," stated a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is listed on Interpol's search list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North American statements.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a councilman from the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, said on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, American President Barack Obama's spokesperson, qualified as "stupid and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the state secretary, in case she is responsible for ordering diplomats recently involved in spying tasks.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should import a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Centre against Terrorism, was appointed as an exceptional officer, announced the White House.
Therefore Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of the filtration of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done all we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The ice cream university
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream really come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The gelatier makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the making of ice cream.
The ice cream removes the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, to ensure that the ice cream on its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in mild ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art in California, loves the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
The master ice creammaker Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only its good taste, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget its formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why each ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems extremely easy.
Luciano makes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large beater, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and come out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without stealizer?
How can one give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises to dismiss the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber gua, of beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite an ice cream granite sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
They use aromas.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
Besides, there are dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"But you must try it once."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants in the course can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them draw up four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better doesn't necessarily depend on having more toffee or more fruit purer.
There is no need for hazelnut ice cream to be dried, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group develops the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
The processing of ice cream is an artifact problem: melocoton purée is used with a lot of sugar, you have to lower the sugar proportion of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool to fix the amount of sugar of the fruit types (medition of wine grower for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Elaborating ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled at a temperature below zero.
However, all automation remains out of the small folder.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his compañeros from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if it were a giant miniprime without control.
"In all the courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that passes something like that."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that is experiencing transgenic plants.
At present this issue is formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert has also been hired for years at the Ilsi association.
The consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in Efsa's genetically modified plant testing standards, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, critical Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his band.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were conducted by the General Environment Office as well as by an EU parliamentary clarifier.
However, Ephsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the assessment of the risk to biotechnology without Lobby's mandate.
In this regard, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes corn genetically modified in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If you're not looking for risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks, defendant, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the US and Europe.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind his back.
There were demonstrations
Snow.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to bring down a large portion of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart never became the same: Thousands and thousands manifested themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As he was strapped, most of the wing was made rubble.
It's broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he's forgotten the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Stuttgart's stone trail leads to a forest in Tubingen at a former French Navy munitions warehouse, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He's bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the trash," he says in his office, a wooden cottage that once was a guard house.
They insulted him and threatened him, explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the remains of the north wing to the wreckage company.
He spoke with the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained that he couldn't do anything at all for the fall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilometer cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also in the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top of it.
Stuttgart's stone of impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He climbs his whole land, makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones minced.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
White, yellow, warm, excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the woods.
It points to a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Good travertine."
Anciently the maizes belonged to the rostrum of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow transvertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were to be destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to do to the stone dealer, besides the yards, a sculptor, a sawsmith, a glass maker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potential
There's an active influx on the buffet.
16 students flock around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited a workshop to students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a sort of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and learn all about Volkswagen.
Revaluation and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: To hire students with the most talented universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities don't provide publications on their students' skills, they try to sharpen their exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, erasers and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to the illusionful young talents the practice programs and the work for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
It has advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to be announced and, above all, to obtain a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), 40,000 vacant engineering posts existed in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice on the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey in itself was only a short one."
For the hunters Dykta the notes yield results.
"Today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are near their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," said Sitha Stübe, responsible for personnel for Solarworld's solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's being very complicated to fill vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld works with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can practice with us or carry out your thesis.
There are no face-to-face advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and convenient communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55th out of 100 top employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff officer also expects extra points in his classification by his aspirants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is especially focused on the external classifications of an employer potential," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies to want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
It advises its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves," he says.
In the sector hierarchy is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassador."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get directly promotion for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby annulled its previous plans unappealably.
Also on the Atlantic coast there are new drillings closed for the time being.
This announced the interior minister, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What led to this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings on the west side of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters thus wanted to reduce US dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism lies the British Energy Consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An Obama investigation commission will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Minister of the Interior, lifted the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various Petrolerian consortia submitted applications for new attempts to perforate.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which, after being charged with charges of corruption, has fallen into disbelief, is reformed at the root.
Obama announces in parallel that the tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
Industry publicly announces that total gulf extraction will be lower thanks to stricter regulation to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO consulting company - before Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon extended to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil brown, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude spills have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on the theft, corruption and illegal trade in oil.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," reassured the environmental activist to the journalists: "Today will pass enough oil before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface they float brown oil stains.
Previously here he used to pick shrimps with fists, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions of the world.
On the road to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which sinks its hand into the water, will take out a lot of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark sticks of royalty, sadly isolate the palm trees that shock and hang their palms.
In vain they seek bird bands, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the outer barrier is closed, a sort of ghostly calm of an anterior paradise with a scent of gas liner is spread in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
War comparison takes place.
The area of the Ogoni settlement is a reborn battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke up more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
The company's return to Ogoniland is still prohibited today: While more than two million barrels of black gold were pumped daily across the delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred metres of steel platforms such as water carvings stood out: "Nativity trees" affectionately called the drilling heads.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then sends a steady stream of oil into the water.
According to the experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the ship's "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological disasters in mankind's history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists come to their heads about to break down and pipes with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards usually in the world conventional ones, reprovoked scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the fault rates of the pipes are "about a multiple larger than elsewhere".
In one place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears an oil-filled workshop under the open sky, figures from among the mangroves arise: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes linked to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, it burns a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels daily: "Give us 34,000 naira", about $22.
The delta's inhabitants take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers" who called the pipeline network that passes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this time at least 16 million liters of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in aljibs and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose way of production.
"If the oil tankers did not behave like invaders and would not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed mainly by Shell to the point where only one deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the Muscle Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special army unit takes illegal refiners, do not threaten them with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of raw materials.
"This doomed invention has completely torn our country," says Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing early in November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The defect potential has complicated effects: In a hose connection, fractures can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Among them was the Qantas-Airbus who had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed an appeal in the federal court in Sidney that made it possible to further legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the early November incident.
In the engine brand have lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will perform further safety tests for superjumbs equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for ATSB.
The security problem has become sufficiently important to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas device, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa refused the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
All-white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Ice Germany: Cold temperatures were reached in almost the whole country on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the discharges are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind cracks sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and on national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for retreading it.
There they got caught up in the night a lot of trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported significant disturbances on the streets.
In the A2, the snow and wind stopped traffic and created jams.
In Thuringia the snows affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, falling trees on the roads or broken chain and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
Firemen and rescue service attended 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, the winds with snow caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesperson at the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to one Port spokesman, there are already 40 cancelled flights.
Quitanièves are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers swept at the airport, but there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died on a collision with a train at a crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered mild injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: also here a truck was reached at a crossing because the vehicle remained trapped.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth’s journey to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after returning with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore be retreaded in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
It will no doubt continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Diosche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Deutschen Bank recently managed its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while the bankers returned to their old place of work.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of rebounding, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says, based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not appoint the reasons for the sale in project.
"We always check if property should be owned or sold and then rent them again," he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany rescinds its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper known as "Greenflowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the newly renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or an independent investor has not been revealed at the moment, the spokesperson said.
Thousands of mourning persons for miners who have died
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, corpses have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the place of misfortune, but no sign of survival was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
They have not been able to recover the bodies to date.
At present, relatives and friends remind the deceased of a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the brilliant glow of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand island of the South.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the miners buried, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under garments and surfboards.
The flags waved on average even in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the family members of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been extracted, the overwhelming temperatures from the inside of the mine will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the police's superior, the journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the borders of the genre with his epic of battles "Walla Rising".
Which audience will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of on filming "Wallalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip off his enemies the guts of his living bodies when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried by at least one or two phrases or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoying the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backyards offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for growing filmmakers and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a pity that one cannot rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and trilogy about the drug-trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he is historically unwilling to make his works for all the public with something more humorous in the main current or something less of brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and guts that sprout cannot deter most of the followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity is stuck in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Wallalla Rising" has not found a movie distributor in Germany and is only posted on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumed and bloody facade, a piece of film is hidden, sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn accounts for just a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the grim soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a young blonde, who loyally supports Unojo, keeps something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Wallalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear power organisation has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country rejects its views on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that appears to have been built by Syrians with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA International Intelligence Service of late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are constructed.
On the other hand, the technique serves only for other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
It was not long ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is hardly better known than at that time, the enigmas grew bigger over time.
The former U.S. president, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack the CIA was fully confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he had seen little evidence that there was "a nuclear weapon program in the country".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "assuming reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "appropriate".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer in a stoning manner that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unutilized military building" and raided the ground into consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
The IAEA also obtained satellite images on a member state, from commercial sellers at the moment following the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, exclusively bought them.
That is why IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always understood that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as inversibly after particle analysis.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it, just as with satellite images.
In addition, drivers are prohibited from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "proceeds progressively to become a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-level Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation against the non-proliferation treaty of atomic weapons is finally pending, under which IAEA ensures.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as an intern, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits entry into the IAEA for this reason.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has evidence that material is transferred between the three places and the cube on the edge of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither of uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium must come from and where plutonium must subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are located in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its fitness as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA inspector, associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it hardly contributes to dissipating suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing a inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also critical of this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a kind of U.S. ambassador, raises the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: For this most of the IAEA's governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought: "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her still nameless debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosniak women's associations have protested rapidly, so at the last moment they moved a few days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not a diplomat. Women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on this is sufficient for victims on the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be removed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, gave behind a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not quite clear why Jolie was not at all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, makes herself very hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents remain imprecise.
The network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "injustice and based on wrong information."
Today they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far away from here
This afternoon it's finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of distress
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy as they retumble loud music, beat the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the Sudish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this extraphalous drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, to distract himself from the fulminating question, what the future will look like.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January it will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's too far from home and I still don't have work there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from one shot he got the job of his dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin is currently working as IT advisor in Londrés.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the ESRI Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses, above all, well-trained young Irish people, for those who have so far been costing everything.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that "in Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, will go and lose our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future appear because the government is only dedicated to assembly and no longer offers future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how your peers go from unremunerated practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the subject of working abroad.
"For those starting to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to run your career," says the manager.
On your website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another one snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but with freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish fellow construction workers in Germany.
Now they raise a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago when he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs at something embarrassed and goes through frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer does not like complaints that he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working for a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells himself about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cyan Tanner likes these ideas.
Keep the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand be doing well?
But in these days there is one thing that bothers you about supermanaging: the celebration of your 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid he can degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only, not too many emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Good-bye, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime causes greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues were highlighted in the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the relatively animated mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty was only marginally increased in 2009 and has been reduced again this year to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the start of the surveys, the most polled in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent said that either they or a close relative had been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that had been reduced since 38 per cent last year and was the lowest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent versus 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to Waste
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they happened in a much worse way than foreigners feared trying to help the country go back to their problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, paperwork thrown in the canteens, destroyed polling schools and intimidation.
Election schools opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, became defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that it was "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they are, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
Displacement is expected to take place in January.
All hopes for elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if he has any, has passed to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is upsetting the country and more than a million earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the choice of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has been shown, the Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving from stitches to center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public who has increased her popularity by 20 points, up to 50 percent, the highest level she has registered since her election in 2007.
In spite of all this, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the extra income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions where one Member punched another in the face and other Members accused the bribe government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to trade unions' wage demands, are about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003, when Argentina was at the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector, and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now measure these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its staff members claim that they want to limit wage increases in the year near to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bond holders who had denied a prior forced debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped into the Paris Club, which accounts for some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which appears to be the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term of office is over, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, the support of the middle class will need to be won, much of which has grown tired of kyrchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether to repudiate or not, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Half an hour by China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What do Taiwan's opinion on her big brother across the street?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of feelings across the continent, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a short time.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party finally won three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been inclined by a total independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of all votes against 45 per cent of the KMT.
If they had been the presidents, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's proportion of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD paired with the KMT in the municipalities.
The elections saw the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with flags and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did he miss the mysterious attempt to murder rigor.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a transeunt.
Curiously, it was not possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Consequently, the KMT usually avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with regard to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste any time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to be held.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President from 2000 to 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced the plans for the establishment of an expert group that acts as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustful alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off had they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to appear to the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen's interference, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also carry out a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's evaluations have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson claims that he will restructure his office, as well as local teams.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese feel that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Discovery Artist.
He acts at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer selected personally by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the surprises of Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but it respects the rules of the Grammys according to which it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly had a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least set a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently focused on the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophoneist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and Teclist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite star in New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme", of the HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against Billy Childs' great camera jazz Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with its octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in its band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, for five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed into thirteen categories that cover orchestra albums, opera, coral and solo.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Symphony Orchestra of Nashville; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appropriately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 debuted at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated for the solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to be played in Mandolin Avi Avivital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed in the category of orchestra function by directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Named instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The Mezquita proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of order
The Temecula mosque project has received unanimous support from the local law enforcement commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it promotes terrorism and blockades.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'ais, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"They only speak very loudly."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who interceded in favour or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"United States no longer exists", read in one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Libertad dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Islamic centre construction plans have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Temecula Valley, the Imam Mahmoud Harmush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal to the municipal council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say that it is possible that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it lacks little to be a really 'alienogenic' form of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the publication Science.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder how much more is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
As Anbar pointed out, finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of alien life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows itself is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the replacement of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery did not happen by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can be difficult for different agencies."
"However, the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, to some extent, it calls biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there can naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, whether in other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found that proved to work.
The arsenic was more common in the early Earth eras, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found
The two missing dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to the sheriff's officers in Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Welsh Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found on Wednesday, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson from the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"There's an investigation going on."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make some comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show at the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukauba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to show Trace.
The other dogs were to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukauba Championship, as indicated to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour of almost two months that the couple performs participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
Usually they stay in motels and park the van right in front of your room window.
They took three other dogs (a boxer's baby, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van robbery on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally obtained green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to eliminate approximately $5 billion in debt, leading the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
The decision on Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to be relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management necessary to order its finances while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of bankrupt businesses, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial tribulations of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and no one willing to pay for the more than $2 billion that creditors were seeking.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-millionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have been collecting $375,000 per month for their company administration services, will receive a "successful fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and found an annual slate of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to make a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of your gift budget
While iPad is the leading candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant honey in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five 99-dollar BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for balanced gifts.
I recently visited three domestic toys sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known ones, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their belly is pressed.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For dance combined, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking over the technology of last year's Elmo Live, the 14-inch anatronic doll plays shift games like Simom Say, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
Children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to turn a ride into a session with an existing self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo VTech ($60, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major development of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes type system to present electronic games and books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a game of five blocks barely larger than a box of eyebrows, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to save words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-armed competition.
They are increasingly toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toys, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6-12 years old) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the online code, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include wheelchair skates or a Puffle pet toy.
A little bigger than the pig in its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microbots powered by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As an urban sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a city square, scrutinizing nervous people in charge of him, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chenguan, the corrupt policemen of the urban order of China, feared and despised by their capricious vigorous measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Stand still!"
"Watch out!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and adjusted pants to attract attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes mills.
"Personally, I think they look normal," said Mr. Tang, shamelessly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Province of Guangdong changed the grey green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidation: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a cart of snacks, and observed it with the belt constantly rustled for half an hour, until the traveling seller gathered his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women, specifically elected by their appearance, proportion and youth to its urban police.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's low respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat a transeunt after using their cell phone to film them while they broke up a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively punching offenders without causing them to bleed.
This year, a traveling salesman from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese attacking street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, regretted last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a truly meticulous cleaning."
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice asked for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a nearly governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Women Chegguan are like florists, he said, and added, "in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support this description.
But he observed that height demands were standard in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means betting, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not be present.
"We can't let a person catch or a humpback come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her aspect is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His workmate with hooves, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
Neither do they oppose their work at certain times, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply running away from sellers in the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces about a dozen street vendors who launch on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu cups as possible before being released.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his car pulled by bicycle with noodles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their men's supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, rioted after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a seller.
More than a dozen Chegguan police or officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were thrown or set on fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is only guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed loudly.
The situation stagnated for 15 minutes before the officers, face-to-face, opened up to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said with total naturality.
"Most of the time is the public that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that prosecutors of the Department of Justice have blamed Senator John Ensign for the criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure work through lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his business had national owners last year and had damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "certainly pleased" by the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "reported us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this subject."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have contrived to violate a federal criminal ban on the lobby.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
The ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before business, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees to use their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolting door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending government-investigated clients.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major reviews for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, CEO of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's principal lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against its client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claimed that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the Senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, communicated to Hampton and told him that he was "mashing" the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Alligent Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news about last year first appeared, Ensign apologized to his electors and renounced his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude his investigation.
"The Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were about a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes per minute, they sent reports of the terrifying testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty passed by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted written in court outlining the arguments of appeals that will probably occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such a generalized and immediate saturation with exaltative details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Defence Counsel of Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, handed down the demands in a judgement last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been carried by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeals courts have recognized that coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, could be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes' lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them shocking photographs of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley, and 11-year-old Michaela.
The defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he incorrectly pressed for a verdict on his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were continuously putting firewood into the emotion about the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts often felt attracted by the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civics hold a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, this week has unleashed a bit of civicism in Washington.
Is it an omen of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congress leaders did not make any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as they all say, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as an acknowledgement of their shared responsibilities to rule, instead of being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a trial period, each other being examined to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent evaluations by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or social aid, the two parties are in the opposite pole.
However, the November election has softened humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to extend unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot make believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying the unemployment benefit for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible discussion on these issues during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
"After the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will turn the situation into a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
Even though the Republican leaders are more aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they should try to fulfill their promises to cut state expenses and cancel the new health law.
These support lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cut in expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington, and, according to their own assessment, they have forced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The highest resistance is among the elected officers in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or wish for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partyism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's probably losing will change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Republicans of Congress than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A filtered American document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that directly collects the Kremlin, as reported by the US Embassy in Russia in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service were reported to operate huge blackmail systems, which helped explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it is largely responsible for corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the charges of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel demands on such charges.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, a mistress, a bother."
According to polls, the Russians think overwhelmingly that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "the ceiling" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all the bureaucracy sectors of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, said the report, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to obtain protection for MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy's note reports about men taking bags, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked at post 154 (countries are ranked at least at the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur late in the evening at Moscow time, would surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite the fact that Luzhkov may be guilty of Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, let's not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a concrete class with weakly illuminated walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemers.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as the "Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemers, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemers in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, loyalty sustained for a long time is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia Joint Court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemers, condemning the former head of the known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemers of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemers, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Red Jemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or died of hunger, illness or work excess, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that took place in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemer fighters began deserting the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Red Jemer fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemer elite officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for their weapons, the foot soldiers remained poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have obtained little benefit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to do business."
55-year-old Sister Lim, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone food."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-sustain."
The current Red Jemer Court has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to begin prosecution of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemers.
The court's mandate is to prosecute key leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the government of the Red Jemers in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers were thought to have died.
During a recent booming afternoon, Im Chaem once again worked in the fields at his house on wooden balls on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She stated that if the court called her, she would not come forward.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court pursued more suspects, even if the experts and historians questioned him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first book of text approved by the government on the Red Jemers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemers, despite the link between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But their parents reacted with scepticism when they took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with plastic bags discarded leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by a oxidized roof of leaves.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a cell vendor at the edge of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its qualified uranium reserve for arms
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treatment was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were conducted classified with Belarus in the past two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for arming of a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, which spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundred kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for armament) and the low-enrichment uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done on a plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the task, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an officer of the Energy Department working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of highly enriched uranium kilograms.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation to 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distancing.
It was stated that "while progress in these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not make any repairs to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda headed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said on a telegram.
This is reflected by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executive be informed to "be able to prove that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "unpredicted", says Aguirre on a cable.
The then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, while in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence".
On the other hand, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal element or sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed its concern at the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than at the disclassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, at lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he says.

The 30-year-old Galician started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was yours, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
It didn't take him long to get to know another boyfriend.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighbouring municipality.
With him he came to live for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to test the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her for a week in Palma.
But because of the content of the communications, it can be seen that his romance broke, which broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musked, because I have come to work."
"When I told him, he was fine, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile that he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she says.
In May, he talks about his return to his people: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to be there until 19, because 20 I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't miss it."
Make it clear that if everything goes well with him, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he must, i.e., with me, and I will never happen in life to leave him with anyone other than my mother," he said.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on 10th, is dead.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other, he's going to class almost every day."
It's about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so I save myself a little bit of kangaroo paste."
The 17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss of Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"He says Alberto sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look at how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck me."
On 30th, another one: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's ahead of me."
On the Internet there are your messages in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe MySpace, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the excarcerator."
"Terror in the thigh (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, keeper of the jury, expresses her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe everything happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Mónica joined the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday, from the judicial detention centre in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not recall how the facts happened, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested psychiatric evidence.
Populars would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the general view because, whether it is advancing or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes this training receives in these elections usually doubles the one it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan populace received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the autonomics of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a transfer of votes from the CSP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that if general elections were to be held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and the CSP would lose no less than 9 Members (has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now he has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral timetable is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal councils, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its elevation at the head of the Barcelona Deputy, one of the most budgeted administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree that the PSC may lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain a majority or a chance to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be surprising that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistorio - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in all four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can lead the return to the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by agents of the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups in Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of the last bombings in Bombay that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that the "Kampai operation" has been "weaked" the Al Qaeda falsification apparatus at the international level and therefore its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had in operation in Europe, hence that other European police units have participated in the investigations, in addition to the Thai services, so it is not ruled out that in EU territory they are carried out in the next days similar to those carried out last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones that led from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Frente".
In other words, the documents should be in the name of boys between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking detainees in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of the stolen passports in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the "command" that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and regardless of philosophical-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that she had obtained 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make herself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to be abstained in the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but at the moment, the talks that these days hold but with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereign and independentist discourses will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even wants to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated self-government and eliminating the tax of succession and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not for "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their locker would kill more than 11 elderly people
Those responsible for the management La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilma, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elderly people in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel from the center, counsel Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the responsible person" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for failing to detect on time the criminal activities of the celator, the great threat to La Caritat is now in the form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilma has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since then not stopped killing.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - which suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was sent by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, strongly denied yesterday this end and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action on the part of anyone other than the accused himself."
He was already baptized as "Angel of Death" and confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinning an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by helping out of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
The insulin stings and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her attempt to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that should clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, embraced them inside by giving them read as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not give credibility to the protests of the celator, nor even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in her visits to the court and in the low sense that it has to change its way of proceeding after it has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral differentials have been strongly closed and European banks' actions have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has hardly answered what is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is owned by a liquid market that as it collapses it recovers but is motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and tomorrow will have to be withdrawn for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the public debt purchase plan be completed ineffectively and eliminated all outstanding liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God assists us!
As at their May meeting when they stated that they had not even considered buying bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the babfuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change of market feeling after the words of Trichet.
Figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published in Ireland.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 other potentials and have up to February to obtain private capital or will remain nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
On Tuesday, however, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a centre of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December when a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Help Plan would be self-implantation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available the triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes access to sine díe markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being, it must seem so."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia asked for by his children
The time does not manage in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge it, by considering it as a "full-fledged neule", the judicial board of El Enebro of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and deal with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to yield in its dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was beheaded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantile Register.
The El Enebro judicial board for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the trown box in the family Álvarez.
The use of the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism which guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants' five children to, through procedural argument, clearly fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null board of January 18, according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board, after holding the meeting, to challenge it by considering it to be “full-fledged”.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already successfully tried to have the judge convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the profit of 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue that must be decided upon by the judge once the hearing on the demand for appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specific date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software design improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selected universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a newly arrived squadronship and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship everyone waged for the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without undermining the ability as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propells his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for far-off purposes from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design manufacturing factory assembly chains around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce, simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utilitarian cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and effect "in a few hours, almost real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the squadrons in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their equipment who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of changes in the bolids.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull bolids except the engine, which is the full responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological improvement is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most on each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolids in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The template for this task is 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is definitely the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their reputation is null.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that the advances of R & D in cart cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology is 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer since "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president Helena Herrero set as an example the remodelled shop located on the Gran Via Barcelonessa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has worked for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand selling points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install shops will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of commerce aims "to improve customer service and SMEs in buying, caring, post-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that manages to solve the possible problems of HP software in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have technical assistance services contracted," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet for 'stolen' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO Jaime Guardianola believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will try to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years a million private customers, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will have a three-year duration.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public aid, is to gain market share with the uptake of one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - their large pending subject, since so far it has spoiled more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now daring to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will this year close its master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it a further exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardianola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment," something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And although it believes that the passive war - which penalizes margins - is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already ordered his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials - see Five Days of November 22 and 27 -.
He also recognized that the trend of the bank now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that Spain "will require larger sizes."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
He asserts that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial entity enters into red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can supplant the market in raising funds to new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it remained important to what some Vatican bankers already have as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, thereby cushioning the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed a wave of mergers of savings boxes and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being implemented.
When it started the concentration process of Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which has collaborated a lot too," said the executive.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being affected "as soon as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the timeframes that in its day, not now, were marked in business plans with the Banco de España," he emphasized.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the time frame before the end of the year".
ECSC Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Slippers and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in markets have led to a double governmental response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without providing, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do we interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is again a nutshell in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is shocking to maintain the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
Secondly, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favourable flow of opinion, is close to 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments from any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has long been defined, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government lifted a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigor plans and stability in public finances), and what their European partners were doing, including France.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel was painfully extending Greece's rescue decision.
Already it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make possible the saving of a country and at the same time to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should be assisting the Union reform process that will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us that, even if we now have to take action with which he may not agree very much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro, it will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over the Spanish growth in the boom years, is simply not going to tolerate it.
The guest is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand.
It is not just a matter of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they're asking us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring about a greater calm.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have been given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite criticisms to Merkel, the the thesis that must be put at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded from less serious countries, it cannot be excluded.
So Germany will always be able to tell us that it has already warned us.
Sports and law fraud
Bullshits like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show genius but not willingness to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party disputed on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behaviour is anti-sport and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when taking away errors to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next party of the Liquilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho with two parties and various economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been played by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem assumes nobility and honor, and that it has sometimes fined its players by similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently by Mourinho, who adds a more episode to its dilated history of hystrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such conduct is not expressly prohibited by the rules of procedure contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are a crime of law; because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sport rules, but they seem to circumvent their meaning.
The issue goes on to examine the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to by the clean game is to prevent the team of the players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not fit what we normally characterized as a trap or a law fraud, because its violation of the rules was not hidden in order to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action sought to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage are obtained by the offenders in the alleged shortcomings examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not in a disadvantaged position and that the same party has no benefit, since the result of the action is obviously to leave the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club can't count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be eliminated at the first exchange, and with this action players perform a sanction party and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards takes place with less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sport spirit, from which it is part of making strategic decisions that favor the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In the present case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between intelligence and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-expulsiones and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
Celebrations self-suffrated by employees, which want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, continue.
Like the tower and the lottery, with the arrival of December they also return to the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an adjusted price offensive to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the interviewed sector coincide.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (when the Nightfall falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests on the week of 13 December, with the result up to the date of an avalanche of reservations for dinners for peak days (on 16 and 17) and just movement for the week before.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the phase of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners by budget question.
In order not to be without tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restació de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrès.
The employer's representative, today, does not dare to foretell what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants to go out but has the alerts on the subject of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to drop a step with the crisis, so that the fringe around the 25 euro has become a majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions by the night of 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a genuine boost of applications for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to what they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance reservation, even since early November.
"We have done everything impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In AN Group, which banners El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precede parties.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is much larger.
By the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure in Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "lived together", although the customers "negotiate at most".
That's right, the illusion for the parties hasn't come down, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decrease", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but are stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for developing in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-attacked territory, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The latest of the documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the growing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the Pakistani high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", says: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking anti-terrorist fighter to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it is not new, but it dates from November 20.
And it does not have to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse facing Australians in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after being authorized by the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-way news network to proceed with an arrest -- which must involve the national police force - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared with the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," she said.
As long as the world seeks him - and his mother from Australia defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silent.
Monday he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was pointed out yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as " ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should import a guy's opinion with a web page," CNN said.
Obama himself has charged a high-ranking counter-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to minimize Assange's importance contrasts with the views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or aid to them".
Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone further after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," said Fox.
Puigprecós seeks peace in the ERC with similar pipes to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the last internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party's president is aware that his resignation hiding is insufficient for his kinsmen to the exile Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can at all cause the head cracks that he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with snakes that allow him to get armored until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to speak about its continuity in secret.
By means of paperwork, and not by hand.
If the cardinals want to carry out a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified by half one more vote, but he added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good a result "to Bulgaria".
The next to Carod demand the president something more than making his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcerós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But by not having enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map here in May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document to be voted on by the National Council on 18.
His intention is to woo Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to advance the convention in the fall of 2011, something that the dome has already done.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" undermines stability and that its objective is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing the dirty rags from doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic of the article that the Functional Advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideology of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation gave the fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of those that stand out two.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once assembling as a mechanism of operation.
It therefore proposes a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsive left the leadership to review assemblyism at a specific convention for the reform of statutes.
This is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years had discouraged the handling of the matter.
Now, without critical sectors to the blind, it can be a good time to resume it and try to close it forever.

Keeps China’s objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he stated that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community on that issue.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives for reducing gas emissions, explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the state and local authorities to achieve energy saving goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries, are under way or have already been concluded.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, a provincial climate change project, one for the exchange of incandescent targets by savings and one more mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, it stated that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and planning to do so both by 2020, it abounded.
Pasted the Legality Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader stated that the former Palitan leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right to do.
National PAN leader César Nava Vázquez assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Palitan leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right is.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest taking as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, if any, to the National Council Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there was never at the negotiating table an alliance for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which he will be elected his successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Phanita leader stated that the NAP supports it for 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the county "we enjoy and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly be able to choose the best or the best leader to require National Action for the next three years, so it will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have this absolute calm and openness, to any of the five, I would be proud to hand over the office of the party's president."
He predicted that the reputation that the party recorded in the last elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next fights, although "it's not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, hopes are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations."
When questioned about PRI's criticisms to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the prisoners to reflect on the semanians of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive could make expressions like those he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there was no bite or much less censorship.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," tweeted the president of the United States on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree to pass the Dream Act is the right thing, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains a cyberlink with a broader document that calls on the public to communicate immediately with senators, since the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice hear," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority democrat of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote of debate" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the law of American Dream would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when organizations that support the project play an intense role in ensuring the approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, the supporters of the Dream Act need to add several Republicans if other Democrats decide to back up the initiative.
Among the most tainted Republicans are the Seats of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but have declared that they will not back her up on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the lake
The second round of Language pleasures was a walk where the participants made a gala of narration
"That of Sex in the Language I understand it but... what is the finger in the lake? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Language pleasures, cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the title of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the Language, he explained).
The finger on the lake... "puts us in trouble", sweetly spread the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young, who was quoted at the International Trade Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "llaga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, who does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist, she's convinced: "Patience isn't my strength, maybe it's my sore."
In the end, after a frustrating approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hall, but who explains that laga is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the laga is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the lake I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very caught up.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the lake is not named but is discovered at a time.
With brushes of magical realism, he tells of a famous spell, which also touched the clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a maid, a story that came to speak later America, the great novel that his own chroniclers did not miss from the beginning, who told Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses told by the conquerors captains.
"Servans who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he was missing to the stench."
However, he pointed out that "the madmen and the cheaters are the ones who best imagine" and it is where it converges reality and lie, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogeum.
It's actually called the "cervantinal tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what he counts."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero pointed out and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the lake.
Cuban-Purriqueña pointed at the great lake of social violence that crosses her country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and reader, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the lake of the writer's commitment."
He considered that in a fast-paced world, also in intellectual customs and control of the consciences that result in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each statement there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To be the owner of our thinking and to be the owner of reality we have to nuance: and to nuance often means to put your finger on the lake and disturb those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in white and black, established ideas and without nuance and to disturb also the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had uphills in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are also two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had uphills in his career, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting the medal of the sub-champion, has remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategy came to its first final as a coach at the 2002 Opening Tournament when it carried the reins of Morelia with which it fell overall of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clause it also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again in front of the Devils, Rubén suffered another setback, since his team ended up tied 2-2 to the choricers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty sign he was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players hiss failed since the 11 steps and suffered turning 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and can celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that the institution is most important to him.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and as a result will come the title for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the Timonel when he questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very in force has the previous end, of which, he says, he has learned much, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee closes the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two shooting penalties we were already ready to go out and I think that is a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that does not bother you, because it trusts its players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty sign, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other one and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game the fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we left, that left us something for this end that we hope does not get to that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion technician and to test for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to obtain visas
Persons should attend Visa Applicant Service Centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of 10 January 2011, it will change the procedure of processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants should go to Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take biometric information from the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer required to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for visas by traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest AUC where they will submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the AUC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

Announce NASA Extraterrestrial Life Finding
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will make known tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is an extraterrestrial life.
The findings will be presented in a press conference tomorrow at 1 p.m. tomorrow at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, described as the one responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculations of experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put the table on the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
This appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, appeared in Congress, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of bipartisanism in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, del PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, del PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins the 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, headed by the bakery Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo, said that with these reforms institutionally constitutes political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He noted that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the NAP and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be once again seized by both parties and the opposition coalition ended.
"So far it has arrived (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, said that with PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, continued, that the Congress after having been monopolies, is now "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other colleagues and companions to make them more, the convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that today the Congress became a 'bout' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're sharing it between two."
Patrón Montalvo, asked to respect the Member's personality, gave him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by doubling agreements, let 5 be left out that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, aoritis the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made them agree, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
They're going out $200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
A check more than 200,000 pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 billion pesos.
According to the municipal transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advised that more money would come from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are left to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what is due, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last "reappeared" cheques in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act states, when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after the 25th of July, Northwest published a review to the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent access to tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret foreign tourist accident due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan called on the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites in poor condition and to project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Trader Association, recalled that on several occasions they have denounced the image of fate being taken care of and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and turn around to the nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close up a company one day and have no idea what money is lost, or otherwise they don't do the works in this way in such a time and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the City Council's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so because by giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective process," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venadite of Mazatlan.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance on what tourist attractions are," he said.
"There has been no due attention given and this kind of fact shows something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that it is urgent to rescue Mazatlan's tourist sites, because they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Unfortunately Mazatlan offers many sites and historical and cultural places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to promote to fate."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A work legislature worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Partnership Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one more of the PVEM, has been installed, which is a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of new members of the State Congress is that they come to conduct a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly released 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa due to the various challenges he faces.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival groups of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
So he talked about certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to take over the Governing Body in turn.
"We took care that they came to do a decent job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the signoans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with less budget and is inconsistent as important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with agro industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to assist in providing security to the state and updating the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A Magician King Is Seeking
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a key.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and the clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house of Colony Salvador Allende and lives up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Well, sometimes we see each other hard because my husband doesn't have chandah, but we sell mandarin and papa... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'we're going to see son', because he was very expensive', he recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years of age, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family can participate in the campaign You are looking for a Mago King, donating a toy or cash at the reception in Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a decade of persecution has been carried out within the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various accusations.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where the production of drugs was carried out.
"About 750 Cannabis plants have been seized, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
Detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of Cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place following a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
In this operation, approximately seventy officers were involved in the investigation module of Estrie de la Seguridad de Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department.
You can fight clandestine migration without problems
The Conservative bill, which the Government believed should address the problem of women mothers loaded with illegal migrants, would surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite you weigh," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals defend that the bill in its current form, which would allow the arrest of any person from a ship identified as the transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures should be taken against the officers of the clandestine fathers, and that is what we want with another bill, the C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," Mrs. Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country as a falpudo."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote to be held so that each Member who would oppose it would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Research since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has surprised more than one.
It can be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the joke" and as "a last-minute chapucera solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," it simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more he obsessed Mr Charest to avoid the creation of this investigation commission, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, suggest Quebec to give a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a collusion and corruption survey.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrille is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this subject.
During the spring 2001 operation related to the pilot groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being monitored closely because of the severe rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have evacuated from their homes.
At night, there was another stream of land in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road was sunk.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions experienced severe rainfall, between 40 and 70 mm of rain.
Also, additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfalls add up to the snow thaw that had already accumulated in certain sectors, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec's civilian security unit issued warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, strong rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overrun of certain lakes has caused the closure of several routes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growths of several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partially blaming Dupont
Quebec's Radio Presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reversal to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as their crude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI team 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rough language which should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable and not misleading data.
With regard to suicide, present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be viewed as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any blame has been disposed of in this regard.
The last dispute concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort had been involved in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rough language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, inter alia, announce decisions once in the hours of major hearing within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Algerian watchmaker Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, from 23 to 30 October.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shu World Cup in China."
"They will invite sportsmen who have finished among the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, finished in eighth place."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this point, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw the adversaries to the ground.
The confrontations are originally held on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain a competition in his career, he will no doubt come to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the nice boy.
"It is like the equivalent of the Lampinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand) " .
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a true professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium composed of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management one, amounting to 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy management, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and to cause a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said the Quebec Party Member Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how it could benefit the public in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there had been a collision with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in "dishonest" and "without rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be that the PQ would apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Usually, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
Moreover, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devour published last week, the consortiums' formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register allows to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIM+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau has emphasized that "the territory of the James Bay responds to a dynamic of particular labour and Hydro-Québec has specifically responded to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to an invitation to tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account his participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Administration contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has concluded that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it happen that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before it needs to be more of their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer is hardly relying on sustainable development actors, fair trade marks and eco-certificates to guide their elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe through which they propel messages that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even impedes its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that bring products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "corresponsible", points out the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the doubtful nature of the information make 46% of consumers discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed yields of the ecological products or services that they are being sold.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent has given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food grown in their region, reports the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the rate of responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consummaus de Quebec loves to occupy the position of the recycling king who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (of its car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behaviour survey, which has just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycles and walking trips.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has requested that it commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex post the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which expected a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to re-purchase Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true vocation to the cinematographic center, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to take part in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would actually be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million last spring, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, referred a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a last report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any event, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried the burden of authoring cinema in its premises for ten years after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyal to his clientele.
Angus and the Parallel company, led by Christian Yaccarini, are also pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not again made contact with Le Devour and we do not know what he and his group of the proposals have received.
Canada's veil is lifted to accompaniment...
New American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to Americans, but both reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-US relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government to get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have become public yesterday offer more juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of almost inherent inferiority to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems with understanding this "distorting silence" because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
" Logically, you think, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His journey will help to ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will for the first time fail in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series broadcast in the U.S. CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that during his first bilateral encounter, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that he depended on "each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that spirits have been warmed up in connection with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee is echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in a quantity that corresponds to almost one third of the additional decrease to be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in the set of major concrete projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by light bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that had to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, still 5 Gt of this quantity should be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the two-degree temperature increase to prevent it from being out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED light bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those released by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they contain nothing of mercury.
Several experts have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact light bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact bulbs, but the coal thermal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is poured down with the incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars per year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is looking forward to the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the interim results immediately," said a spokesperson for the UN head.
"Ask all Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the interim results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without publication of the results, three days since Sunday's polling.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests have been multiplied in the world that the IEC finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side has been cancelled by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, has said that the intimidation maneuvers of the voters carried out by the FNs in the north of the country had discouraged the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted Gbagbo ' s complaints.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the "unacceptable" delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations has warned the political class of Côte d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the interim seasonal variations (CVE) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the working population in continental territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, are available within two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in unemployment to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
There has been only a stability of unemployment between 25 and 49 years of age, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, covert, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, as his lawyer points out.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and answer all the questions posed by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all your client has done is take care of the landfills he has to handle.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their implementation, he knows nothing about it, as counsel Simon says.
As part of this file, it is also being investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Aubagne urban agglomeration, due to misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been blamed on him."
"The instructor magistrate has taken the explanations into account and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night in Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "removal and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social property".
Among those who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Giard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to whiten the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research notes that the research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", has vilified the public in France, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held in force in Iran.
"Haced noise," they say, "sold continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "inocence", "immediate liberation".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have been exhausted, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "expert in dilating maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, on the day that he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (EUR 230.000).
He also notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison after twelve days, but she's stuck in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition calls for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes Iranian clandestine networks to acquire material for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's excarceration is a bad news.
Have you accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guaranteed that it was not.
The Elisha, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision," he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The Councilman of Elisha marks a telephone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, Elisha does not spare any effort, uses communiqués and "refugees" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media "blitz" of French officials."
To what is such "gratitude" due to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their laudable statements, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to set up this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been stained with premature and reckless".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows it from good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we have thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a statement, thank the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played an "active role in the liberation of our country."
From midnight onwards, Korean youths can't play online
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "Cenicicent" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study in school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial officer responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, precisely.
The government also proposes to ask companies to limit their daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, added the manager.
In addition, it will make available to those who request free software to limit internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates Thursday the World Cup organizer countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where the influence struggles and lobbying can become dominant over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Qatar Emir, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions between backstages, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the football crib, which only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fire on Monday by spreading a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the English officials, who have been thrown into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the coup given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the JJ.O.O. in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to regain the brightness of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to its already ready stadiums, its experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can is to give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're getting their dirty rags off, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had experience in 1994, seemed the most logical favorites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the World 2026 concession to China, strongly desired by FIFA, would cause Asia to run out of chances by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has submitted its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: proof
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had come to understand that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had neither the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
The current Head of State will therefore be re-appealed in 2012.
However, the evidence does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, you always have to appear to doubt.
Go one side and the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends stated that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP Members, on Tuesday night at Elisha's, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some commotion.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
He was simply transmitting the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time she talks about the presidents, with a playful tone, in encounters of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think what will come next."
His earlier statements do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
They get comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone to the lecture which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he immediately and prudently responded to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You will always think you can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for the crisis exit or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the crisis in the sovereign European debt, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will certainly not be allowed to be so perennial if it does not want to risk worsening a more complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis of the European States.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, by increasing, for example, its State bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve of Brussels, during its hearing with the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed no more eloquent about his intentions, stating only that the State Letter Buying Programme on the secondary market "continued" and that "we shall see what we have decided" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main unchangeable rate in 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week to some EUR 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday it would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists do not foresee any significant change in their course either.
Although loans operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to modify your program considerably."
"If not, it would risk causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Comerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," he anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations so that the market remains stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile States," said an important bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are set in the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing their indebtedness, or even in stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government covers the time
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the decline of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
On the way out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unbreakable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had been shot up to 263 points, causing a certain riot in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, manifested himself "deeply concerned" by "turbulence in the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Indeed, its problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have provided a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent planned by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary arrangements can be applied after the parties, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be taken", says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of his economy are in order and his accounts are in good condition, as we have said for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Paduan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a period would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and by day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and their monetary area."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of the European States has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than the pace of markets".
Aware of this hiatus and its hidden dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for the exit of the existing crisis.
Informal consultations among finance ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
This also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market striker (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it is no doubt that it prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first EAFRD securities issues will be carried out next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
With regard to the countries on the front lines, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both of them want to avoid at all costs asking for international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European Funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently equipped with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could certainly examine European capital in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 orange alert departments
Snows continue to cause difficulties in movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already on the orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to mid-day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, strong snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snowed slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, from 7 to 10 cm, in the affected departments, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
Snows are strong enough to cause difficulties in circulation and affect some economic activities, alert to Metéo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it be not conducted except in case of need and that certain TER vehicles have been banned during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation has been prohibited in Picardia.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture " Urges all drivers to drive with greater caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport in Roissy and 10% in Orly due to planned snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the French island has reached its high point, it will take billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4,000 million.
At the theoretical level, this amount will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain market loans to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, which was discussed in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax in France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the bill's text, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is an amendment of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"Tax resources must be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment that income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million are not included in the credit, can lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Hackers revengers and diligent spies
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that just seems to be scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm that each file created by a secret service (irrespective of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The norm that secret files should only be made up of public knowledge news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for new things about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust in what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the chief of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), which only considers certain what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the US embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as the newsweek published last week.
Why, then, have such a revolt caused the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly well, we just seem to know that we don't know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker could consult the most powerful secrets of the country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both victims and "verdugues".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In ancient times, in Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has come true since, being able to control each movement thanks to the phone, each transaction performed, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a full victim of the power eye.
But when it is demonstrated, as now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the revenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets be sustained?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has not harmed Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put on the grid any information reserved, since it would be like publishing it on a road sign.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential telephone conversations cannot be expected.
Nothing is easier than discovering whether and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain in the future private and confidential relations?
I know perfectly well that for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and, therefore, new, but I imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the spying attempt of the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communications, the Internet has re-created a cable telegraph (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and going back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow to advance or back from chapter to chapter, that is, to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, with the displacements it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing other than normal that communication policies and techniques bring us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being planned in secret at the embassies.
It is currently the embassies who ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's hats in its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unblocked funding promises (called fast start or early start) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to provide EUR 7.2 billion in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and was appreciated for what was really worth: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without damaging official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has made reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million in three years of fast start funding is added.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro lent is equivalent to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to reducing emissions based on more effective technologies), it is false to present a euro that is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As a matter of fact, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respect" its commitment of EUR 420 million making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document to see it through its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union which uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union makes a euro to meet its commitment, France only gives ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast-start funding, France does double-use: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue to donate when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The early financing chapter is a short-term, short-term detail in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other European Union countries.
But, in particular, France could move forward the discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We therefore hope for the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast-starting and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning on child-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old boy eats on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are an illustration of the problem treated," acquired food from Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September that usually consumes a child about ten years of age in four meals and a daily snack.
These foods taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as the golosins, were examined in the laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although almost all of the cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association points out.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a tentempie for the school, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green Jews in Kenya, included in the food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, can tuna and even the bread bar or chicle were fitted with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon shoot was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "polluterine cocktails" for the consumer "probably is underestimated," says the study.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
