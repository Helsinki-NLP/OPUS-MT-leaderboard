UN Chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted for almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council divided to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries in the Council - Russia, China, England and France - on the margins of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 figures from polls showing that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drop Donald Trump at the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump is driving with a two-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to ask seriously what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was taking place in polls to Herman Cain, but none of them won in any state in the nominating race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But overseas groups such as Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the Conservative Club for Growth group admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just passing through:
Figures indicating Trump's support have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are maintained.
A survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for nomination.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasm" or "thank you" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "sorry" if Trump would win the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say it would be "enthusiasm" compared to 40% that says the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "disgruntled" or "sad" if their favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.
We find the same figures in Iowa State, where 52% of Republicans still believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the necessary personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents claim that his temperament does not have what he is looking for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take intellectual attitudes, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed against the end of July, when four out of 10 bets on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, the GOP voters have not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate, Trump is still at the head of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will be divided to more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-by-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that over half of Trump's voters say they don't change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this regard and no one can say that these will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to change their option.
However, Trump's biggest opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgeon, but it's twice as likely as voters who say they've decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump named immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central subject in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a breakdown between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also upset about Washington authorities.
A survey carried out two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in the Congres, 54% declaring themselves "disgruntled" and 21% "nervous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut later at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be analysed closely by the media and Labour MPs.
During the weekly apparitions, he asked for “less theater and more facts.”
He also said he could give up a few participations and give them up to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech he held at the annual TUC Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Party leader to keep silent at the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "contained silence in a respectful manner" and recognized "the heroism of British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the BBC's Two's Newsnight show that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's lead team, arguing by differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the policy differences “cumulate” in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn's appointment regarding his position with regard to the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Leader to confront David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North stated that PMQs involves a level of confrontation too high and will refrain from repeating and attacking, engaging in instead focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the opportunity to speak, saying that he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated often with PMQs, but he admitted a few years later that he did not succeed.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, of the way it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics claim it becomes a caricature and requires profound reform.
« Framework in Joburg»: Young people without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage enlargement
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a minimum wage increase in Britain could mean "a higher purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is rather praiseworthy and not critical, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unpleasantly into the spotlight by the scandalous flight Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a quadrant match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have landed Kyrgios, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place individually, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
“One thing that I feel powerful is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a missile when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of that.
But to be serious, it's been extremely successful in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man who works hard and has joined the team, had no kind of conflict with the other players, he is very respected at the dressing room, he is trained hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important remission game, which begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long-term team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he grew up in public eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, good for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders has been halved in national surveys
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is on second place, 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who hasn't announced yet if he's running for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
In the face of the CBS news survey last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage between women and moderators, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront of the old voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has an easy advantage of five points in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say they would eagerly support Clinton if she chose to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it's the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may be surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely to be excited about her choice.
Opinions are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority response is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible candidacy for the presidency, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him running - although a third of them think they should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general elections, but the figures dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is located at a distance of two, but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well with regard to some key features of their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustworthy and having strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen among all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and trust, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not think about him in this respect.
Democratic voters generally also consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as them.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
How the lingering questions regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of the Americans are unhappy now with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided on this issue in March shortly after the issue came out.
Most Americans say that this email-related controversy has not affected them overall about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they've changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be an integral and reliable one, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at general level: only 32% consider it integrity and trust, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not regard Trump as fully trusted and trusted.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush ranked the first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrity is greater than those who do not feel the same, but, as in Carson's case, many do not.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternal accused of killing the student in the year 1 of the Faculty of Baruch
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a Pocono Mountain initiation ritual in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Congregation of the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to his eyes, put behind him a 14-pound bag full of sand and was suddenly repeated while trying to move towards a target on an frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches and then lost consciousness.
The Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call the emergency number after he passed out and pretended he'd waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the frat at national level, to ask for advice, the chief of police, Chris Wagner, told a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide personal goods and put the good of the brother before Michael Deng’s good, ” Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, trunks, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life each year because of rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be responsible and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with the murder of grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be accused of outrage and complicity at murder.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Faculty of Baruch prohibited the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve increases interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will grow, bond profitability will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In the economy, history offers few clues to time frame..
After the first increase in interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when they start to increase interest rates but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, in the game there are multiple variables.
In the end, however, market players could find that all the excitement related to the increase in interest rate has been overstated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the “cheap money” era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it can't be said that there will be no effect.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipation of the increase in interest rate can evaluate things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the reversal of monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed growth.
In fact, over the past 35 years, the market has increased sharply - with approximately 14 percent - towards interest rate growth, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (averagely 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategy of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits start to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but the increase in interest rate often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a growth decision every year from Fed, all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the WTO could approve an increase in interest rate at this meeting, time-term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our post- 1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsing peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile considering that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first cycle growth/decrease occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of the bonds is immediately declining," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds by flattening the curve.
High cost-effectiveness obligations are better achieved in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decrease of the estimated inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the return on profitability is higher, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed asserts policy.
In large lines, companies that carry out their majority activity in the United States will have to win as a result of increased interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Large-debt multinationals will have to suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to their products being spent in the area of the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in interest rate," Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital gains as well as low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have earned from increasing the dollar.
Those who save might also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham
Conservative Parliamentary Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station because it "scatters"
It claims to be increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, claiming that they plagiarized the Britts prizes
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither is this show original.
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentary officer, putting pressure on the job to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative Parliamentary Andrew Bingham also sent the BBC chiefs that the public radio station "scatters" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
"I feel like Radio 3 "stupid" - although I don't like to use the word - but I feel like it's turning into Classic FM," he said.
It also caught the eyes of BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Britts under another name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent with regard to live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about classical music that I know from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that he needed to make more efforts to attract audiences to the previous period because the British had less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticised during the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee because it would go after its commercial rivals.
Conservative Parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's talent show purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be realized "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a chicken with gold eggs in its own grade" the next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to prohibit future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or spend money on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The latest month has seen the slowest growth from 2000 to the present.
Online sales took place three years ago due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the November Black Friday could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned British commercial streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending in August showed the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the growth level of the previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a trend of time rationalization," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, for Guardian.
He explained that online sales came forward three years ago when buyers started using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (increasing).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event taking place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers squeezed in front of computers to put their hand on the offers, which led to the collapse of several retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that when buyers beat their chilipires, they might be reluctant to buy them.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 out of every 5 pounds is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothing and shoes online than to use fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the sanctioning of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the collapse of the macaral in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Minister of Health said a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of the crane
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane crashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, the mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a building crane collapsed through the mosque's ceiling, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also fought 394 wounded.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the upper jaw when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group partially bears the blame for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but it said that the company’s leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the macaral to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and the Group representatives could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Great Moschee of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has been closely associated with Saudi Arabia's royal family and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated son", demonized by family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred under strong wind and rain conditions, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every fit Muslim physically.
Authorities say 158 people stay in the hospital.
The authorities decided that relatives of deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and that the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of loans into Swiss francs
Two conversion offers have already appeared on the banking market in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest can lead to increasing rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just completed the process on the conversion of credit into the Volksbank francs, and Bancpost has announced the offer of conversion for its customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer of conversion of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of clients with credits in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk commissions and customer-paid administration, then an additional reduction of 22.5% on the lei balance was applied.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to how monthly they were equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5%, and the Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the collection of credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from the future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the wage is settled.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property reassessment is not made, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing company.
Also, both banks offer a discount at the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formed more of the interest, and the client pays very little of the main.
The very small-interested bank offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It's not known how this interest will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that ROBOR indices will grow significantly in the following years (more than Libor - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may also occur, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to increase interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a reuters survey involving 80 economists, little by half last week thought that the decision would be taken, I think now that the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, recovery bringing billions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who's lost his charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also reported that the actor would have faced the issue of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this certainly has a cost.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is standing at the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on his right foot in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of the Eindhoven PSV.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke up the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then he'll be operated on Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, faces difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double break the rest is six months and it won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty hit.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's wrong and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, starting my way back to recovery, I will come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeating PSV
The foundation of the team of England has another reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad accident.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never want to hurt an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious accident, it's not right," said Cocu.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see but the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is like, I know how difficult it is to go through such a thing.
I feel so bad. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked the omission of England but still stands firm
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repetition of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate the choice of a winning move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but it has good players on spins in the batting line and collective morals is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a tender positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England's team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test games against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of question related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - players are their own selections.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runnings for Yorkshire he'll have some other opportunities.
The main coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not within his capacity and did not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman gets noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs -- like Sam Robson before him -- while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that missed occasion was past.
Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricket player who has "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up to the fight alongside Cook, which would lead extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hit there and this left player has already shown that it's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number three for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test 38 games as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on team on back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his old age - with an average of 31 in the fight and 35 in the ball - and they might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selections have opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the coach team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for test matches could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the tournament's white-ball league and will bring both energy and unquenchable ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes is resting for one day's matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, trainers and selectors do not do the program.
And you have to hold, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy.
Camp Brexit could have earned cause if the economy remained in calm until 2017
As the day passes, David Cameron's renegotiator strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more confused, even without the election of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past few days that - plunged into crises similar to that of the EU - not all of them being caused internally - some Member States are fed by the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that neither do they want this if it erodes social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor take part in bilateral meetings or sessions in foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wishes a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that many ministers and officials from certain capitals have come to the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious German Chancellor, is an ally but he has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave his position before her situation crumbles, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English people who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they don't want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "The Great Britain has not obtained any value from renegotiations".
Europeans know on their skin how catchers Fleet Street can be and how skeptic are the barons of the oligarchic press that regard the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
Perhaps they remember the vagueness of Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-payers, foreigners who cheated telephone and pseudo non-domestics who hold most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them kind of the same way but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me back on Monday at Westminster - I told her not to spend any more time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from Neil Kinnock's strategy of boycotting egg in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but it must develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at BBC left her on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution indulgence.
It says that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with conservative "english" could agree with that.
This said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher fought not to recognize that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as Minister "in shadow" on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s when his father fought on TV to be unfair to fellow laborers, without going too far and without losing his job in the office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to transmit - hold it, it also sensitized me - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the rotation of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favor ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good support for the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbien's basic sophism about EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his sophistication about NATO - Tom Watson is mindless about the fact that JC will not campaign for abandonment - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be wasted political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
Officials in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, a few researchers questioned the robustness of data and pointed their finger at the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary base of fragility" that PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in BMJ questioned their claims and based them “on solid land or on moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claimed that it is expected that PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a model of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco in the past for the conduct of an independent study.
It also validated the BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the funding about which there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
There were no arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but among them are a number of known "fronts" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting also participated the head of the PHE Tobacco Control Section.
The research work carried out by the group "convincingly explores" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have in accordance with most criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is so far no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health department, said that he had responded in the past to the claims of the BMJ.
He said: "Electronic scissors are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is lower than that, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and those that does not show evidence, given in particular the high degree of public confusion about the dangers relative to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs borne by the national health system due to smoking amount to £2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - that is, while the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

Advertising that shames Great Britain's arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Firing to crush the ankles!
Dispersed Bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The cheery voice and animated images do not doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade is a heavy charade, made by Amnesty International to stress the desire of British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and subways requiring a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London subway, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, many arms dealers will be asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are carried out by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group named Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using “Ad Space Hack Packs”, a 6-pound package of Allen keys that says “facilitates access to about one-third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet.”
The London Transport Directorate is not amused by this vandalism in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists increasingly ask questions and seek to make political work accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.

The film by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the arms trade advertisement - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement but "enriching him with strong animations and colors, he was more
"They did a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the trade," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not marketed illegally and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms trade comes from the inside of ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic products of euphemistics.
In a press release, Saab issued an order received from the U.S. Army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder support launcher."
This includes “a unique-shaped focus that offers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight rules of gold to live in the home

Violent David Grimal: There were no world tournaments at the time of Bach.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the greatest artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as an initiator of a less ordinary project, entitled "weird", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of talented international soloists and musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was at the Enescu Festival this year with two performances: a performance, Sunday, on which the soloist was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and a month, when the violinist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu were ignored.
Both shows, performed on the Athens scene, showed the public another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the musical scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical set in which there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for the musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists, or to become an interpreter in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are formed as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the music fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, business, the music industry, he does marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on one side qualified workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but we have to watch, which is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells that this change in the way he makes the music came from the "musical disappointments" of his solist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So I haven't found any point in continuing on this road.
So I decided to create the Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one was doing this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you do marketing with a group of musicians where there is no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Disonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians in the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the whole, the absence of a conductor did not prove to be a stumbling block in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the easier it seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not just in the role", supports Grimal, adding as to the Sunday show "we were 74 directors on stage".
In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" one, just because it invited Les Dissons: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the largest orchestras in the world singing and three times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group."
Within a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist recognized as feeling the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal militates for changing the way classical music education is made, considering that "the music profession, as it is organized today, has an ice of death" and that "the future of music represents itself".
We don't need to do the world tour five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, release of albums, all are amazing, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity is suffering, there's no more freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and good meat."
To enter the EU you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come to the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his teaching in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell by-products of music," says Grimal.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's completely different.
After your appearance, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes from the passing of this status of "soldier", the passing of what "you think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert there are smiles".
David Grimal talked about his project or music and his vision of music and artist at the "Ideal Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
David Grimal's Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the School of Political Science in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his course of life.

Along with his solo artist career, David Grimal had to explore and more personal projects.
The freedom that he offered to collaborate with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
In addition to Les Dissonances, he established "L'Other Season", a series of concerts given to the benefit and together with people without shelter at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.

Les Dissonances also climbed on the stage on Monday, this time with violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Small Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: double the two characters in the superproduction "Crayaa Zăpezia 3D"
You have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who likes the movies?
Give him a chance to get a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, they wanted to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Small Voices Mari", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classical drawings the focus was placed on approaching the voice of the actor's specific animated character, in the last period, when creating the story is also taken into account those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we start an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and get parents to sign up for our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the replicas are funny.
"The kids will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11th and September 30th, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection that will be selected 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the small vocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to register the child at the contest and prepare it for the voice test.
Afterwards, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register by playing his own double version.
Four films about friendship, fairy tales, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the evidence: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mone: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D laying" and "Maya 3D albinuța".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Creiasa Zăpezii 3D", which will be premiered in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx winnings are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 decrease
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for all year as a result of the low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell sound.
FedEx Corp. said it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decrease is due to the rise in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher rates for the land transport of large or large packages, which will apply since November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase earnings compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director General Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular with regard to global production and trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intended to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The gains per share were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit increased by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in the online shopping went against the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, income from the ground division increased by 29% but operational revenues stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic rates, while revenues from the free division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday closing had dropped by 11% at year level and by 17% compared to the record maximum recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most expected meetings in recent years, policymakers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a wall painting of the United States will be shown.
The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double charge from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the US and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be discussed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent global financial market turmoil could frighten Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Certainly, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co brokerage firm.
"But I believe that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait again," he said.
There is no consensus on the decision that Fed will make, it itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg’s recently questioned economists anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that the growth probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease on the stock market if Fed increased interest rate, except where policy makers would mitigate the promise that it would pass much time to the next growth.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry averaged 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by the expectations that the Fed decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if Fed increased interest rate at this time,” Lonski said.
If Fed's decision-makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty related to the moment Fed would act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowing down the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that there was an increase in interest rate this year in spite of liberal objections as more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to not meet the annual target of the central bank, Fed decision makers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling suddenly.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets have begun to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China has devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial media dropped by 16% below the record record peak reached in May, as investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy will bring world growth down.
The market somehow withdrew this month, the Dow index being now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate increase.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and almost no data to be based on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of Fed's major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
However, in reality, Fed became the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
A simple allusion to the President since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "close" its monetary expansion has triggered an earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly started, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the overall strategy department of the Investnet Inc. welfare management firm.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia caused Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identification potential for U.S. development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to those declines.
Fed should raise the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the case of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, Adam S. Posen, who was a member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The last hectic period does not rise at that level by far, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get in the situation to fear an increase in interest rate because the markets are upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this direction, I do not believe that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to broadcast in Today's Show about changing party leadership
The urgent shift of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the hearing for Today.
The morning show of the Nine channel transmitted from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Army, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over a few weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Cascada Niagara and Cancun.
This "crossroad" of the distance did not seem to matter too much to viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having a audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today there was a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series as the protagonist of the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, subject to a widowed father recently, who decides to move along with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night answered resoundingly that “yes”.
The X-factor show transmitted by Seven was maintained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking the easy face of The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded couches and descents the second night he transmitted The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe had on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) went up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday evening, the first half hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of Chase Australia's hearing the second evening will provide silent confidence to the Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun arrest at an airport in Siberia.
Because he opened up President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets at the protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the new proposed constitution of the country, one official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of Kathmandu.
According to statements by Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas after firing fires before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, about which it is known that they can kill but are usually used as less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The crash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent collisions triggered on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, the country governed at the central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was initiated in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, cops and weapons
The Prime Minister shall continue the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position against the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated view.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It's a shame for 21st-century Europe to apply 30th-century methods," Victor Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday."

A wide front of low pressure at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands presents a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center in the United States said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined front of low pressure about half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still premature to tell if diabetics with mild obesity live more after weight loss surgery than those who follow necro-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to lower the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Throughout the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5-24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data tight after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in manchon - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatment against diabetes has remained close to the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes has been completely cured at only 1% and partly at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, concluded the authors.
Researchers have also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers say that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean level of haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved "glycaemic control" - reflected by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the gastrectomy group in manson, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with high weight from Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% lower death after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit for patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 procedural interests.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it claims that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to put an end to the violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also pointed out that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must at the same time think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he said.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US violent response has generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without appealing to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergents in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Virus Centre, U.S. anti-Virus Centres reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed hand detergents with high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Virus Centre, cases of ingestion of the hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-Virus Centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"The children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez said for CNN.
Lopez said that some kids drink intentionally detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies showing teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts him," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (of hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with strawberry aroma, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the Anti-Virus Centre at Kansas University Hospital for Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents of their hands in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume too much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry flavoured hands, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah balgaje and couldn't go when he arrived to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain injuries, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet products or napkins and no longer leave the detergent to the children's hands.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they swallowed hand detergents containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students from northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by putting antibacterial products into class," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be “insignificant” and addressed the disciplinary issue of the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There are no disagreements at Celtic
Griffiths breaks the rumors about Celtic's misunderstanding, Deila admitting that Hoops are not in the best time but they will return.
Hearts faced with SFA concerning Neilson and Warburton's charges is cautious about the January purchases that affected the team's unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic to five points
The punishment of ADAM Rooney in the first retaliation brought Aberdeen's people a narrow victory in front of Hamilton's in Pittodria, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors about misunderstandings
There were rumors about disagreements at Celtic, broken by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to confront the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
Absence of Scots in the title race bore the Dutch - by Boer
Former middle-class Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title of Rangers.
De Boer, now ambassador to the Ajax, said: “In Holland the summaries of Celtic matches are no longer transmitted; why?"
Because it's not Rangers there.
Here, you're not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about Old Firm.
It's talking about both teams together and that's where the interest is going.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
Ronny Deila accepted that Celtic is fighting out of power, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen that played in 10 people, now at the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: "Celtic had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
So do we - but we need to move on.
We necessarily need the support of Celtics because thus the players get better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Warburton's prudence on January Transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that some targets for January transfers would be identified, the chief of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibox unit.
The former head of Brentford said: "The transfer period of January is very different from that of summer."
In the case of the transferred summer players, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could see in this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you get worse if you bring in players that aren't necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the end of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with problems at the ankle and failed to leave Wales in summer.
Hearts confronted with SFA about Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was taken for granted after he admitted that he sang a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, at a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding, "I don't need to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly management
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United Council still trust that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "the dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the team in Aberdeen must desperately cling to Hamilton Acies in order to achieve the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the first shot of the punishment executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won such games."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain increases
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in the period May-July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom total rose by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom of 5.5%, according to figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over three months, with the number of employees currently employed by 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure over the United Kingdom average of 73.5.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy. ”
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, I have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, employment rates increasing and unemployment rates falling.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the State Penitentiary's execution hall Oklahoma and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches because, I'm terrified of the idea.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists can be witnesses to execution in America and, because usually requests exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places reserved for the press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to notice what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, get access.
I cried to her.
He acknowledged that "it could have formulated better," but it is still his view that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if he asked me.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list any time.
However, he wishes to be present an international report writing on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that I have made.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man who likes to die useless.
Peter Moody claims the Stewars tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody said that the Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy to his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewarzi and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are carrying out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Daddy from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about spy statements and didn't want to look like "the fox that doesn't get to the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly collapses," Moody said.
It's known it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying to give them everything that's best.
As soon as they start to think that's not the case, I have to quit the coaching job.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview given for racing.com where she said the integrity department tried to spy on her stables.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I will say if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then you should all resign because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know and today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to begin to have a spine and can lead to the responsibility of people outside the trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So stupid is my influence on industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might cause them to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on it and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
Frustration of the trainer increased with the long investigation into cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved and the removal caused him to say that he could “put his license on the table”.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, has labeled the rules of the day of the race as "ridiculate" after applying a cataplasm with nemol or clay to the feet of the horses, which violates the rules.
It's breaking the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put them on foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the day-to-day treatment of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewarzi have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but they have gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a bicycle produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the accident site.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being badly injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man handed himself over to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing the scene of the accident, not offering the first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the opponents' charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the plating tactics used by his team as "denominated subjects" brought to the discussion of the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "take them to the road" team in the game that Storm won in the final qualification last Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called that game a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's hacking tactics and said the players simply focused on the "contact" when they board.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we've really put the focus on contact in plating and so we've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We're funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarrra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship by playing "plicist" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion comparing his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he wasn't interested in anything black under his fingernail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be exciting football, especially due to the fast-paced middle boys.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two middles like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a stronger score-related match compared to the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't I seen him yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more trials, which means exciting game?
Or does it mean to pause and not mark?
It's plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the screenings next Saturday, at AAMI Park, placing tickets for sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After the arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worry” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before "assuming he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: “He said it was an addiction - that it is dependent to scare people.
He admitted he did search on the computer but said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent the images to him and about the fact that he asked that person to send them other photos.
He said he did it to engage.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: "Then when the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried and cried and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, domiciled on Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges that he made or took indecent photos of child subjects, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the appearance of 24 March of the current year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender register because it can be said that this crime “has not involved a significant sexual aspect”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was transferred to the sex offenders' register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, transmitted the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, it was not hurt to film the fall became viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said that they would have received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to mislead Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they took him away during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called "death," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity no longer has value.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availability
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 availabilitys as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide the stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer division and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services that are growing lightning.
The expected availability will cost about $2.7 billion from quarter four, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, President and Director General HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP today and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business run style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing non-responsive integrated solutions" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is broken down, which is the subject of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called the "Silicon Valley strike".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The HP measure, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: Comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, campaign against unhappy life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wishing to raise the question of culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy disposition”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces to half the probability of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money does not even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it directed attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable photollies and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that men can be associated with this situation, even though they often avoid exploring their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me: ..."my role in listening to people who tend to commit suicide and depressed showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, the people calling us don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to manage yourself is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer several long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention through the telephone, people reached in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you are attending this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete play of filming dishes to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the League of Champions and helped PSG to meet in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
Next we present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the League of Champions groups, with a peaceful victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their profit with the goal marked by Cavani in the minute 61.
Getting to Group A with Real Madrid and Şahtior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only the qualification in optimals but also an improvement of the course towards the final quarter in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of the goal after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where his career was started in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or move to the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next class, even if there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 retreat obtained from Bordeaux in League 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in minute four.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the middle Argentine offensive was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he slammed at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before he knocked incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right portion.
But if someone expected PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who won Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine national teams, with a defense of five and two half-defensives, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's whip that passed from Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
On the other hand, PSG players slowed down a few times, giving a few unnecessary and unending steps, even Ibrahimovic who missed not less than five attempts only in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, caring for him as the one Di Maria sent in a diverted from Wiland over the gate in minute 52.
The second goal was recorded in a final after an hour of the game, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This gap eliminated Malmo's hope that they will rebalance Wiland's score and only a superb stop from the distance for David Luiz's rejection maintained the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi's new entry cancels him an empty extension.
The Norwegian coach of the team in Malmo, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "The last game I played in the League of Champions was last December."
Since then, I have played only in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, struck by falling stock prices on the commodity market, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of an extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is trafficked with falling prices on the commodity stock market, as China's economic activity decrease influences demand and causes market disaster.
The preferential right of subscription increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock market in the transactions of Wednesday morning.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of broader plans to cover almost a third of his debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of Tuesday.
He took out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the increase in the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation has led to substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other goods have decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists that the economy expand more globally
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group in charge of reforming that the economy must open wider to the outside world in order to feed growth.
"China must commit itself to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said, during the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reform (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouraging state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganise the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing wider market openness.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers delegated to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
China will also, according to the declaration, allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open the state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of companies set up from foreign investment and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of lawyers' right of practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli took part in the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not grateful for the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education have not reached any results, the government proposing a 10% salary increase from 1 December with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or a 20% increase in December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister, Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister, Rovana Plumb.
Today's government proposal did not please us, otherwise we would not have come in the situation to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that we were promised today is less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Bridge: In the future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI which will also be attended by the representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal for wage increase, following that trade unions decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the unionists that the government is trying to send the Payroll Act as soon as possible to Parliament so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
The regulatory act provides for the increase of salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase foreseen in the document to be balanced over the next four years.

At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after the ship they were in wrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, inform AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed to the Greek island of Kos.

The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it wrecked.

Over 100 stewardeses fired because they were too fat
The Air India Air Company fires about 130 stewarzi and stewardese for being overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made on the basis of the government's recent security and regulations, but critics say that the measure is "ridicola" and "sorry of sexist", says The Washington Post.
Mass firing is the most recent of a ten-year battle between the company and the most crowded stewardess.
Weight limit for them dates from the '80s, when Air India began to use graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardess considered "extraordinary overweight", since this fact "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
Stewards sued, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," explains a company spokesman.

I understand Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If we wish to formalize through a decision of Congress, we will also do this.
There won't be any emotion about it.

Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the national.
Then I thought I was sorry, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed it and he also ideas.
But I wanted to go.
If he wanted to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros a year, we were about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.

When he saw his wife's films with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself, "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'That was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Besides, his wife, who, although he doubted himself for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's head on his mind was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a three-fold alcoholiness over the legal limit, although one night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and investigations without numbers, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare illness, "Auto-brewery syndrome".

The government approved, Wednesday, "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "an additional step in Romania's efforts to modernise the immigration management process on national territory", according to a press release.
The mentioned source shows that the strategy aims to manage the effective phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect European-level policies adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the States of the immediate vicinity of Romania, steps are being taken to manage the unity and consistency of situations determined by the possible influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migrationists or which can affect national security," adds the mentioned source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out a few general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: the promotion of legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the seat of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania of third-country nationals who respond to the needs of occupation of the workforce, promoting access of third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for areas and professions identified as deficit.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means of establishing concrete activities that will lead to the creation of a flexible system for the cessation of the growing migration phenomenon".

T.V.R. Management Activity Report, rejected in Commissions: Stelian Tanase risk resignation
The Committees of Culture of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Governing Council of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted against the rejection (Mr. Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next full meeting will be discussed.
"I believe that considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the president of the Senate Cultural Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that he was "good sense" as the TVR management was present at this meeting, under the conditions that at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions there was no representative of the TVR management.
It was good to be present for the TVR because no one here has been subjected to any personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members earlier last night, about an hour that we didn't know yet, but today, after the meeting of the assembled bureaus, I personally faxed a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think that when you're summoned, you're budgeted, paid by public taxes, and you're summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you don't like them alive.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution in Parliament's sub-order," Severin said after the meeting of the committees assembled by Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we also saw as they went on, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay off the historical ones.
"I'll remind you that it's not my fault or anyone else in these committees who's lost that pleasure with the banks and with the tax, they're clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the meeting plenary, elections will be followed for a new board of directors, and he will elect the Director General of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't happen.
It is important to make political decisions so that this institution will function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand by the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, full of Parliament, by their vote will choose the people who will drive the TVR with great reason.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you need to have - good sense in the attitude of the employees because it's a bunch of little kids coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you receive such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," concluded the president of the Senate Cultural Commission.
Although it was not presented to Parliament, the President-General of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, asking that Parliament should have a number of measures which could lead to the saving and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexing of the TV fee, the amendment and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the tax for public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions on the level of technological changes to date, as well as for the regulation of the procedure for controlling the payment of TV tax and finding the contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wishes to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv representatives for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum limit of 5% of the commission of the cashier.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of VAT quota for public television and CNC-specific activities from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of the Law 41/1994, in order to obtain budgetary/financial allocations for the acquisition of licences for major cultural and sports events - World Championship of Football, Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months, considering that the employer's labour law obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not definitive, and pay entitlements are given priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenses with staff and TV production.
"That way the travels and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," the letter of President TVR.
Tense appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be corrected solely by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the State institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out its public mission", mentioned in the letter.
The conduct of the House of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

Moreover, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this capacity and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, under the conditions in which he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Elie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make any more politics.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the "Burnt" movie, the actor made a breakthrough that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook."
He devalued that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he went on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man who would make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you," he said, but what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
When he was 40 years old, the actor admitted to being seen in the near future as a director, taking up the model of Clint Eastwood, who took over the whole of the board at this age.
Bridge, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the claims of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning according to which Hungarian political decisions are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fled".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, insulted the entire Hungarian government," transmitted Hungarian Foreign Minister in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost total support in Romania's internal policy," he added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a post on Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his view, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis," said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the adopter of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, recognizing that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma chirmata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are policy-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - which we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these objectives and values!" stressed the head of the Roman executive.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta as "simply lies" regarding the management of the refugee crisis by Hungary, recognizing that those claims were inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extreme and lying remarks" of the Roman Prime Minister of the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against the xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are the craps of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how our Hungarian neighbours treat them, with their lipstick and insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to begin preparations in the field to expand to the border with Romania of the fence that it builds at the border with Serbia, to make a possible change of the route used by migrants.
Later on, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to raise a fence at the border solves nothing of the refugee problem and "Hungary Scots of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the macaral at Mecca?
Saudi authorities announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday, on the Mecca Moschee Sea, an accident following 107 people died.
According to an investigative committee, the company did not "respect the safety rules", reported the Saudi press agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by former terrorist leader's brother Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at the expansion of the Grand Mosque, to be able to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by the strong gusts of wind, collapsed on the east side of the Great Moscow roof of Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How did the Hagi lock up the challengers' mouths?
Considered by many worlds the greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled, after the withdrawal of activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team that he owns.
After a year after the team took over, the King demonstrated that he was able to turn a team that was struggling to save from retrogradation into a top.
Thus, after one year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remixes and 11 breakers.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, fighting at the European Cups.
Things took a better and better tournament for the Future this season, as the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future has also the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal with Astra), more than double than Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought to the team several experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team came up names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy in the future made a follow-up team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Alongside the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to the Trade Register data.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played until now as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt to as well and adapt to them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are at a very emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area need to change: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and was not adapted for the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said he had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in JHA and any state may block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure in which the EC has the initiative applies, and the Council approves it by a vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have emerged even in Germany against the policy of opening up Chancellor Merkel and they didn't want many countries to look like a reaction by the "EU" sending migrants on our heads.
Therefore, the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably be witnessing major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just let to get angry again?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to which the migrants are responsible for the state in which he first enters, because he is not sustainable.
If Greece capitulates, you can't say forever that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve a solution without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism to impart the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how binding quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there is still a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will start taking over migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
There will probably be some single filtration centers in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications are processed.
He's working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are strong without any experience, as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenophob.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% of them have left, winter is hard to go from the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so disastrously in the media.
You were talking hard with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Magrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than in other migration waves, but that doesn't mean it doesn't integrate at all.
There is still an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
Let's create the fortress of Europe is illusory.
We must go to integration mechanisms in European societies.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn their language, to try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including by convenience couples.
However, the imminent problem of these people from the long-term problem of their integration must be separated.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we should look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean it's going to make the country over the night and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see forts within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls are reintroduced into Schengen.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranged the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where they set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean we're running around, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave it can't be like this, because some countries don't make the face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France we do not have much more dramatic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that's in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think the Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
There's gonna be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and was not adapted for the situation now.
Romania how did it play so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks if he pulls the bag over his eyes and blinds his ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will fall very much.
President Johnnis says it's probably good that I haven't already come in.
So we move from despair to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
Of course there is a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will join the Schengen so that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we're not going into Schengen anymore, but we're more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen and Schengen will exist, but transformed into a common responsibility for the external borders, there will be unique rules for the acceptance of migrants, one rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, one rules for the countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being great power means mistaking Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before the principal or opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years was a battle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates a focus on instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to get bids, press the buttons to fix the situation.
Offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve things in one way or another created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users have become used to the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, inform New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will look rather like a nuance of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone postulates on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give Dislike.
The network users, who reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as refugee crises, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like that post," said Facebook representative.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted on this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of mass incomes at its southern border with Serbia, announced Government Counsellor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also joined Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The new seat of the Judicial Council is falling.
Two manufacturers, insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are expected to deteriorate because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the county council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up giving up on its own.
One-and-a-half years since the building's consolidation and recasting work had to be completed, the work did not reach half.
A final stage in the epice era of the building was completed last days, when the National Council for the Settlement of Challenges (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the technical project for the work to be carried out.
The original project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the termination of the works, negotiations procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm was to update the technical project and then to organise a new auction for the works.
"The negotiations did not end through a contract, however, and the CJ appreciates that the proposed form would be detrimental to the institution," said Răzvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to discontinue direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be considered finding another designer.
Thus, building building consolidation could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, re-establishment of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation work of the former headquarters of Police Management began in 2011.
A first job contract was terminated in April 2012, after work of 4.5 million lei was carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being assisted by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out in proportion to about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, recasting and handling of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief of Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record of the Cadastru Office signed a reconnaissance agreement against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A councilman from the Office of Real Estate Registration and Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a corruption file recognized his tele fap.
The Agreement on the Recognition of the Facts signed by Dumitru Dcelu was registered yesterday at the Iași Court, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dcelu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in the fence with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts attributed to Dscelu, the prosecutors stated that he, as a councillor of the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, "made a false number of verbatim acceptance processes, sold the service delivery contracts previously sealed by the O.C.P.I. together with the SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Data Agency and Topographies SRL and PFA Lipșa Stefan, which testified, in a non-real way, that the services contracted were performed in total, under conditions where they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I.I. Iasi".
The past days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but other former or current employees of the OCCI were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Pre-trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's handball national to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday in a meeting with the press that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that, it must go through two stages of forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants high-level coach, doctor, two masons, gate coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get some qualifications, exactly material for physical training, which we've never heard of.
These are all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything you take from me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we're in the stone age with the preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said that he is trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and to the possibility that our country should host a major handball competition.
We don't have room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, entire Olympic neighborhoods have been built over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a dump of garbage, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same was true in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success and investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people gave his agreement in principle, but they quickly resolved that the room would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concrete.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," said the official FRH.
The former great handballist has avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to arrive in Final Four: "I have asked all trainers to be reserved in predictions, that if they do not come back against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all components of the Romanian lot are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We are ready."
Both my colleagues and I are with the engines at the top shift.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the occurrence of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor," Macové told.
The selection of the Romanian national team Lynn Howells, who was first experienced as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of being selected by rugby: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me it's an extraordinary experience.
For me it's very important that every game I make the Romanians be proud of the national team.
President of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish sportsmen success and I believe we will be at the beginning of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at the age of 18-19, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends who set themselves to realize a dream," Dumitraş said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France, on September 23 in London; with Ireland, on September 27 in London; with Canada, on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy, on October 11 in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, on the Twickenham stadium in London, with the match England - Fiji from group A.

14 million lei give to the "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Iasi to the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "Sf. Spiridon" hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and preparation of clinics, but also in medical equipment and techniques for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six ATI beds equipped with appropriate ophthalmogenic microscope and other equipment necessary to perform the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and planning work of the "Mare du Ars".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will receive work from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure decent transportation of the sick in the UPU in neighboring clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tătarași, which will organize it in the ambulatory, in the same way as it currently works.
The clinic will operate in the area of allergology, hematology and endocrinology in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
The jacket, laughed at by RATP controllers and a folder.
The country of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to press again in your city.
Unwanted, they hit the wrong information from the foldrs, the distortion of RAPT controllers and, bonus, a "law" fine.
The wives arrived in Iasi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist packages.
They also got a brochure that passed the RATP routes.
"Arranged" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iaşul.
But two days ago, you found out in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't a ticket to the station next to Copou Park, they relied on printed information on the brochure: that they can take ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusting in the fold, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the fold.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there was no service for two years and it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where would I know what was written in the local press, I came one night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is call us one fine instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visit day stand at the Jandarmerie and give statements there!", Ovidiu relates.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the incorrect information on the brochure and the controllers who "implyed the law to blood".
It's not right, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the point is that I felt wrong.
Constipation for the rapists of Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preventive arrest
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal Iasi.
The Jesuit magistrates judged the first term of judgment at a non-public meeting in which the seven youths accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Prior to the actual commencement of the trial, one of the outgoing judges whose file had been distributed, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues in the court.
The Magistrate activated until the summer of this year at Vaslui Court, where he was the President of the Section On Nale, who, on 9 April, admitted a complaint made by four of the defendants, willing to place them in detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete one of which are members of the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu magistrates.
Previously, in the file he formulated an abstention and Judge Dan An Ton, because his daughter was in a relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists would continue to be in preventive detention.
Your nerves will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when the Jews will redeploy the possibility of their release.
The next sentence will be held at the Iasi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Iași Court of Appeal, the van with which rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the area of Paccurari, the car entering the Iaşi on the belt.
Iveco's autoutility with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagen car that had come out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van's circulating from the end of the Settlements.
The car entered Iasi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on the Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arresters called for another transport to take over the prisoners.
In a short time, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Iasi Maximum Security Prison, which took over the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the wheels, and the arrests went out at speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the U.S. cars understood to be amicable about the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin Tăranu of the IPJ.
Great migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize are, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinary.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasited by interlops and paralyzed by a political venal class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The failure to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of all colors have not been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to provide decent medical assistance, to collect street mess, to create honorable paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what causes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the warlike activism of strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearless hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid of stealing from someone national.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for their departure, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be mocked.
The causes must be eliminated, some people support and, by strictly calling for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, something foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country each year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, broken-down and overrun construction.
I was concerned that Romania was not able to invent a country project, but that the EU did not have any future plans.
And improvisations and threats don't help at all.
Then, what is the EU doing, if the only advantage that Romanians enjoy - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders as through cheese?
At some point, the Syrian war will end.
Not the migrants' crisis, however.
Over the next few decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is neither and will never be prepared for what will follow.

Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was taking a treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were taken urgently to the "Saint Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a bold gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital under dark conditions, in the black of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a beautiful and blonde girl, met again the other day in Iasi with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iași, to get to know her past.
"The day of Iasi", who witnessed the search for the original family after some very vague clues, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
Reporting reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are indeed moving and overwhelming.
Krina's story starts 20 years ago in the exit town Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
At home there were disagreements between parents, and my mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've never known anything.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were going to break up forever.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After imprisonment, Crina's father went to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I would have thought she was abandoned," told a niece of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iași, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one has ever been interested in the fate of the child all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave her to care for the Buchium Placement Center.
They were years when abandonment and adoption were lighter than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Savior and his wife, a couple in Palermo who wanted to have their baby but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of blonde Crina, and after a while this would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our daughter.
"As my wife would have given her life," he tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he catches in his palm the girl's fiery hand.
In the country, Crena's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their searches separately, each where he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he received no answer where his child could be.
The police then passed on to him that he might have died, but his parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for her have never been.
We prayed to God to be well.
I've been thinking about it all these years that've been, but there were no possibilities for us to walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crinai's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents from Romania," she confesses delighted Crina.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romique Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counsellor Iasi, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crinai.
And the search just started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I just got a name, the Coastal Balkans, then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the mayor there, and I could ask if there was a local name.
Then they gave me some clues, just that the person found wasn't the one wanted.
"It finally took about a month before we found the girl's biological father," explained Commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, more than three months they took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had home in another town.
We started the moves somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we established a first meeting in September," added Romica Ichim.
On the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica first saw the girl lost in the hospital halls of Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could hardly control his tears, and his hands were still shaking.
He barely exchanged a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting he couldn't even sleep.
He was still nervous, shaking.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a niece, who comes with Costica from Ruginosa.
The meeting of Krina with mother and biological brother
In the discussions with his girl, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among others, that if he wants to ever return to him, in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to collect a household.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly believes that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," she tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Krina's mother, while holding a napkin in her hand.
In him hide his tears, of happiness, because soon he will see her face after such bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will fulfill in just a few days, this month, 20 years, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she drew a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iasi
In the Union Market, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginosa reunites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I don't share borders or countries anymore, but just a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of the Iash, have easily passed.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if it gets another chance, they will do it again.
It's the first event this way organized, such an emotional load, and I'm glad to be a success.
We at the Center have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with people who are drug-dependent.
But we're trying to redeploy some good companies back.
"If I'll be asked again for such an event, I'll do it with great pleasure," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Iași Anti-Drug Counsellor.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, departs from the story.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns on your foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul.
The camps of the PSD’s outgoing subsidiary have concluded an armistice with a gun on their feet.
Following successive rounds of discussions, carried from Friday to Sunday, the first being even more tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Press the executive president of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social democrats will send him an entire list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Apart from having ended, the internal war of the party seems to have taken only one break to allow fighters to draw their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
At the October elections, the PSD county branch’s Chair’s function is expected to be fiercely competitive.
On the short list of potential candidates in the main function of the party's outgoing branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Councillor Vasile Cantea and Acting President of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of the town of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
One variant taken into account is also the candidacy of PSD's head of county council, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer be in the race, sources within the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nikita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on election day candidates can be filed, and would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"It's important that we stay united, and we will stay after 3 October, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Judicial Office and all new driving structures," said Quanta.
Until the internal elections are organised, the management of the county branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nikita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until 29 September, the preparation of the elections will be carried out by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It reached a partial consensus to support a uniting team to deal with the county.
"However, on the other hand, there are several variants about the intentions related to the application to the Iasi PSD presidency, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
An outgoing judge refused the files of the rapists in Vaslui on the grounds of co-coupling
The seven young people in Vasulua County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iași Court of Appeal.
Vasluiens sentenced to punishment between five years and eight months and eight months will present their arguments on their release today, after the Court of First Instance, Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest penalty in this file.
How the Judges Have Caused the Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge of Vaslui's court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In reason, the judge speaks of the indictees' challenging reaction, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The court finds that, after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the local and national community level as regards the fact that persons charged with serious acts are judged to a lesser extent restrictive," the reason for Judge Vaslui.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "door church".
"The Court points out that the moral quality of the injured person is of no relevance, an aspect which the accused wanted to highlight by the defences they have formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states in reason.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's Future
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday probably few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder how much it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war workers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (at one point Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, asked him to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (was also invited regularly to comment on political events by the "Russia Today" television channel), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States' favourite.
According to the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the type he was telling and promising and Tsipras in Greece until he gave birth to the real world and economic ties.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader includes, inter alia, massive renationalisations and printing of money as a solution for financing projects for development and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money-printing solution is not unanimously adopted worldwide, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who else could prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge bankers with blood, become some kind of left service enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in former Communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at one point the money of others ends."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s, another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as strongly convinced as the party's fresh leader, failed sadly in the elections.
And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the whole of the labour force, and extensive automations have resulted in a massive need for highly qualified labour force in the industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly.
In its final financial Times, Corbyn's choice is increasing Brexit's chances, and the rise of Great Britain in the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and look at the crisis of refugees shaking from EU foundations, you get to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which would take place until 2017, to leave the Union symbolic capital loss for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it of the Euro crisis and now of refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for scenarios of the most worrying.
As much as for a whole number of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (where however Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
True, the British business environment, the City, are powerful lawyers of remaining the country in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments that grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have had a very recent show in Jean Clude Junker's speech, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens in conditions where electoral support for anti-systemal, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where also the conclusion that Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the Euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of the interest and the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is feeding its populist rhetoric on the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity that has enjoyed over the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-Immigration zone, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken into account inclusive political ambitions, and not the ability and availability of Europe's peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the EU's internal tensions will increase in intensity and can further affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brunches: "Take and open the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his reputation is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "tude."
What do you write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the notes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brancuși produces and delivers money to almost 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
Furthermore, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with edrasla, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to the Brâncuși."
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Not even the communists were able to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His cities spread the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and share.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
Seen from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Brancuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that, if you didn't have the chance to be born in any big city and in any family as bright, your chances of success in life are almost null.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where we should start the following text.
With a sentence, however hateful they are.
Look at the success stories of idiots, which are delivered to you every day in newspapers and television.
Watch this man's face carefully.
You want to know how he managed to make it alive, how, today, did he hear a whole mapamond?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Peșșani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
It is Marie's fifth child and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of which would collect his posters that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places he grew up in, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Peter Túțea, from Paris, from 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For thousands of years, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
Civilization of the great city has reached us.
Brâncuși's childhood, however, was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the birthplace.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the tap was made "at the boiler", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, Brâncuși caught a moment of general neglect.
He fills his palms with walnuts and drinks on unsweetened.
It falls into sleep almost instantly.
First people only notice after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then hysteria, believing her son died.
By the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by wrestlers, he sees far away the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul in their mouth.
The party immediately turns into tears.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandosa, dophtoroes and tanners' servants.
The cheese checks the child's breath, then puts it under the horse's bloated nose, gathered around.
The child sneezes strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep his drink further, of joy, the party with the wrestlers continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine collect and bring them.
The father stabs his child with his head down and, with the nuts brought by the boy, beats him to keep in mind.
And while he feels the heat of the hits, the little Brancuși reveals that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around him can turn up.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, unless the star himself participates in his disorder.
Have the sun been as troubled as his father as what had happened to him?.
At the current time, the city is not working
A Parliamentary appeals to politicians to remind themselves of those who voted against them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient its agenda to the electorate.
What we are now seeing on our political scene is a great disbandment and so on.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects since 2012 going on.
Neither highway, nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see just how politicians argue about their possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's just leave politics a little further, get together and talk.
At the present time, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blăjut said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the outgoing electorate, the consequence being to be a very reduced presence at the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The honourable Member also believes that voters will continue to focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the "For Iași" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on active civic people, who are usually on the right.
"It crumbles even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blăjut.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidacy for future local elections, dismissing the rumors about his intention to enroll in the City Hall race.
