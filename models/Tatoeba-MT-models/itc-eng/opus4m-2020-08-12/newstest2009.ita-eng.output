The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transaction of the CEZ shares has reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downhill is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
So, too, there is a reaction from the market to the result of the vote by the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Breakdown of shares in Asia
On Tuesday the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges have experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day, subsequently wiped out some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also some of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses occurred at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets all over the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy alone, therefore without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries too will have consequences.
Strage of American Actions
The American Parliament rejected the financial system support plan on Monday, for which 700 billion dollars (nearly twelve billion Czech kroner) had to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday have suffered a blow and the main indices of the actions have recorded the biggest collapse for more than a twenty years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a collapse of similar dimensions occurred last time in 1987.
The index was lowered before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the draft law was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has yielded: the US government can extend 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will be at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion kroner).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, must define some details of the understanding before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday told Reuters agency, chairman of Barney Frank's Bank and Financial Services Committee.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening financial markets.
But then we will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, we will reach market aid.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Democratic Nancy Pelosi said to Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislature delegates met last night between Saturday and Sunday with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-cashable mortgages from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the conclusion of the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan again, but I think we are," Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday as a result of the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations will be able to stop at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But the Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum if it feels that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, however, Congress may overrule its right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the programme has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've prepared everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with the positive progress of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of gold parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the main spokesperson, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold paratroopers to the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have made a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relies on the help of the owners of the homes who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates which it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly interest rates for debtors and allowing it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial for how the losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Most important, it is that already this week the representatives of the Congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," said Marek.
Last blood duel: MP3 vs. mobile readers
We'll advise how to choose
While almost every mobile can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is best to buy only the phone.
In spite of this, there are many reasons why we should look for an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the owner will use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you could hardly buy a expensive high-quality turntable to listen to us on Maxim Turbulenc's last album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, on your shelves, you've got hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, probably a turntable like that at least you dream of.
It also works with portable music, that is compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are the categories of prices and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8 thousand crowns, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd perhaps difficult to digest the caps from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Alongside the primary functions, call and texting, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe also can navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your mobile phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the battery charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic cell phones are concerned, they may last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get you to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours of continuous functionality with a charging.
Another problem occurs when you download music into your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly music can be recorded directly on memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapters for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library ordered by the name of the interpreters, name of the album, gender or by the user's rating.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are particularly interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music in particular as a background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram there is only one cell phone that reads MP3.
This can now be done, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what your mobile phone or reader is looking for.
MP3 readers support them all, the overall majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and usually is limited only to the hit of the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM , internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone wants to hear something in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always carry the headphones or at least the wireless headphones.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best phones and from a technical point of view more equipped and even with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really do anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant data transfer ticket.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, covered by the 2 000 kroner.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player too, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service as it approaches the same MP3 player.
In this area it has made more way Sony Ericsson, which walkman cell phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 readers of the above-mentioned brands provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 krones, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in a maximum range of up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing – a virtual operator that requires traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive operators in Europe has already written many times on Mobil.cz.
After all, it has also confirmed ČTÚ, which has noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and cover highly over 100 %.
Instead mobile telephony operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) is also often emphasized by Pavel Dvořák, who in the past expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network may no longer have many possibilities. (Moreover, it may be difficult to find other frequencies.)
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant price fall, to which traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices were resounding in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year this operator managed to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among the other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more concrete group-trap.
In order to actually function, it is sufficient for many less customers than for a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, i.e., relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that costs at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-strike not recently.
This operator aims to say so specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
The press spokesperson for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will never be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will happen rather in the other countries in our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are not definitely very much in favour of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything because no potential competitor is created.
For a while it has not hidden its interest in the start of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first, it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe there'll be better times.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a virtual operator in full capacity.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press section of Telefónnika O2.
The specificity of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
The press spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the declaration O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and advantageous commercial projects for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered at the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates its attention rather than reaching its 3G licence requests.
Adds Miroslav Čepický: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of spending and infrastructure sharing.
Let us consider this, from a customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with complicating operators
The attitude of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby to lower profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
Disturbing around the creation U:fon testify that when operators hold to something they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing towards ČTÚ during the period of creation of U:fon to the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from ČTÚ's web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been largely strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that another competitor’s entry would place on him and above all on his high demand services.”
The attitude of mobile telephony operators is, however, quite surprising to the complete disinterest by Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of ČTÚ that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere with economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, concerns the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of rental of the necessary infrastructure between mobile operator and virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, from the section for external relations ÚOHS, in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators might not be surprising.
Instead of the office which must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of his position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But of course the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UOHS.
It is really shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question as to whether it is really just a coincidence, is put on its own.
Similarly, the same price of petrol for all gasolines is clearly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for his behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator it is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has - at the end of the accounts logically - the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators proceed so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the whole matter.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of UOHS need to know better than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it, when no one looks
While these pseudo-virtual operators remain unaccompanied, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the pre-determined persons.
The magic lies in the fact that the company against the operator appears as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a sale.
"If the cases were to be presented, of which we will be interested, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and it could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," responded to the question Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile telephone operators.
Especially in the cases of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
The activity of these companies derives a non-differentiating profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile operators "
But this ought to be a little weird about ČTÚ.
In addition, there is another issue for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UUOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators were trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, at the too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, the regulators have intervened in defence not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him other ones have been approached.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators start from one another all the time as a boiling potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes them more than comfortable.
But we don't throw the sponge.
If the backstage information is right and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on track.
If one of the operators consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly ÚOHS could remain unable to reject (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State's Day of Recognition, presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m alkj".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem revisions are Otakar Jerériaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear statement, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov męj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" ring sounds
Wednesday MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time even with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the date on which the metro, tram and bus will take the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card.
Right now if you can get it about 100,000 people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the one from 30 and 90 days and annually (which will take place from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card reloaded at Infopoints and at the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, MČstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Sizes can already be purchased on the Internet on the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service took advantage of more than four hundred customers before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the gates in the subway stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cut is purchased via the Internet and the Opencard charge it on one of the 12 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a platform with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the Internet and will also register on their card the credit they have acquired." said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic cuts on the Opencard in ATM and selfservice that are installed at the subway entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket drafters and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrný concluded.
The cut will be controlled instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will run from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cut, you will load it above.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are the controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the temporal and zonal validity," explained Filip ticket control mode by the organization Ropid, which develops the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s case.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard to the point determined next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded size.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded sizes, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," added Drápal.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cut-off expires, can again go to self-service ATMs, where the cut-offs are loaded on paper.
Here you will see the information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The South Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this wish, according to what is said, some groups of Germans of the South turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is mostly due to the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow again the return of the "Dark District" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will reach German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," we write in the letter signed with the words "The people who hold to Šumava's destiny with all their heart".
Because, they say, annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Southeast hope only for brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to assume the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the USA doubted the German conviction of Šumava , it would be sufficient to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, some witnesses rightly describe the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast.
Although the Czech Germans had to be at least aware that this would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the people of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in prison in Holštýn, the tens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"These believed that once the Czech returned home would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia at the top of the war, said he was counting on the fact that on the basis of the Beneš decrees they would have been moved from the Republic.
Don't think you're gonna pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš ★ebíček is expected to discourage drivers from acting dangerously on the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before leaving.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, motocyclists, pedestrians and not finally professional drivers.
What's going to happen on the spot?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think you're gonna pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalised on the plate.
And in a blood well there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots will "fear" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is thus promised to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and stickers to drivers
"With the drivers, the carrot and cane system works.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they pass with red and so they save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
It is necessary to remember the risk to drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that alert the drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of Israeli Provisional Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not all," said Olmert to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the Russians or the plaintiffs to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in the light of the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the premier, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mountain of the temple, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
The withdrawal from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from the heights of Golan, that is, in his view, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to renounce the current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Scith movement); they will have to give up permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Scith movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are Stewards illegal in buses?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that takes long distance
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the company Student Agency's bus came out of question if the steward and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws severely and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week with which he lost his life a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure bus spot at the time, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can do an accident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or not with seats according to the movement book.
If passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing, confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz website the director of Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the passenger movement on the bus.
After he was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation forbids the carrier to perform the services.
The road traffic law only recognises the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds spokesperson Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law is taking care of this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
That's it," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standings and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with standings with higher speed and long traffic without standings with maximum speed permitted and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the escorts on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to service on the planes.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence comes and the flight assistant can kick his head."
"If the bus makes a sudden braking, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in the urban coach or on the tram.
The carrier must resolve the security of the steward by means of an internal regulation," he also says and understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering the services of the steward..
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the Director considers their work dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers while they leave.
They'd also decrease expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of the steward on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we have already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
There has been a great tragedy.
In the accident of the line for Naples, a young hostess from the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a rough maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejected the fact that the two seats reserved for the stewart rest had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long traffic buses, they are inconceivable."
The company intends to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but it is expected to make a financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport have been working for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the Stewart movement on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them so much buses, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone during the drive," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of stewart as a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Havelka, who controls the safety of buses are the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB Director addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday which could form the "centre of the capital market of the financial group of savings banks" through the unit meeting of the bank institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an undertaking.
Moreover, such a whole union could be a decisive boost to further links in the Länder banking sector.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because WestLB's affliction is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU Committee, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having long pointed out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is restricting the search for a future solution.
Links between the Deka-Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB certainly has been talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the invoice of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB doesn't make sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is half brought by the regional banks and the savings banks, delegated the Board of Directors to conduct talks with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, there is no talk of it the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This three-party association didn't do anything about it.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhine-Palatinate regional bank went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba board, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
Apart from this it seems that awareness is created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
For Hellaba, it's not entirely good news.
If the pressure increases for other mergers, partners will be missing by hand.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of savings banks Asia-Turingia participating with 85% of Helaba, put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
The NordLB would only remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses are dealt with.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which the future of the regional banks' business model would be assured, would not yet be given an answer by the German savings banks association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that naturally is not desired.
Thus the letter from the board of directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
THE second weekend of the beer party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them is the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand standing a massive bearded and shows about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first from Luke a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, depart this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Beer Festival" , expected arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not something for the Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with false fur liner and a pair of glasses with silver wide sticks belong to him.
For 5 years go to Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
Nighttime, daytime at the party, back at 22.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at Brenner's.
There's still no beer.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian signboard on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowledge.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tendon means running!", quoted Mark early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we block, and not all the yellow beers sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mouth costs 8,25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave places, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet again at 22.30 p.m. here again!
Yeah, he's going for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow the yellow beers to the trees, road signs and even to an advertising sign of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as "Finth Week of Italians".
The exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Monaco police are strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in the first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendon of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Nights insomnia for the creditors of the Royal Summer
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the finance minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains a billionaire credit from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect themselves from turbulence on markets.
One expert in the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
Deep down, there's the loss of the Depfa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state funder has refinanced in very short term – which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008 the bank reserves had decreased by 95% of the €2.37 million, even the share of its own capital fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current incomes and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain actions as to the liquidation of credit provisions have dropped more than 70% of the 5 million euros.
Thanks only to higher incomes from the refund of subordinated compensation costs that come from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit was moderate enough by about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had been lost in the speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were dismembered in the Area Bank.
Given that income in the classic state funding was too low, Depfa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private and state (PP) investment projects and has diversified internationally.
The Hippo Real Estate must now depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been deleted.
By 2007, 2/3 had been reduced.
The Royal Hypo Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important financer of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs a portion of the Depfa's credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hippo Real Estate's notice, the group's financial requirement was covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functioning.
From other sources you feel, that thanks to the money the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee, on the contrary, said that the HRE Group would not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group's marketability is still assured.
This is expected for shareholders and bank creditors.
In view of the dynamics and taxation of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But even the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After Sunday night the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The equity course falls by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They do quite well in the course of the mortgages.
While the front-debts are almost unmovable, they give up the courses of deferred credits.
Hits are mainly the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate, understandably dues that expire beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, which with the importance of the Depfa has ended the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Only when the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, can you count on a depreciation of the annualities within the deadline.
Or it will take place, what no one hopes for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But you are referring to the information that has been overturned because of partial stateizations, the probability almost certainly has become a justified hope.
It will, above all, create long-term investors some sleepy nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the return on losses for future interest rate payments.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should come to Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to redecorate: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I had a good time going to school.
Dress on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
The road was supposed to be alone and fortunately I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren come flat from 8 to 8.40 until a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who talks willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren
Since I didn't have school uniforms yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like that, I stood in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Soyonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in one week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, rolled and marked and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "caring, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me embarrassed, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson hour continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking disorderly and laughing and drying me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break they all opened their Bento.
My host mother also gave me the basket for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu envelopes..
I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
It is done, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salts, brr!
Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a Benedict made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my manga comic books.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked me my friends when I told them, that I would have wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I've been reading the Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn some Japanese language.
I was absolutely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
Here they keep us a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a scaffold flee when they feel the danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way, they have our feelings?
The Internet "Edge" newspaper has been published for some years by well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or someone else so far able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things as the other animals do. That means he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the side-frontal cortex with human awareness, associated circuits (this for its direct sharing to short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among the other creatures it misses completely.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, it is thus accepted the basis on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic particularity should appear in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said to be related to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of the consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
Animal consciousness processes could be analyzed without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness that to causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
So what's going on for feelings?
I charge them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the system of defense located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the cortex regions, which characterize primates and in particular human beings.
With the speaking nature you create subtle nuances of feeling, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from the most primitive activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and of the cephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, which however focused more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
At a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I think it is unproven.
Pankseep brings arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears as fear, is likely to feel so with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and human beings experience the same thing when they behave in the same way?
Does a escalation in case of danger escape as if he even felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephalus, scarfs not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalo responsible for feelings?
And when could it even be demonstrated for human beings: how would it be shown on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at neural level, provided that the same procedure is waived on rats and men.
As I don't search language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered myopic, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually banging against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional.
The President of UEFA Platini: deferral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the EU in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europes with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries"
Both countries of home master countries are in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages to be used for Europe will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki said to the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for EMs 2012 will not suffer."
Many of the first division only in last season were condemned for manipulation, in the end it had to be postponed to the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid was outraged.
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he talked about the private and now he has grain with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid adulterated.
He foams with rage and rebuffs.
War of the Roses at the start delayed by the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two actors of Hollywood now quarrel with each other a bad dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week expressed himself on the grounds of marriage failure: "Dennis has been a long time unfaithful, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayal she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "stolen of the soul" was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adulteration is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adultery husband was clear: it would be "unheard," said the fifty-fourth to the "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the last time repeats and recreates the history of our relationship".
It would also be "sadly" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "publicly remember the pain and subvertment, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from separation, Quaid is again married and will soon become father to twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are down
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3,6 % lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quote of the dollar, which would have led to a "heating desire to travel American tourists"
Even financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still stands up:
Due to the increase in Kerosene passengers in the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets dropped by 12.5% on average compared with the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9 %, in the second quarter fell by 23.6 %.
As for the German domestic flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price drop would be lower economic growth on the one hand, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, there would be the open sky agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
The critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the Hamburg VS becomes a capoly.
The Luhukay Bourussia still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the player of the national Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player first came into play late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated precisely, he passed it on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of it sat in its place again.
Rieger has been for almost 3 decades of HSV physiotherapist, enjoying an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol announced and raised his thumb in a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero those in Hamburg must thank the head shot by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak gladbach players could not have hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a dirty victory," reepilogated Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated earlier, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing classification on the screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We can put everything right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the present, that the provisional table certificate is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen blown at FC Bayern – finds it slowly, but it has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling", relaunchs Jol forcefully.

Dark matter influences space probe flight
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einsteins' relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-frozen fuel pipes, it is now her death for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the/or Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the space probes, with which they obtain additional splash/spin/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical forwarding as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised scholars for years: rockets do not behave at all as expected by the Gravitation Act.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year has been renamed the anomaly of the Swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have witnessed in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
From the existence of dark matter, space scholars have known only for about 10 years.
She evidently comes out of a force of attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is seen.
Instead, she is completely invisible, i.e. she neither sends nor reflects any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
The kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers turned out to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
Germans are always on the lookout for kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This has been a concordance to Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the release of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a shipment in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstages of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released are still unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready to conclude the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army had killed 6 of them in surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed for a ransom," the official said.
It would be "still trying to take the hostages into delivery", when suddenly this "surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of the amount of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should have stayed in custody until the kidnappers had had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, Cornwallia, has been in prison for six years after he has admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly bothered his daughter-in-law Stephanie Randle when she was five to seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise was harassing her and waving her before she had sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to Cornwall.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a long time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "divided with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is thought that she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound her and bound her."
"I didn't sexually disturb her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim who takes away his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would have been difficult for the facts to be finished before the court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
"Further it was clearly probable that she was a promising and happy young woman of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing suggesting a criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought this was treated internally at the Mod and the Office of Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguard of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Building companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion pounds will eventually be paid when Bradford & Bingley loans will be redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the resumed market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect the construction societies and their members from what could be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk salts 5 penny a litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of his milk for an extra five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two penny in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Disclaimer to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bail for exorting 50 million taka (729,700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of the many allegations of corruption against you.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is planned for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, has asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military will give him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high court refused the claim for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina returned home after 17 October, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government joined the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-police campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you can't reach the children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban that would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee said that BSkyB's participation hampered the competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of participation in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, leading the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB Argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportioned Remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender it voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical towards the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was taken out of fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The public prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Series of charges concerning potentially criminal behaviors have not been fully investigated or cleared," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers had been fired for expired performance.
But later it appeared that lawyers who had been fired had not been evaluated more than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial proceedings against high-profile members of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but may not be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other officers in the Department of Justice were fired.
(The report by the Inspector General was very critical in relation to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in dismissals, which had abdicated on his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of the 1977 album by Meat Loaf.
Coldplays will lead appointments for this year's prizes, being on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But the album by Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell was almost nine years old and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapse on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it emerged that it had a cyst on a vocal rope.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran and resident keyboards for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic road.
There's no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlantic.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say they were hit by the road truncated simply because it was one of the last remnants of the señorile district of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Use of Land of the Municipal Commission of the Surroundings, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 District.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seating places, including some to use for a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokesperson, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public threat," he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Housing, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical print.
Some believe that he took his name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the cover set for the album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of dirt, brandy of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Regrets: A little nostalgic look at the city in the process of extinction"), published part of a discourse on the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow street without exit, also dark of day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with sarainsques, with old newspapers of weeks that flow along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent night.
A rat ran smoothly through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic shop of clothes.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of empty 22 ounce beer lay near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby have said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that he would need to be a little beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior student in California and senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Truly attracting the Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "Afro-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these deficiencies in achieving the objectives, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have arrived recently, are studying English.
But among the fourth graders, one surprising 100 percent of the students did the upper level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-grad students did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes rendition and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuse" type.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a great success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered the 12-month class after you would not have been able to identify who she was."
"It works," he observed "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools with a Spanish majority and English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr. Obama's response from being predicted.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the issue trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply and economic fear is renewed
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the crude fell from 7% to $99.80 per barrel to the New York merchant bag in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before going up again, on the background of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after Congress leaders said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from being passed.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frantic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, it is expected that demand for raw materials, including oil, will calm down.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape infection.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while household oil consumption due to slow economic growth, reducing forecasts for the price of oil and gas by about 20% for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything.
Then he watched the event take place on Sunday's second quarter, when the Jets turned a game without points into a rimont.
"But seeing something like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equalized the grayness of the threatening clouds that overpowered them with a faint game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Lavernues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't leave my path," said Favre of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback heavily.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a loose launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
The security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last shifter, the forced fumble by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went to the advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a target of 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever marked in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe his madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second or the third?"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small time frame."
Retired Gebsselassie exceeds its record of the world
Haile Gebsselassie of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favourably flat at 2:03:59, Gebslelassie sends in French for 27 seconds its previous score of 2:03:26, last year's course in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebslelassie has developed the 26th record in the world of such an amazing career that has produced a world championship or a world record at any distance from metric mile to marathon.
Last month, Gebslassie jumped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebslassie won on Sunday with a 4 minutes and 43 seconds average per mile.
As soon as half as founders like Gebslelassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone long, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory of Sunday, Gebslassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps on his thumbs and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebslassie said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything went well."
He was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on the apilist as if it were a mid-fund race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebslelassie as a marathon.
With the passage due from four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebslassie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held the Gebslassie competition after the apilists disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebslelassie made a final rush to separate from Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, improving its best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games have been lost with what is described as a bad accident, but it is cured to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, noise, enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first whole black town incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown Skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that makes tourists stop understanding it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, he doesn't know what is going on."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential appointee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain dissident from the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shade of the oaks of rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disgruntled, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through honest books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside the Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida in a black story and human drama scenario
Low as a frog in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with its white finishes, with its well-preserved gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second weddings and sex.
Clearly, this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora told him what he was like," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes her by quoting men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
Adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was down in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many people were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were humming.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, waving on his chair on the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "they never remained for long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plateless tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, and no major conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-way highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western boundary of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing carried hatred on the community's door.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a coke out of a car."
In a letter of 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honour for my race".
The residents now say that the breakdown of schools, although they have been positive in some respects, undermines Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardises the confidence of its young people.
"The black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as he did, with happy self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the Hurston plateless tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston hit the bookseller shelves, re-entering it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as her most famous daughter had again blocked the lights of the slope.
And this time, the old neighbours of Hurston saw her as a lifesaver.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its road plan.
"The five tracks on the resurfacing highway, they brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the imagination that the city has of itself.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to rival the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard re-enacted and beautified.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as the Hurston festival expanded, there was also a high level of citizen pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, no worse and fair, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's grandson Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they have just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after the mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the banks of the newspapers and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not notice to be in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that glass offices, nestled on their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York each day live the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
Farmers shake metal trolleys for the tea through the sidewalks, transporting muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts stretched on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still wait in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from the places the pendulums make, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called trifft (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and commits who were standing in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a secure port, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and his emaciated Director General Dick Full in all familiarity, as if complaining of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the door in uniform, almost fifty years of my condominium, has changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my spending.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring signs like those road representatives mosques with a red line passing through.
The police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties of the far-right gained a lot from the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits drew Jewish symbols with spray like David's Star above some graves, but detectives believe it might have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which occurred toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
Meanwhile, Austria embarked on a spiritual search trip following its right-hand turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned with highly anti-immigrant tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against sails and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, leading them to be political symbols of continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that change was mainly carried out by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I travel abroad to Gary Glitter.
At Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, was prohibited from travelling to France and Spain from court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that they were controlling him to want to go to Spain by passing from France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he gave the magistrates the evidence of Glitter's previous arrest for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford preture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesperson said: "Tuesday, September 25, at Ashford preture, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the registry of convicted sexual offences.
He must give information to the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities may lead to a five-year prison sentence.
Kent's police said they didn't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesperson said, "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who stays in the United Kingdom because we have the right complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sexual offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10-year-olds.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to embark on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have brought him to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
At last he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge preture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him in the register of convicted sexual offences.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt assured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor fly nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go to the scene.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
To this end, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To pick up the personality of these great ones you don't need to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long way to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plated camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, have been and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portrait Portraits" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or meet people, characters you don't even know at times, or they only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a "smart"
It is set in places that still do not know and deal with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is in the grip of a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Ever since the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project that is being dealt with today "is a mess" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it as well and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw pass through the town of Acqueducto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as a forecast, the figure of prominence at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" book, filled the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom time was flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, evoked in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasant pleasure of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "inspired lack of inspiration", with intense work of documentation, writing and continuous repetition; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories hold.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, it has "effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformist." That is why he invited writers to "not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" of their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has hit this festival, preventing two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the performance of the second race of bulls.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by collecting greetings and an ear, more granted by the public than by virtue of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, the fisks of most of the public were earned.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish past the block in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents are bullying the two occupants of a truck that instead of stopping they run away.
Agents have incited the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping on the run.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers after pursuing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement in the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials from the road of Alava were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop a truck for the inspection when the driver, failing the orders, hurried up sharply and crossed the block.
The agents went into pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a forested area.
The agents of Ertzaintza managed to arrest one of the fugitives and to kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they carried and took notice once inspected the van, a Iveco Daily.
The hashish panets, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the truck documentation, the arrest was also charged with the offence of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspected person, who has managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old prisoner A.A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge within the next few hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of medicines
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out with the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed to the magazine People by a spokesman of the California road.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "shunned down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the car with sudden maneuvers ahead and back. Backward, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and got out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led him to a specialist drug and alcohol facility to test her.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has proved collaborative and the hypothesis of alcohol excess has been discarded from the beginning, even though "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
Locklear was arrested with suspicion of driving under the effect of some not better specified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being admitted to an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The coordinator-general of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the prosecution of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares with regard to the resolution that the party will have to adopt with respect to what it has so far been an adviser to the Council in Seville.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations concerning the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI always wanted this kind of investigation to have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Blood of May", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodyos Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de May the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to " illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Sangre de May, for more than two and a half hours, debuted this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
The great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes he has to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before playing a commemorative film for the second centenary of 2 May Madrid. The director had agreed that the story of basing on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated throughout the Madrid Community represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenographies and costumes to portray a "a clumsy Spain that failed the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los ghosts de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the script that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Return to begin, has influenced what is his habitual work practice, the performance with the actors, with which he often uses to try before going around with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliant," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom belong in the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - win one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates this year represent Spain at the Academy of Hollywood - its Blood of May, Seven tables de billiard French and, the last selected Los girasols blind - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci no prize is expected.
"At first you think you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at a certain point you agree to simply shoot an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Swiss essence of the Ballerina Tortola Valencia
One Swiss dancer pays tribute to another same dancer in Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
This woman's life, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character.
He maintains the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell his whole life, but to gather his spirit.
His dance titles suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tanghi.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic," she explains.
The scene provides two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he does "The Open Door"; and that of Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been a student.
"Matilde plays Adult Turtle, the character of maturity.
I'm happy because he agreed to work in my work and that's what I feel very honored."
The set also includes musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violet of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been turned round, and who have always had many exhilarating."
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, because he usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it's one of the women who had a huge influence in a given period of history and now nobody remembers it and much less considers its work as something of value," Bayon says.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poete newly married" the Triennio is also closed
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poete Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Councillor of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trianio of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for the Literature and Death of both.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillorate for Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poete Reciencasado", by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and work of one of the highest value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The sentence is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the disturbing idea that Newman left.
And yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one proves goes beyond any expression, and now I've lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and home died at a particularly dark time, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on earth, looking desperately for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there are good people to admire, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opposer of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn who died of overdose to the creation of the brand of domestic and biological food.
All gifts to a country in which it took a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man didn't die, ended a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, tried to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for rectitude and having a serious and distant privacy life on cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly lacked the opportunity not to be.
"Why am I going to eat outside hamburger today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, of none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, eager and passionate grandfather and philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we were to follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion, it was by far the worst I ever witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were then taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the removal of the backbone, which assumed that it would go first.
It didn't seem like a wrong idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to take everything away (including chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You just had to go to take the backbone (first nonsense, only go for it) and (after its tail), surprise! they only had 'S' size shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable from the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting tail was 15 minutes and, more importantly, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasts more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was predictable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion were added and assaulted to the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have the pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will not come into my thoughts.
So I think we're gonna keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft searches for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video for example the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that it does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of society.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many programs associated.
Steve Ballmer found out that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less charged with commercial garbage, it would take five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "less".
All one discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly stress that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same thing as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more attention to the web browser.
You only take your computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and you spend more time daily browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What are half the applications of the operating system for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they can be a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of Microsoft employees' recreation rooms in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the beverage machine a sign encourages them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to do a network search.
Last week, after all, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sange', as well as Al Pacino ne 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the force with the pointed mustaches that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is essentially a typical man-made shirt, with the inside of cotton, tied and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands above all.
The "Marcel" is excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cutting, for its badge and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), that the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as details on the neck.
The "Marcel" is excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cutting, for its badge and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), that the most iconic shirt models carry as details on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous "tank".
It also includes high school sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor T-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great similarity with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new activities in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, quickly conquers you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what items does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like cinema in the '50s is '60s, we get various inspirations from here.
Then, I love to lose in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that, even if in the end, everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
As a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to flea in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid very much attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they give you the wardrobe, it's the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you're 30 years old, you're in crisis?
But no.
I never felt better. I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have good experience in enjoying life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because I'm asking for my own body and I want to be a young mother, which I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I'm not too concerned.
What I will do will be give my son much happiness and educate him with great love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting to see some films shot in different rooms last year.
That's right, and I want them to scan.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be that way.
I want you to go "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you were on the bridge as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, has called me to invite me to go to London to attend a charity show for her organization "Gifts for a better world" and the clothes we have exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO in Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I have known her for a long time can confirm that they are not so true.
Besides, I find myself in this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done the same.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't pull back.
Alcoholic relapsers will have to install "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol in their blood, to install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of darkness or if it does not blow itself into the particular device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
This initiative, in addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, will participate in the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Motor Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of reported motorists reported more than once per driving in a state of darkness then returns to drive the car.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a vehicle-related system that measures the alcohol rate in the breathed air and prevents the driver from setting up if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than the permitted one.
The cost is higher than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices would reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE to install this system in schools buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, second programme, the Spanish plane in which the Asturias principles were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico City.
The sun was falling but the rays still forced the hand to be used as a visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the way, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to charge people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you've been here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well...
The Mexican press knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 sailors offering honorary greetings.
The prince looks smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, windy, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the room where the official board awaits them.
At the hotel door where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, awaits them a spirited reporter of Mexican television.
The best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and probably no more exquisite designer and Bont viva di Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango window at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from the excitement.
Furthermore, it is the second largest firm in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite paintings, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with the broken heart and making necessity virtues, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a house dress and some complements of ELAH to take away the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of tribute.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and the knight who finished, along with Baron Rothil, without a jacket, because they had both surrendered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the palace rooms, but had first shown us his son's photos on his cell phone.
The next day, we were pleased with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another young man who moved by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously been assured that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh here, it's life.
1001, the number antistress
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it squirms every morning at 7:00 p.m. but it is even worse to imagine getting involved in the frenzy rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office's called tension and the computer's got a bad back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods to fight daily exhaustion and difficulty getting rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, a whole "menu" of tailor-made options for everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in such areas as work or in personal relationships, this "manual" denies such conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow in your veins to regain the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off the mind and focus on reading.
Talking in the Sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak while sleeping.
The first time it happens, at most it takes a scare, but it doesn't really matter very much.
This is a benign alteration of the sleep defined dreamword.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely most of you told me that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (doing pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it may be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
Even the intensity with which it appears to be extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite occurs (screams, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are generating anomalous state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We said that this is a benign alteration, therefore, there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, on the other hand, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to bed.
Propose quiet games and avoid television programs or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepy words appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's happening, and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very anxious and episodes have a certain frequency it is best to consult a doctor or check where there is such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming of saying it, so you must pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell the baby that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like that causes a great deal of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory at home after a long fruitless period.
Without playing a great game, the Yellow-Blacks have created the largest number of network opportunities transforming one into the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting when the attackers expressed themselves in difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who took the seven with a shot away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from far away, then Hirn high, Romain peak and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the camp, leaving only the Riahi spark at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the canonier of the Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later thus leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put great problems on the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just to "enforce" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball ran the cross.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Britain.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who have brutally prevented access to several ports of Breton and Normans on Monday, the President of the Republic has decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that it will "approach with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place in conjunction with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the impenetration of the price of diesel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesperson, the president will "dispute with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and ensure the working conditions and pay for sailors".
The fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumaca operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of swallows.
Also the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but connections with Belle-Island have not been interrupted.
A roadblock was implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking up demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the vessels remained at the dock, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the block of the total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and possible participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not yield" et "they do not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorent Fishing Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the limit of return of a vessel is only reached with a diesel less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut home.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer company has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threat of recession affecting the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company trusts widely in the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the transfer of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, it specifies the paper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evenings to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to assign include the aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessional from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeds that of 17 September 2001, when the stock exchanges were reopened following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technology titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street is sunk after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability back to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two in three Republicans refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market counts on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it could already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dying (...) then the witness would quickly pass on to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the U.S. Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, he stressed the Piegza.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachowia's banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has skyrocketed, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the United Kingdom banks, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The return of the Treasure Goods expired at 10 years was reduced to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday evening, while the return to 30 years is 4.161%, against 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama in favour of the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, here's a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general neighborhoods of the Republican and Democratic Campaign proclaimed their respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls from the presidential.
The Gallup Institute, whose published opinion poll on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive voters, found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, who was expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good sense," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the opponent regarding the arguments faced during the first face-to-face.
"St. Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he often said to multiple shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What has been a continuing target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," he said, this weekend, a democratic spot, rebuking the Republican for not taking the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, reported Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a storming rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes to Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the cliff.
"The next week could be a decisive turn," he considered, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intention to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating its intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's findings, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
The two candidates prudently addressed the questions focused on the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday evening the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opposers demonstrated on Sunday evenings in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evenings immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some confess that they didn't even vote: "What pro? They'll do whatever they want, by my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that that regime that has made a good impression of the external observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote strip," Iouri Potemkine, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a façade change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidents and leader of the pro-European movement, since the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may include a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Since if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the polling.
He stressed that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) gave rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? asks Social-Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the election seats.
And there will have been no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient to power."
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Election Committee were pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDecary, had every reason to rejoice, for Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shocked by the scandal of infected blood in the years 1980-1990.
As we know, national reserves of blood managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying to draw up a report, some provinces have set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, only 38% of the people stated that they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to the continued efforts to improve the safety of blood withdrawals and field research over the following years, we have regained the confidence of the public," he said before he was proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells of those who have been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we did not know at all whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
We have therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau relations, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, take exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted by infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow donors to directly recognize the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TAN have allowed to reduce the window period, since the person has contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be identified in the blood through our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus significantly diminished.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion occurs.
I believe that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the Hema-Québec leadership.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, Chikungunya virus appeared on the Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in blood by an insect.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before we stress that, in addition to having safe resources, the Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Necessity increases as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 years and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of poverty are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and cannot make donations anymore.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today life is so frantic that it is difficult to find one hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Hema-Québec that manages the only public bank of the blood of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can help cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth sample of cordon blood and we plan to take more than a thousand of them every year.
You should start to propose them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't access you," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal of the eliminations of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarter final, at Saputo Stadium.
The central camper Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino marked the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Let's remember that at the first game of the way back, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
Impact will face Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return match by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed during the day.
In brief - decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadian and its axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game phase winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and picked up a passage for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
He decided to win the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, said Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to tear it up in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest tip north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the start of the elections before the end of the year.
Following the conclusion of the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon yesterday, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected during today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments with strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image mill".
On three maxi screens, they confused negative spectacles of hydroelectric dams, mining, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in full election campaign.
During the press conference, on the other hand, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- the northern territory at the 49th parallel- had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has just explained why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but he has not spoken about timing or investment quotas, as he has not explained exactly what will be the priorities in the implementation of future projects.
Most of all, he simply pointed out what he saw as a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has undergone several improvements.
According to the list styled by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory twice as large as France", is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he insists on us," he insisted, as if he wanted to solicit a national myth founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity comes, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
Moreover, "in view of climate change, it is necessary to re-evaluate the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will be open all year long because of the meltdown of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Hungarian PQ), have already opened up the consultation of some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) occupies an important role, began work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "they will provide themselves with common visions"
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "consulted, ordered and will respect the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first Liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Centrale Beauharnois in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another conservative reference is made this time to John Diefenbaker's "Street to the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the project on the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stated that its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains among us, but I feel we will do it," he confessed to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not miss the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very busy, particularly in a mission of the federal council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend has provided the Liberal leadership with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smooth as oil: the PLQ calls above all for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will have the names of members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the Northern Plan outline was welcomed in a skeptic way.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, repulsed the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, "we would have progressed today," said Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADAQ stated that it supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for, is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, substitute for Mario Dumont, who is coming back today from the holidays.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" of Harper's cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a " ashamed" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought unceasingly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the prime minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not returned a citizen held in the concentration camp of Guantanamo.
A government that does not at all take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the alleged facts occurred.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier run in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for Omar Khadraffin's return so that he can undergo a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes the eyes before torture: it is very little matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of oppression.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop showing and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we are when there is no morals anymore: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today as a minority (to see what will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect for the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame is right here, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
On September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
In pursuit of an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation complaint by six million against three authors and a small square publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a dispute over defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to ruining anyone dares to support a position contrary to theirs.
Little matter what the outcome of the process is, the writers and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a large amount of money in order to organize their defense and to fight, to decidedly learned weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by virtually no-fund pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these arms struggles learned, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation which envelops the opposition as well as to frighten anyone who dares to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is first of all public opinion that she should have presented her own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates usually take place with the exchange of views rather than with manganel blows.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and falsely rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is very obvious?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word indicates only the perfumed lawyers paid and not the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does it first because it rejects the brutal means taken by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilian exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of embalming (researching for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum intimatum inducing them to suspend the use of that word...)
Apart from Garver's surreal speech, Barrack Gold's dispute constitutes a direct attack on freedom of university research and on the pursuit of the truth, which is indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss matters that are uncomfortable to the richest businesses in the world, who can do so, with multiple complaints?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it by following scientific rules as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to his claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as does the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures to limit abusive complaints.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the heads of Congress, representatives of the republican and democratic coalition, finally reached an agreement on the largest safeguard-financial plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollar plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money, new provisions to contain the number of cases for defaults, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to the directors of the protected companies.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street."
"It is the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, inestimable inconveniences and disturbances would have been poured out on the everyday lives of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The deadline for opening the markets this morning corresponded to the opening of the markets.
Finally, the two candidates for the US presidency were quite in favour of the agreement, but they did not want to express their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will allow the owners to maintain their home and that which is related to remuneration for the managers of companies covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice over.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As I have read, this is something that we all have to say and that will allow us to go on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to re-purchase with taxpayers' money the doubts, risk and non-sale assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble which led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (many) , then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the abandonment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge who aired the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulty was only protected by the government rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at the Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the course of five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to be added to if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain participation quotas in the protected companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that will be able to resale when the waters are calmed.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for borrowing real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
From today onwards, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be opened up.
Yesterday there were different votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic coalition.
"Of course, Washington doesn't feel you," he said, addressing his constituents, Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Finance Committee of the House.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at the Congress nicknamed "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say : we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas reported that it would have given up the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) for the crisis of venture real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of Europe's twenty largest banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's no lost money," said the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Boss yesterday.
In return, there is influence and right to vote in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families now appreciate that times are announcing uncertainty"
During this period, at the other end of the Manica, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in bile for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that you will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty from the blue eyes was for a long time its ace in the sleeve, for others its weak point.
Was he freed from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the sickening smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Magical children are often born from mixed couples.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Since in him a whole country was recognized by the safe made man, the warrior of the war of the Pacific, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the motor driver who ranked according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a couple model since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, busy star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to reveal the mystery completely.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart dive for the cinephiles, while his great characters populated the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is reproposed through its interpretations.
They confuse in memory the fascinating cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to wish his wife focused (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof that hatched adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember this in the cloths of sensitive Mr Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have moved on to history.
The Gratian Rocky Boxer, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassu, someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute evil in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Lo Spaccone, Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which he earned in 1987 the only oscar on 9 appointments.
That face through the years, it was his.
Him again.
Epochs happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for George Roy Hill's cult movie Slap Shot-Dry hit (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of a low-orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's age in 2003.
Unlike the latest cinema legends that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in the halls, denouncing Hollywood in all its costumes, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, defined him, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performance to be exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholics carobs or desperate, of which he expressed his disbandment and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, sensibility.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a thin portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and sad.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade of arms Robert Redford (who had acted together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness" His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career of legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger of the Hollywood drift is thus turned off.
We will have spread her face out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was intended for its Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, instead of clinging to his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And so much privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the factory of invoices of Zuschlag & partners?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within an association of delinquents that have caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from competition notices has been used by them for private purposes, and have often certified the carrying out of the activities by means of false invoices.
State and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, has ended in part in the boxes of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, reported by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from tendering notices on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased on the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were made in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among others during the journey between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for consumption, on the model of these then were prepared the invoices to be forwarded to competition calls, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András ★ri, who, according to our information, has drawn up above all the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant has provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, so many people, according to the restorator, would not all go into the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, a package of formal and content errors.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however there were 130 guests in the invoice.
But the compilators of the invoices full of fantasy have overstated when they reported the Pigal Kft., it also deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned and showed him the invoices, he soon realized that these were false documents.
"On the stamp our company's name and Iva match were in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons there was not even the fact that according to the invoice one hundred people were accommodated, when in total there are eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
The invoice was for catering and their restaurant was no longer in operation for long.
The assistant invoice compilers did not worry to inform themselves that the travel agency in Budapest of their choice, only organizes travel abroad, so they abruptly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
Moreover, as shown during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while travel to countries outside the European Union is free of VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, and the employees of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of one company indicated as activities carried out road freight, as is known from the Procedural Procedure, activities that were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Also for formal defects - cause formed non-compliant invoice, false stamp - was discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that Nyregyháza's HIB Kft. was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had eaten you up, which is precisely why the company's liquidator, according to our information, refused to have issued that invoice.
They have issued invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták in favour of the foundation Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and members of the current liquidation Biogate Kft, which in 2003 provided invoices of about 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Even money movement because the invoices prepared were then removed, but associations forgot to make this part of their documents appear.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to contact the Director-General of the Trió Kft Delta, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with fuel trade and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director general of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged having issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian murals founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment BT.
However, none of these companies were operational, because according to the accused they had not received a job.
However, the companies made him useful because, at the request of the co-invoicing lawyer Zsolt Szente, the editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generácio.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has released 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The prosecutor considers that Kubatov has raised 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont contest notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban for the public utility entity of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
So that this doesn't go to cock, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the veil on everything.
His confession has not been very detailed so far, and although he has promised to talk more and more times, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, that Socialists may also have agreed with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to make the goat scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also be offended by his requests to alleviate his prison conditions, that is to say, the granting of house arrests, have so far not found a hearing.
While the perpetrators of commercial offences cannot be compensated and cause much more damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of auctioning in excess: why spend more money?
To auctions buyers are likely to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and researchers at the University of New York have succeeded in discovering the neuro-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study in Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
Research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played in the lot, the other group of players participated in a auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body slammed under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into function when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the price raise is explained by scanning the vehemently reaction of the strata body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial follow-up investigation.
In this investigation three groups have tendered against a partner under different conditions.
They reported to the control group how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides that they promised that in the case of winning they would receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received $15 before auction, but the group members would have lost their money in case of auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other, the loss.
By testing the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but among the first causes of death, chronic liver disease is mentioned in Hungary.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients is 100 thousand, of which only 7000 are cared for: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
Hepatitis definition is the collective name of the contagious liver disease caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and iteritis, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against virus A and B is useful, and against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two-three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and dark urine, healing occurs within two-three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdulge the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analyses.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory test also reveals the disease, it is worth addressing your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the context of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and to the same atheists, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University are also involved.
The test was exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermelin by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary would give rise to a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and felt it had peaceful effect.
Subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time ring received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious or other painting.
Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of them" and "they calmed down and were permeated by peace".
Looking at the religious theme image they realized 12% less pain than when they had before them the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, however, you need to find the right image.
"We must look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of such caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in people's pockets and in heaven above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatient clinic they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is not enough yet.
What concerns skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see exactly the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "We're putting into a system all the information in the world!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like Google to know how to answer questions like "how do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but the software doesn't know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches are recorded exactly what words are searched for, which IP address are searched for, and on which page those interested will stop after the search.
By means of the Personalized Search started two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can concern what they have searched and clicked, these for a long time will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I care about? - worrying users of Google data monopoly are asked.
In most cases the counter-reactions of the inmates are caused by the fear proven by the size of the potential power represented by the company, not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of individuals.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazil's pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made possible the identification of pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
On the other hand, the individuals concerned with personal rights suffered relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even then Google cannot be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped up nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand research expressions obtained with reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years ago, but it failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Therefore, Google's judgment is rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are Google because they believe that in this way their privacy and privacy will be affected by starting to use their services and rise with the rebellion of the multinationals who stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code kept always updated and the program package is much more accessible, young and cooler than the official software giant practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal and internet rights, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 only talks about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communicative channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which its most recent photo galleries appear automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
In the meantime, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the joint circle of friends, comes easily to know who spent the night with her faithful boy or a company can fire her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the corporate summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and thus we can formulate the fundamental thesis that lies behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (e.g., starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but who at the same time does not leave any traces voluntarily).
There are not very few people who do not register on community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion is not even waiting so secretly for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, services introduced in record time instead cause large mischievous not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely refused the protest of employees after doubling the line of the company asylum, has considered the repeated food to please employees too costly, but this decreases in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has nailed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter out all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal company rule seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project will assume such proportions that the firm will soon be in front of the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our reports, medical and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scrogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped the double homicide of ózd to make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were thoroughly suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - declared Tuesday the spokesperson of the Police Investigation of the Borsod region.
Young people have recognized the crime they have been charged with, they are currently being accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI's information, defend themselves on foot.
Favoration is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man in the place, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated murder for profit.
The investigation showed that the twenty-three-year-old had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a yard in Ózd where he and his nine-year-old daughter killed him.
According to information from MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Stock Exchange of Warsaw offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech krona, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the Polish offer despite the Czechs' previous exclusion from the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far have presented an offer to the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance with a quota of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11.
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American President – accuses La Repubblica – who has not been able to compact his party behind a fast-absorbed law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the edge of the barbeque.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and this will suffer later all over the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the Congress's vote there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended into air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to abandon the threat - mention the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to the banking financial institutions and with taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the financial markets broken down.
Only Monday, the weakened financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which there seems to be an increasing amount of anxiety that European taxpayers, like Americans, will also have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
"Savers" must not immediately deflate EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they were to determine in which case taxpayers' money should be allocated to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the calabron
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if you don’t imitate the sensors of the obstacles in nature?
Like bees.
In the amazing project presented to CEATEC in Japan, calabrons gave the initial strategic direction to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mini car equipped with bees properties, with the ultimate purpose of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the Kazuhiro Two exhibition, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of bee view, capable of a display of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have attracted the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of the bee view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a control to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, changes immediately turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance movement, unlike the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If it weren't for that reason, the robot car wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot auto project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful layer and more internal of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebeat.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
Thus, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as possible, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is greater than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the intensity of the intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot must process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a few tens of Kb memory.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions which, they anticipate at Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further application possibilities can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the child's very expensive name.
The written version of the $700 billion savings law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first passage half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted up to midnight on Saturday according to Eastern Coast time, Congress leaders decided the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of American Representatives that it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan's compromise.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but about the reversal of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 o'clock in Washington (2 at night Monday after the time of Central Europe), but did not make a great increase in the exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the project called the 2008 Economic Stabilisation Act concerning the programme, after which it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House with joy.
We are pleased with the progress achieved last night and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesman of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with credits disproportionately behind it.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend up to half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will purchase securities with credits disproportionate to the back, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program to which the president of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time purchase credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "vene" claims.
The purchase may take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent Ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The managers of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid believe instead that the government will limit their return, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold parachute.
Limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, as well as limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires under a auction, it will impose an overcrowding on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the retired bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate claims, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not overstated.
In addition, the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - the measure was commented on by Democratic Barney Frank, President of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain if the economy, and with it the bank saved, will be set up again.
The proposal includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress a proposal which provides how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to the taxpayers.
Of course from both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, not to defend the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican deputy of California Darrell Issa.
Her democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by them who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Institute of Hungarian Statistics.

As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to one year ago.
The prices of the previous month's domestic industrial sales rose only by 0.1%.
National sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1%, compared to July.
The increase in prices in August 2008 took place in the field of leather and shoes processing (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in the processing of wood (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry there has been an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, given the domestic sales of the manufacturing industry, the biggest increases have occurred in the processing of oil products (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products derived from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco represented a decisive weight.
A decrease in prices was seen in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of increase in prices varies from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the manufacturing industry last year prices rose by 10.2%.
The prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7% last year's prices.
In domestic sales among target groups of sectors, the highest monthly price increase occurred in August in sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods prices have increased by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sector prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, higher prices were observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in guilders increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared in 12 months by 3.9%.
The Hungarian guilder in about one month weakened compared to the euro of 1.7%, compared to the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and by 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "it now depends on the Sed'Ocean fact, the electronic system of entry and control is built in time."
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be entry permit, but before the departure tourists will have to be registered.
The Hungarian diplomacy officer will continue negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order Cross of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will meet with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, have assured their support for the government plan of $700 billion for bank rescue, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial disengagement package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be better suited to getting the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys of Obama's economic agenda, he again recovered a little bit of advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican Convention with the appointment of Vice-President Sarah Palin, was dispersed.
Obama in a speech to Detroit expressed the hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," said a crowd of 35,000.
He didn't let himself get away with defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all those who are going to send down this situation with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a way to go".
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good exits of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
German-language press review
The pole on the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-conscious - so analyses Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU has already begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple entered into office.
Christian-socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so does Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago was feasible: the indisputable hegemony of a state-party ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated at 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still during the period of so much mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernization carried out accordingly in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists have predicted it already 40 years ago, but have failed much of the time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation is the same as increasing possibilities and the political consequences are clear.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that over the past few weeks, the classic bourgeois groups have left the CSU: the free professionals, the artisans, the diplomats and the graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40% here.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative daily Viennese "Who With Who?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" it deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created after the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now it rotates everything around the coalition; in the public TV debate the party leaders just showed the cards.
Werner Faymann president of SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor.
As you have stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Manyerer responded prudently to red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ has repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are ready to assume responsibility for governing," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation needs to be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised this year by France having the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of Parliament Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress drew attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and to come the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major civil and equal opportunities European organisations.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, pointed out, in addition to discrimination in recruitments, that Roma are expelled from the labour market first because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have an average degree of study and as a result of elementary education of bad quality only an irrational number of them can reach a higher degree of study."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in promoting human rights.
Investing in Roma children's education can mean strengthening the economy of EU Member States.
According to the honourable Member it is necessary to make these links more widely known between the Roma and non-Rom.
As soon as the school starts a Roma, its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow all the more; through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary for the European Union to work together to speed up the process of school segregation and that is why proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens in full terms of the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since the meeting in Berlin last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: piety for a transitional period
At the end of October the fate of the packed Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal matters has been postponed for the moment.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in their place, the question is until pity lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem who has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the two highly criticised politicians indicated that they were not attacked with all the forces to the chair.
So they tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union obtained 60.7%, but now after the coup d'état against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coerce in any way.
As the first signal of the reorganisation within the party the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP Liberals and the Free Electors exponents values right for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their strengths to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
Meanwhile, Stoiber will also have an active role to play in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU which played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
Certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, the crisis of social democrats still lasts.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained by the burgeoning in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition collected under the name United Democratic Forces (SDO) really hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections held in circumstances discussed, "deceived" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up a boycotting previously evaluated.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered to be anti-democratic.
He referred to a distancing that the OSCE by evaluating the election campaign has put the emphasis on positive movements and not on failures, such as the prohibition to appear for one third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE's rapid Monday report, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this opposition, an improvement in the political climate can be seen: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries as independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition to the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a parliament without weight".
The opposition does not include protest actions for the results, but rather tries to get voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we must print the opposition newspapers in Russia, the distribution of local authorities raises difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the most officially aided, that of pensioners, the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Because of the indebtedness of the country and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security "remembrance of sepulcher silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Contrary to the opposition policy, the Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in fact", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on this new measure is being taken against swarves, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar at work time.
The new antifannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" the minister says.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," says Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a process shared by workers and there was the collaboration of all."
I mean, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Superior School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for public employees' illness have decreased by 50%, that is, 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile thousands of public employees have joined together to challenge the rules of Brunetta decree by acceding to the application supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today numbers about the least absenteeism at work because of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operose fannulons' are growing steadily.
In fact there are thousands of employees in Italy of the correct and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war to the illegitimate rules contained in the decree."
In particular, Tar will be opposed to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for sickness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hours of detection of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents Work, Napolitano: "Crime Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double the deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the same tragic events of these days confirm how crucial is the question of prevention at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association muted and disabled at work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "live appreciation for the ongoing association commitment to prevention at work, the protection of unlucky workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has, of course, raised an angry 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, provoke the clamoring of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repetitions in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular meaning takes on the many initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the phenomenon alive, not to slow down in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber, for his part, stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a firm commitment to end them urgently".
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is nevertheless impressive," noted the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this " downward trend" to be less careful, because it is precisely when the attention slows down that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at general level there is still too little to tackle the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But, above all, employers need a greater sense of responsibility for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the lack of assistance towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of the unfortunate should not depend on spontaneousism or enlargement from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 readers under charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement published in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging Health Risks recently identified (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - we read in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day keeping the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the EU responsible continues - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise consumers' awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concludes the EU Executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical equipment and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage can arise from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment when listening to high volume (more than 89 decibel) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sum will be taken.
This is the timetable set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas - it would point out German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time period.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of worthlessness, since its opinions will not be binding, German reply: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to do the Commission and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is to exist, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the policy crushes on day-to-day management and on the emergencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses".
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or still, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which it has absolutely needed, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future that states the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the only current municipal boundaries but will look well beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "even in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to go independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
She wrote a Miami lady on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big tough face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and don't answer the voters' question: will you be a good president? Then there's polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
In this case too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the southern parts of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth, we know well who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out on one side of the American mentality held up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you win Obama, we'll leave America.
What he never said before, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the weapon winning for the democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
He's changing America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was the weak spot of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
U.S.A., the economic footprint is also felt on journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the Internet, "killer" on the printed paper.
Fifteen hundred American journalists were asked by the Pew Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control as regards the future.
Well, today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want the traditional journalism as the general public intends to do, to be substantially reversed.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the US journalist today.
Six out of ten senior newspapermen and executives are convinced that the national newspaper is following the wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open up an internet crossing, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are warning has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that they "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some it has to do with the "safety of work".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are at 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: every day after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STANDS THE GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-contract investigation concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of his trial last week, he was discharged from the homes converted into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the realtor to travel from the city of the province to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (which the PM has given contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It confirms the New York Times of yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new, conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, by the way, that became prepotently alive by the vote I said at the beginning.
This is, however, only one example of the changes, the major changes, which the current economic earthquake may pre-announce or already let us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not here only.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time and in the new climate they solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary re-launching, of the dual category State-sovereignity in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions, which have, yes, close links with the outside world, but first of all they see very much involved in the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
Which immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems largely out of play or has little to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union that divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each State that all are expected to intervene, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you arrive at close are only the States that possess economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in sixth place.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market or international organisation can possibly have the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the constitutional-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor that is very closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now in the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to deal increasingly with those very little material things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are nevertheless bound in absolute terms to a confined space, to a territory.
So that whoever is sovereign, certainly owns several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
However, I come to the second novelty that predisposes a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who can take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species, turned out to be so inadequate and filled with shadow zones.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discreet, an insufficient, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
That is to say, it seems that in many sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far at large, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their own time and being increasingly alien to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branch but powerful movement of dellegitimacy of the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" elections or in the sudden developments of the collective moods of these last last few times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of workers' consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially disturbing to dismeasure.
In view of all this, it would be quite clear that a "mass rebellion" on the agenda would be overstated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not at all.
The superneck to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has gone very close.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American magazine Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The beginning of the glue can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged like a pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily pulls off the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the engineering faculty of the University of Dayton.
CAMMINARE SUI MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electricity current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made up of microfibres such as hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to maintain a perfect grip.
Pharmacists: never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because of the fact that they are rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or reducing their efficacy, depending on the case, with even serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, cancels the beneficial effects and endangers the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice had already ended under charge because it was held responsible for increasing up to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, ansyolitic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACI A RISCHIO - The same Italian Medicine Agency had reported it in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to be careful what you drink if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These findings are reported immediately to the various international and national drug agencies that may change the information notes of the medicines.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is anything that is not clear, do not impress us but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks on Enron, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered not a few polemics and that for years was refaced to the economist, but has now proved to be correct.
"I am surprised and also a bit shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a divulner with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of libertism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org 3.0 release, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with different news: the welcome screen and the revised and made less spartan interface, adding more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office suite 2007, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific features of some modules such as that which allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original look of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text computer.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text maker, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version is available at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd may also be shipped to the home or at work.
And if the issue of gratuity can be a way of spreading into houses, it is in business that Open Office tries the big bet, already able to count on several projects already carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there are also realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulate presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, it is finally the graphic module.
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third grade and winner of the best climber jersey.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26th year Kohl is the fourth successful runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl blood samples are among those carried out in the last weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and will meet two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epoch is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the bead shirt of better climber.
Immigrati:new YORK TIMES AND CHIEDE, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is it what we ask in a long article the New York Times that devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where we register "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation required by the League that tightens the barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of expensive rentals up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students is not in crisis.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the renting union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point where young people should be excluded from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so distorted the market to trigger a generalised increase process also for residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, with no fee limit, related sub-rents.
In the case of Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed that, through the revision of tax taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average of 800 (Lambia, Udine and Faira) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed place costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) approximately 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinematà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples it takes 300/450 euros, for a room it spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed place it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where renting to extra-Community students is most frequent, such as Perugia, there is also an additional anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested by foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, cities erase historic halls
Historical cinema halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centres but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multisales and the consequent death by constipation of monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inelutable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Disappearing are often historical places and loads of memory," it's as if there was less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions," observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that made 20 years worth to Tornatore the Oscar award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a province hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay for the major lift are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-sala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the tenderers: the government's pre-debt is around 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to run the repairs with the signing of a protocol between the Commune and Anec, the first such in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas monosala both in the historical centre and in the outskirts.
Among the rules provided are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the strain of multiplex traditional salts must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise Cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have lived many shared emotions, not to see the signs buried by the dust I turn on the other side".
Links between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Commune to the interests of the Pyromalli cosca."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria are addressed to the mayor and vice-syndicator of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by association for delinquenting mafia mold, sentenced to compensation of 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense," wrote the prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the already large possibilities of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loirero does not hide that "colossions between local authorities and organised malavities there are several of them" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'dragheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrests this morning follow those of July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Pyromalli cosca.
Since the end of April last, the council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the task of administering the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected to the head of a central-right coalition, after the May 2006 dance.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Pyromalli cosca had even come to demand the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interactions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the PMs, "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group knownly close to the Pyromalli, has emerged, harmonizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy comes from the waves now the bigs go down in the field
It is an extinct stock, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources upon which they have set their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, colossal as the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea-wave-drive exploitation plants.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Besides, there would be currents and tides.
They're on the attack.
The first betting company on marine energy was Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are becoming more and more among these companies that have always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the U.S. oil giant to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Committee, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new outbreaks.
In addition to the Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate to observers an upward interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about environmental impact.
For now installations such as Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technology must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of cattle connected to each other.
The wave push, which moves the oxen up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
Pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore via submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants in design, waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides turns the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said she has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of tides that have been like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others facing the coast, have already invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
