How long have you had these symptoms?
and always chest pain should be treated this way, especially at your age
and also fever
and your cholesterol and blood pressure should also be controlled
And he's got a fever now?
And you feel this chest pain now?
and also has difficulty breathing
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides this?
and how much you've had of fever
And I've got cough, too.
And I have a little cold and cough
and today I really have a pretty strong chest pain
and this is the right time for your pollen allergy
and comes chest pain
And I think I have a little fever.
And I want you to describe where the chest pain feels
and they're having something fever too
and with its history of diabetes
And you know, I feel like I'm being ripped off by the chest.
And you know, people cough on me all the time
and feels chest pain
and said it's a pressure in the chest
someone in the family has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
any other symptoms or problems you notice in addition to muscle pain?
Are there other sick people like you with the same symptoms in your home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Is there anything missing air?
still feels pain in the chest
because this is the flu season
but should also not be ignored by chest pain of heart origin
but now a more important problem is this chest pain
But I have difficulty breathing
But I know a lot of people cough at me.
but we must always treat chest pain with maximum seriousness
But now you're breathing well, aren't you?
for this chest pain I completely forgot
Feels like somebody smashing your chest.
still feels like a lack of air

gave me fever yesterday
I also had a little fever
tube fever yesterday
I have a deep pain here, in my chest
I also have some difficulty breathing
I'll send you an image.
Today I have a little chest pain
Today I only have a little headache and some fever
in my opinion, it's a flu
in my opinion, it's a little flu
Is it like someone very, very heavy sitting on his chest?
it all started with headache and fever at about the same time
It hurts my chest center
is a pressure like chest pain
It's on my chest.
is in the center of my chest
is in the center of the chest
pain in the chest

Accumulated incidence in rapid increase of coronary artery disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in European Union countries or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that the majority recovers.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union country or European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date, there had been 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy only.
Acquisition of the accumulated quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), case counts of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries showed upward trends in the accumulated incidence of similar COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that, by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages of countries, variations in national public health responses and, possibly, different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
By early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1% of cases, respectively (data is not shown).
However, it should be systematically collected to complement the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios related to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, conglomerates of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally care for a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The disease outbreak by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, resulting in a human catastrophe.
Similarly to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and complete analysis of the research topic, which is developed rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and invaluable memory for all Chinese people, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) which caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called conavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to almost 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients given discharge and more than 3000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress in research on this new subject that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a COV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what is so far known about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in figure 1.1, unknown pneumonia conglomerates were first reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission among humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that considered the site of origin of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak of a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 countries more than the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100 000) more than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded mainly in conglomerates in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, there were 5 days (2 to 9) between the appearance and diagnosis of the COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the period of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Party in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and wrapped viruses that contain a unique sense chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spinach glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and dipeptideil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of the nucleocapsid form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99,98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huanan seafood market of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra-delegate sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new orf3b-coded short protein and a secreted protein encoded by the orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the complete human-length ACE2 electronic chromocopy structure in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by means of civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered native to SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96 % to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bats called bats-SL-CoVZX45 and bats-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what intermediate guest helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the route of transmission remains to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-hoc mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in Chinese traditional medicine) are a possible intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference spread by the whole of two genomes remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected that provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
The SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 % ethanol, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to disable the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the immune innate system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including type C lectins receptors, Toll type receptors (TLR), NOD type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I (RLR) receptors.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill those cells infected with the virus.
Co-operative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defence cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humour immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system generates locally a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorganic failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence of conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time depending on the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be expected to transmit the virus to others.
As a usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected normally should remain quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever or symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A population study in late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory care was necessary in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and rose to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 only ranged between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a propagation capacity greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within one family or from the same meeting or vehicle, like a cruiser.
Patients usually have a travel or residence history in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have been discharged from the hospital may return to the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and the reactive C protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or bilateral glazing opacities in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR).
When ADDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Type I and Type II pneumonia dysfunction decreases surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces lung capacity to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in chest X-rays are often in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumonia, the formation of a hyalin membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitium, and multinucleated sinic cells in the lungs of a patient who died because of the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and ADDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical demonstrations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020 began to be used.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graduated rod in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other conaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of patients recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express the ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory care is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to disease severity.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance (OCEM), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokines storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokines storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorganic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 anti-receptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat the cytokines storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokine storm are the modulation of the T cell-led immune response; the blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppression of the 4 cytokine signaling pathway, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis significantly.
However, careful use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with critical COVID-19.
The effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed at the time of this analysis.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been verified.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-catenary RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
Blood extraction from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something novel.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected 10 patients who were seriously ill.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excess immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may result in fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
The MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or are imprecise, since it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from serious stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were determined to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China who used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine Treatment (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only.
What is more surprising, the worsening rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT continue to await more well-controlled tests at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of the actions and determine the effective components of the treatments of the MCT or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid insomnia, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty of the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected persons and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public as needed.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate powerful and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity to protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live viruses attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably due to SARS being extinguished 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for the MERS have been developed using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immuns is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronaviruses.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on informed clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also right for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care more likely had underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly greater than those who did not require them (at an average age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor in the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 compared to 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also join positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: Reactive C protein level (RCP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential predictive factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and forecast of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in several organs, especially the heart and the liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Using steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, since in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or cause no symptoms at the early stage of the infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected early or incubated may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, whereas transmission was mostly not in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, which includes the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have resulted in significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the descending phase will last for 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exuds in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the recently identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, there have been promising signs in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Originally it was predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened in terms of infection and may eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in stools, which suggests a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 per cent of cases were possibly caused by nosocomium infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family workers, colleagues and even transecutors in contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent fluid drops from being transmitted by the air or attached to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virons can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health care providers should use insulated suits to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite using an N95 mask; the virus may have entered your body through your inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also use transparent protective faces or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with soaps that are most commonly used, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great warning in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the Director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control reassured citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly relaxed the public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Party, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this tough lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, since every word matters to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual clinical information, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in their early stages, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 countries more than the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 % compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if there are no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which causes a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in the investigation of COVID-19, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses of bats similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, let's say, bats, humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively stop the transmission, and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while it is transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, become extinct as SARS or resurgence periodically as influenza?
While it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Human coronavirus zoonotic sources
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly it can be a human coronary virus infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronaviruses in the center of attention again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronovirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human cronovirus.
Most of the coronaviruses of humans have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
There are also known the intermediate reserve guests of some human coronaviruses.
Identifying animals has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and guests in animals could also shed important information on the pathogen of conavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of existing knowledge of the seven coronary coronaviruses of humans, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different coronaviruses of humans from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current coronary artery disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of virus development on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary RNA viruses with envelope.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, due to the form of crown they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have non-segregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spinach (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins for each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronavirus is classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four strains (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as a common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause auto-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronary virus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that took place in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today’s history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later called SARS-CoV-2, is the causing agent of the current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91,000 people as at 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven coronaviruses of humans have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force and the factors of restriction of jumping between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogeny of the human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of the coronaviruses of humans are normally not pathogens in their natural reserve guests, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new guest.
We also examine the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, where increased transmissibility often leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
It has been known about the coronaviruses of animals since the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCOV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven coronaviruses of humans have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the findings of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was later adapted to grow on WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be broadcast predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCOV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a serious lower respiratory infection.
The SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus of humans well documented in the history of humanity, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third coronavirus of humans that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases of 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and high creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytokines storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to investigate the coronaviruses of humans.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7 % of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitics in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitics acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred because of unknown causes, such as in the rarest case of a more virulent subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and to maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia have been recorded.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of SARS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also developed acute renal failure, which is currently only found with MRS among the diseases caused by human coronary virus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known.
From mid-to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and also named the disease COVID-19.
As at 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a fatality of 3,4%.
Significantly, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while out of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82 %, they are classified in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the human coronary artery disease course are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six human coronary coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between that of SARS-CoV and the four coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in coronary virus infections of humans acquired in the community, including non-specific or mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 as with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human passes, as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 performs an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in certain circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of special interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with the coronary virus of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passes, will influence the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The four coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronary coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that have developed serious diseases due to human coronaviruses have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to an extent sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the factors of the host's restriction.
In this sense, the more time the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more infected people, the more likely it will be to adapt completely to humans.
If well adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronary coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reserves and seek the opportunity to propagate themselves to potential human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronary virus of humans acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of the human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifiers of the human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve guest hosts a human coronavirus in a continuous and long-term manner.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of the human coronary virus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate guest just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and it is usually pathogen.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and fulfill the function of an amplifier guest by allowing the virus to be replicated transiently and then passed on to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
A human coronary virus can cause a terminal guest infection if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also be adapted to the intermediate guest and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the initial SARS case had contact with hunting animals.
Further studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farm-massed palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets would only act as an amplifier intermediate guest, but not as a natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities for several species of small mammals to also act as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifier guests cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Back searches of SARS-CoV's natural animal guest revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, known as Rhinolophus bat-related Rhinolophus bat CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese shear bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92 % with SARS-CoV.
These studies have based on the new concept that bats house emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
Human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, the serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reserve guest of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is classified in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host, dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase sequences phylogenetically approach their beta-coronavirus counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you cannot find a MERS-CoV alive in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87 %.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reserve guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the exuded nasal dromedaries, which further supports that camels act as guests of the EMS-CoV bonde reservoir.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms were generally observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only by breathing, but also by fecal-oral, which is also the main pathway of virus spread of bats.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a nucleotide homology of 96,2 % with a bat crownvirus, RaTG13, isolated from bats Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to assign a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of virtually identical bats.
Presumably, the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92 % with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RatG13, with an identity of about 90 % at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two subline viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97,4 %.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RatG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral counts in lung samples, which result to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that included about 86.3% of the complete length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the difference in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline-related betacoronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangoline betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals should still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the pandolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the BDRs of the pangoline betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal defends a combination of pangoline betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended among betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may have originated from bat kronaviruses, while the parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches mountains) detected in a tricolor bat in North America had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another coronavirus of bats, known as Hipposiders/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of chamelees as intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge that is so far obtained from the animal origins of known human coronary viruses is summarized in Figures 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species until it infected humans from livestock in 1890, there was a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of transmission between HCoV-229E species is not known with such accuracy.
Alcoronaviruses of bats have been found closely related to HCOV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alphacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-related alphacoronaviruses related to HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca-coronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no alpac alfacoronavirus has been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that alpacs acquire human-related alphacoronavirus.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogen viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronavirus acts as a genetic collection of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests that transmit viruses to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a widespread collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great flying capacity are all favourable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may be a terminal guest of beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as is the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reserve guest of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the coal slaughter or mining.
Second, the pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-catenary RNA viruses, the estimated coronary artery mutation rates could be considered "moderated" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, by site 2, depending on the coronary coronavirus adaptation phase to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease of reading check, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotide analogue rembesivir suppresses the replication of the coronary artery by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the guest.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that he has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their efficacy quickly.
Second, the long-coronavirus RNA genome exercises additional plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of co-evolution between species, which leads to the emergence of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the uniquely copious open-reading frameworks and the functions of encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently templates during RNA replication using a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest who acts as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during transcription of coronavirus RNA.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could be combined to generate new coronaviruses.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-housing interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis of isolated human-civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adapting to different guests, particularly with mutations in the S protein RBD.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the response of the host's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its receptacles for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, bat, mouse and dog mapache, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from isolated strains of human and cyveta viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spig protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 unit implies that the affinity of protein S with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater of this union compared with that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCOV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidasa N in HCOV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylate in HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses into humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reserve guests of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must use the factors of dependence of the host and subvert the factors of restriction of the host for successful transmission between species.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction of the host virus should still be identified and characterized.
A full genome objective investigation of the patient's dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronavirus appearance: we start from scratch
The diversity of coronaviruses of bats provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new cronaviruses of humans.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination, also boost the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoder genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the adjunct proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered to be important in adapting to humans, as bat virus related to SARS-CoV has been isolated, but it has been determined that different ORF8 proteins are codified.
There was a elimination of 29 nucleotide characteristic of SARS-CoV in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinations locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are recombined with other coronaviruses of animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which is more likely to result in the release of viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E due to a elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in bat- and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame change.
Finally, although not less important, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure in their reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
The bats seem to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of proinflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the natural killer cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the exorribonuclease reading check, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation to the host.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new coronaviruses of humans have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reserve guests, such as bats and camels.
They are vigorously replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
These include the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and to the cytokines storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe is pulmonary damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response delinking strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflammation NLRP3 in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of inflammation NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line leading to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While it has been determined that street animals and other animals in the markets have viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangoline betacoronavirus has been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that the pangoline betacoronavirus could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
The coronavirus has recovered protagonists due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human conaviruses in human transmission.
Wide evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing the cyvets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, the pangolines should withdraw from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lines of pangoline betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be diluted in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with the markets for wild animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in wild state.
In particular, coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity to propagate is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate guest, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will illuminate the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) triggered an outbreak, which is now officially known as the cronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called cronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guideline that was published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on his clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be met if there are no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and adjacent areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and adjacent areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal lymphocyte count, decreased or reduced at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristic of pathogen or serological tests as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequence showing high homogeneity to the recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or increased title ≥ 4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is increasing evidence that we should be careful with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also occur in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will arise and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend looking for and complying with the latest guidelines in their countries of origin.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday due to COVID-19 in one day.
It is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IDRC) reported that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was attending Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Transport Minister for Roads and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally scheduled until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had started on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men who returned from Italy and one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infections and Zambia had its first coronary virus-related death.
North Korea stated on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronary virus infections.
Last day, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800) of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary virus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to earn their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes to 10, with one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of La Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their hygienic paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied out of fear of COVID-19 if people were to self-injection.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a package on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery," and said that the demand "had no precedent", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a voice from Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer of Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult for them to do so.
It foresees an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that the toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a wide empty space in the shelves, thereby intensifying the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article in the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy themselves] and have large amounts, they would probably minimize the panic, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the toilet paper Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder in Melbourne auctions, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page board designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The supermarkets at first were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including mascarillas, disinfectants, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandamia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of propagation and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has no precedent".
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to the influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic status emerges following the decision of WHO in January to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126 000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The coronary artery pandemic 2019–20 is an ongoing coronary artery disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and approximately 97 000 deaths as a result.
About 364 000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the case fatality rate is 4 per cent in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms, usually, is about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing mouth covering, keeping distance from other people and controlling and self-insulation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, hazard controls at the workplace and closures of facilities.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic alteration, delaying or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Bad information on the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant cases of virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures of the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, the coronaviruses of the pangolines and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to manifest symptoms was ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group of the wet market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person in Hubei province, could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to the reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's main scientific adviser, felt that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of persons who underwent COVID-19 tests, and who obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had carried out tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies to avoid testing in people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most frequent 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80% of deaths were people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who died positive in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much greater, as it may not include people who died without the evidence, for example, in their homes, in elderly households, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official registration of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of deaths declared] is underestimation", a statement corroborated by the United States sub-accounting anecdotic reports. This sub-estimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators were generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate on cases is 6.0 per cent (97.039/617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died because of a disease, and the fatality rate for infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died because of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified time limit and consider a specific population from the infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the rate of fatality for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the case fatality rate.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infectious outbreaks, if they are not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without guests available.
But at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
China's Government's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow WHO's recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, expressed that the SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical separation and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt expressed, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted so easily, would disappear completely" and "can become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of recurrence would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, production of spit in the respiratory tract (flame), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemopsis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in waking up and bluishing in the face or lips; in view of the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The further progress of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, have no clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore, researchers advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more often than 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, drops can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods of time, which can be generated when talking. Respiratory drops can also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are close or possibly inhale to the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also be propagated when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then the eyes, nose or mouth are touched.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation may be possible before symptoms and at more advanced stages of the disease occur.
People obtained positive results in the disease tests up to three days before symptoms occur, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few asymptomatic case reports confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not fully clear how easy the disease is to spread, usually one person infects another two or three. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed to pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that might have touched infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when contacting soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronary coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgeneral sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from bats.
At the level of the full genome, it is 96 % identical to other samples of bat crownvirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangoline viruses and those of humans.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of the pangolines and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pangolines are the intermediate guest.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed by the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, though less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computed tomography as a detection method or as a front-line test to diagnose the COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first to be published on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hisopus, although one can also use a hisop for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them proved to be sufficiently accurate to approve its widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of computed X-rays and tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric illustrated glass opacityes and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis by unconfirmed images by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study carried out in China compared the results of chest computed tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that, although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, both with X-rays and with computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical separation measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that healthcare providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement requiring limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. Wrong ideas are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwashing gargas are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Washing of hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDCs recommend that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when contacting soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDCs also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% of alcohol in volume when there is no water and soap.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after disinfectant exposure on a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5 % and iodine at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or a daycare facility, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cash machines that have been used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with the flexed elbow or with a disposable handkerchief for coughing or sneezing, and that they discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who might be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance traveled by the respiratory droplets that are dispersed while talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without a proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made with fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people manufacture cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited leaving public spaces without using a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask when they are in public spaces to protect themselves and protect others.
The Government of Austria demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded the use of masks by passengers on trains and buses in the long run.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures for the control of infection designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement methods of social distance by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distance themselves from others.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a greater risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and the CDCs recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, instead of encouraging them to keep in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations that only have sexual relations with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation was recommended at home for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
The health agencies have published detailed self-insulation instructions, and many Governments have demanded or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter instructions on self-quarantine were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with a generalised transmission are advised to do self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events of mass attendance; community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its seriousness was evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented massive detection assessments and forty-ones located, and issued warnings on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to make quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and deaths to half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), since otherwise the transmission is reactivated quickly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing existing medicines.
Taking free sales drugs for cooling, drinking liquids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory care may be required.
Using steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental response to outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for primary medical hospitals and services for redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and insulating positive patients at COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of breathers and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case may have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to Huanan's wholesaler seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed that Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge of at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of unknown cause pneumonia had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan as to initiate an investigation. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration through the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Following official data show that, as at 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As at 26 March, the United States has exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported around the world; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as home orders, refugee orders in place or confinement) and curfews. As of 2 April, around 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, comply with some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined to South Africa and 13 billion people are confined to India.
As at 26 March, 17 billion people around the world were carrying out some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about the third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and her hospital informed the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan for "difting rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission among humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the biggest quarantine in the history of humanity", on January 23, a health cord was announced banning travel inside and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected some 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Celebrations of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities into Wuhan, as convention and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19, which included the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of the holiday of the Spring Day.
Universities and schools were also closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. After the beginning of the world stage of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, only one case had been transmitted at national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei and Wuhan were made more flexible, two months after confinement had been imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended as of 28 March, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China should apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese Government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will start with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00, coincident with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their online respect for physical distance in order to avoid the recurrence of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases remained quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive to the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best-organized programme for testing the virus in the population and insulating infected people, as well as identifying and quarantineing those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centers for virus detection tests with results available the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in whole cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand that Moon be removed for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad should remain in quarantine for two weeks.

Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has destined five billion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a post-China virus propagation center.
In the midst of statements of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissidents, as well as temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a higher risk of virus spread in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak.
As at 17 March, at least 12 expolitics or politicians in Iranian exercise had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than those reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak was confirmed to Italy, when two Chinese tourists were positive in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree containing the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sports events in these areas has already been ordered." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the A Series football matches, were to be held at closed doors until April, but, on 9 March, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.

As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and most of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy with a large elderly population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK response to the virus first arose as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places like bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distance measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted trips and outdoor activities to those who were considered strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersion of meetings.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese secretism authorities were accused of preventing prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over New Moon Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, while "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission among human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak of a public health emergency of international importance (SPII), the sixth ESPII since the first time the measure was invoked during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that needlessly interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO made use of the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency of supporting those countries "who do not have systems to detect those who contracted the virus, if any."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “power of the entire United Nations system in the response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, enabling coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the social, economic and development implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was launched with China to provide international experts and WHO on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with main institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county level, including urban and rural environments." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronary coronavirus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still very early to call it a pandemic, countries should nevertheless be "in a phase of preparation".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that global coronary virus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus can be on the way and we must be ready," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that current data did not ensure that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that this statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned about both the alarming levels of propagation and severity, as well as the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received important criticisms as to why it is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group noted that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, detained persons, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of governmental support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by the COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronary virus challenge.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom Office, Michael Gove, and the son of President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators were fired at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) due to its management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the start of the coronary virus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of the COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The U.S. Donald Trump administration has referred to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and stated that "China's censorship overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, pointed out by some critics as racism and "detraction of its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a strategy for apparently originating communications on the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All About China".
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television apparitions. "Media such as Policy, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for world influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to raise its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent assistance to these last two countries.
On 3 April, US sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 mascarillas to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
And mascars-related disputes have been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of breathers destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking an "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment cover momentum, they may also correspond if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it threatens not only the lives of the United States troops and the different European countries participating, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders for help, saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and punish those who are considered to have broadcast false information on the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
The outbreak of coronavirus in several cases of supply shortages was blamed as a result of the increased use of equipment at the global level to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factories.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand of consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several locations also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
The technological sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas was affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the illicit accumulation and trade of essential products have been successful and have avoided an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while the Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a newspaper report of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts felt that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could overcome those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been "removed" after a strong drop in oil prices due to China's lowest demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several U.S. stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest fall in one day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with reductions of more than 10 %.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but held a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many feel that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
Consequently, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached a level never before seen.
Several train stations and transhipment terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important season of travel related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions independently, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Moon Year have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the places of work not to be reopened to that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in hours of care or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a fall of 50 to 60 percent.
This also resulted in a drop of 33 to 43% in pedestrian transit to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Operators from shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as more hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America who had been left without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were swept away in their homes in interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Bank of the San Luis Federal Reserve. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. About 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they began confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Culture and arts organizations tried to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of its employees and the public and support to artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, around the world and in various degrees, museums, libraries, shows and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated rate of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian penance of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live transmission via the Internet or television, while others offer places to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the Plaza de San Pedro empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents into sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most important sporting events were cancelled or postponed, among them, the UEFA 2019–20 Champions League, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the NHL season 2019–20.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming sites around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or canceled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, like Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festives" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
On-line, numerous Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside.
Following the progress of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe that experienced a serious outbreak of the COVID-19, could also be suspected and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at first signed requests to prevent Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacs from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from north-east India, who share a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, were harassed in relation to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengala, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
China's Consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism were increased towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign rubbish" and destined for "disposal".
Many newspapers with payment walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the available outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-printers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were major variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting mortality rates by reported cases, which are likely to be very overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or spit samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In those infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by means of suction catheters, or the material that is ejected when coughing (sput) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase (rRT-PCR) chain reaction, and was the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of clinical polymerase (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
Search for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronaviruses and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing its diagnostic chain reaction panel of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase for the new crownvirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One out of three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a blockade in conducting tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were processed satisfactorily throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only from then on was allowed for state and local laboratories to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. The US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the COVID-19 test based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided national evidence for COVID-19.
No limits were announced in the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the FDA emergency authorisation for a test which takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to carry out 50 000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the protein of the new coronavirus nucleocapsid (N protein) with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid influenza test.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur."
Typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in illustrated glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, pattern in stone and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where polymerase chain reaction was compared to computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, though less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDCs recommend polymerase chain reaction as an initial test.
Part of the reaction of the immune system to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately from 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and surveillance of the population. Analysis can be carried out in central laboratories or through tests at the attention point.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories may perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although serial specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided the agency with notification as appropriate and therefore can now distribute its antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody testing kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube," the patient spits on the tube, sends it and gets a result soon. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspected cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In tests in drive-through centers for the VOCID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes the samples with the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the week before.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity to make 160 000 tests per week.
As of March 19, testing was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, during the 12/2020 calendar week, at least 483,295 samples had been analysed in total, up to and including the 12/2020 week, and 33,491 samples (6.9 %) showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only making more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, Wuhan, the BGI opened an improvised 2000 square metre emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese:  a, or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to cope with quarantine had doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As at 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reagents affected massive tests in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more evidence of coronary virus per person in its population than any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI population level (which was based on its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the ability to perform tens of thousands of chain reaction tests of polymerase with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas have been developed that address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that sent low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea evidence helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government has achieved its capacity to carry out tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, over a number of years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes such as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in the U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hisopates and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "deficit"; the government then eliminated bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits to Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained imprecise results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would withdraw the kits that dropped incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought to China were incorrect. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the proof kits that Turkey bought China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them in use". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million testing kits to China, but in early April 2020 he announced that they were not serving.
The conduct of tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contact who had positive results in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death by COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from outside, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but that did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the 23rd of March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to perform tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as % of evidence that a country carrying out tests in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are equal.
Washing hands, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as common influenza or cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If there is no water or soap, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing its hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who used the bathroom.
After the nose ring, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food or animal waste.
Medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can generate small improvements in height growth for children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand-washing can reduce diarrhea episodes in approximately a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand-washing with soap. Soap hand-washing is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and is charged with the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Joint diarrhea and pneumonia account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting soap-washing before eating and after using the bathroom in a root habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths by diarrhea and a quarter of deaths by acute respiratory infections.
Generally, hand-washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of handwashing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause skin disease that causes itching and causes the skin to become squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too common handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (CTO).
There are five critical moments during the day when the washing of hands with soap is important to reduce the oral-feal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (rining, defecating), after cleaning the tail of a child (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a correct hand-washing technique should be practised to prevent disease transmission include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand-washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hand-washing with soap. A study carried out in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent; the United States was about half with 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate with 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviour, to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. The washing of hands in groups of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand-washing into child behavior.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote the health and education of children.
Disperse twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms improves when adding soap or detergent to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, the CDC states that "liquid soap is preferable with dispensation controls that do not involve using hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted for a health conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics are used to preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as it is promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent and protecting the skin, the sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the hands.
The pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to eliminate the bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to eliminate natural oils that hold land and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on the reduction of microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, the water-free and alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (also known as the solution for alcohol-based hands to rub, antiseptic solution for hands to rub or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
The majority is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thick agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol resecure.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases even more antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to rub eliminate bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70 % alcohol remove 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) from bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) from bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Enough solution should be used for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands to rub, such as to wet or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel sequences.
The fingertips should also be washed well, rubbed in both palms. The Centers for Control and Disease Prevention of the United States recommend hand washing before the hands disinfectants to rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for adequate hand washing unless there is no water or soap.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may dry the skin, unless emolient or moisturizing the skin is added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol dryness can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing disinfectants caused considerable less irritation and dryness of the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in broaching alcohol-based solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause contact irritant dermatitis was attractive compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens continue to remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much lower than alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rub.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land instead.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while water temperature apparently does not make any difference.
Shake your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Constrain for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps remove the germs from the skin, and restrict for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Swim well with running water.
Washing in a container can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are again contaminated more easily. The most frequently forgotten parts are thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under nails
Artificial nails and enamel of peeled nails can house microorganisms.
Wet lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand-washing when there is no running water or soap, for example, to pour water from a hanging tank or pumpkin with appropriate holes or to use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home cranes" and other economic options.
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a sieve and a lever driven with the foot to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap in a bar.
Effective hand-drying is an essential part of the hand-hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the association of the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased, on average, 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria by 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air dryer propagated microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand-drying.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after hand-drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand disinfectant wipers is an alternative during trips, when there is no water or soap.
The alcohol-based disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The hands-washing of doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital environment.
Electronic devices provide feedback to remind hospital staff that they wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
Washing the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be narrowed together by intertwining their fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a pig brush to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogen microorganisms ("germens") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand-washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of catheter-related infections in the bloodstream by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing hand-washing and the friction of standard hands in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's manual for hand hygiene can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the hygiene of the hands if the regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand-washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
after treating patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (a "medicine" or "antibacterial" soaps) confers the possibility of elimination to the handwashing agent.
This may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. In order to wash your hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush for rubbing and another sterilized instrument for cleaning under the nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires the hands and forearms to be washed to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When wetting, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand-cleaning is at the first 20 % of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. By comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the alcohol-flotate decreased by 26% more the contamination of bacteria than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and Clostridium spores difficult in the hands than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health-care environments.
In developing countries, soap-washing is considered to be an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviours.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few taps to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can also be the result of entrenched habits rather than the lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-washing can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to a change in behaviour in the long-term population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective to increase hand-washing in the PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns for hand-washing that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has driven the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand-washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting soap-washing is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health-care-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right hand-washing techniques" alongside the washrooms of the public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take over something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in Matthew’s Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much wider phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary spot, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more elements for hand-washing.
In addition, those people who have allowed to wash their hands after such reflection, are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as baaism, Hinduism, tevilism and the netilate yadayim in Judaism, the washing of the lavatory in Christianity and the Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force themselves to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to be washed before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace at COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace at COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the job and are based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Administration of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal working contact with the public and fellow workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand-washing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene rules and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of average exposure includes those where frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected by existing Community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protective equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protective equipment suitable for work activity.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are ill, because they have to take care of others or because they are afraid of the possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are required and the means of purchasing such goods (such as buying in hours other than peaks, by means of home shipping or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases may be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Plans to prepare and respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to a outbreak include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting persons at greater risk of adverse health complications, maintaining trade operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrations and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment should be selected depending on the hazard for the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. the respirators), used appropriately and systematically, reviewed frequently, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and deleted, cleaned and stored or disposed properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work with lower risk of exposure has minimal working contact with the public and colleagues.
The measures to prevent basic infections recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, the rules of respiratory hygiene that include coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper cloths and containers for wastes, the preparation for teleworking or shifting if necessary, the deterrence of workers from using foreign tools and equipment and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that disease licensing policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick relative; and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at risk of average exposure includes those requiring frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1,8 m) with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with a generalised transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail sales environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher-risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers and placement of a window for the care service so that the customer can request from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the higher-risk groups include recommending workers with home-to-home risk cards, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up shift shifts, suspending travel that are not essential to existing COVID-19 sites, developing emergency media plans that include an individual protection forum, providing up-to-date training and training to workers on the possible washrooms, setting up stopovers and personnel who are not essential to the existing COVID-19, enabling workers to be able to use the workplace to provide protection of the workers with an emergency media.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person is ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper cloths when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch possibly contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing travel by disease, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal thing is that medical control is done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and child care centres, the CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or chorus education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, stepping into and leaving hours, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered extending the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out routine daily activities, the CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are advised to contact persons who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with a household cleaning aerosol or towels before using them again and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health workers and morgues are within high or very high exposure categories.
Among the high risk exposure studies are those of the delivery workers, support, laboratory and medical transport who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure work if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue exposure works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; they become at a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19, even when they are performed aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be suitable in some medical care and morgues environments.
The samples should be handled using Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working at a distance of up to 6 feet of patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with NIOSH or higher approved filter masks in the context of an integral written respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of incoming patients.
For those taking respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, they are given attention or transported without performing aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, coat and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask must be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limitation of the entry permit to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

Subject: [Covid-19] To lighten the load and prepare for the future
DATE/HOUR OF SEND: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The epidemic of the COVID-19 highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents have no precedent, but we know that our best response lies in the overall Community empathy, cooperation and construction that form the core of this organization.
The friendliness and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible are the people we are lucky enough to work with.
I could not feel any greater gratitude and pride for all of you being my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our peers receive their payment or keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our timelines
As mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization right now.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great benefit to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether it has to take care of its loved ones, make purchases or go to the doctor, our priority is their well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
There is no need to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team to review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan of T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure the management is aware of your situation).
People who work an hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and fellow employees who work for the hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is your personal care.
What we ask you to do is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
Site Trust Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reduced speed today won't harm us tomorrow.
We didn't plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic ended.
It will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To fit our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that assigns more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule during the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning and pressure burdens throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform the delegates and the teams of the next steps we have only one confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifts going to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members at DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office transferred its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the common guidelines with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely since before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Define the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use welfare reimbursement for refreshments.
Join channel #remotes in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The RR. HH. Operations Team is analysing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all beneficiaries of Community subsidies to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could prevent the fulfilment of their share of the agreed activities for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be partly saddened by the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both in Wikimedia and others.
Thereafter, CRT will be working to establish a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep contact with COVID-19
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, coordinated universal time/07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're together on this and we're available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 at Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff resident in countries that are being heavily affected at present.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you may need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of International Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, it is a recognition that at this time our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and, possibly, in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need to take care of ourselves and take care of your families so that they can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leaderazgo team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (AEC) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic diaana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain carrying the renal amino acids of collectin.
ECA2 is a type I unipase membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is split off the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released in the blood stream and ultimately excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells of the lungs, thin intestine enterocytes, venous arterial and endothelial cells and smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
The MARN expression of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striated body, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The ACE secretes the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 secretes carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also cause several other peptides, including [de-Arg9]-bradiquinin, apiline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes of the carrier of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main point of entry for some coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spiga protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However, a number of professional associations and regulatory entities have recommended continuing the standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in lettuces with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipopolisacharids.
The average life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SA inhibitors) or circulating angiotensin II-high disease. Infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to admit these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open-source application and will be handed over to the government. In Northern Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the application of contact tracking was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetric application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, has exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add cronavirus related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
The privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of massive surveillance through the coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the cronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué to require limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the expansion of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
safety and anonymity should be protected and evidence of this protection should be provided;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens should be established to respond to such abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published lists of controls.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems when no longer needed.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present potential significant privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercom (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made information about the location available to the public, which is allowed due to the wide-ranging changes in the privacy of information laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The tracking of privacy-protected contacts is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of one user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralised and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TNC, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never exits the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location data or intersection of routes to track the spread of the COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Apps out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of joint groups around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global NCT Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for comprehensive adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that they claimed would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published specifications for the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance problems by first distributing the system through updates of the operating system and then withdrawing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma infusion of convalescent. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important diana proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-like protease, RNA-led polymerase, helicase, protein S and ribofosfatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized according to one US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctor said they use the drug when "there's no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen showed negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipyravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug to Japan for its reservations and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to Trump's Administration on drug purchase. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
Drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticisms have emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple phylovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus, and coronary virus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may result in more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with a more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is under way and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin to reduce inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registering 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who are breast-feeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on their use.
On April 14, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receiver): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, triggering significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, implementation on a scale and overall access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the dianas of the main platforms that moved to phase I security studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are at the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (it is assumed to be being planned or developed).
A phase I or phase II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, which are usually random, placebo-controlled and performed on several sites, while at the same time determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active developing vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet under human assessment (continued in "preclinical" research).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-rolling an oral vaccine with her biotech partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in treatment with neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine had been completed and that the tests were starting.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "in 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring Spring, both west of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that he had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a clinical trial in phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although progressing quickly, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported on the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'great amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against the COVID-19", before which the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to develop a joint RNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical tests and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in an anti-COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, bringing the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists began animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers from the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a RNA vaccine with self-replication against the COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese sequence.
By the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical measures research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronary artery outbreak occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School announced the PittCoVacc tests, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the vaccines of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from the specific antibodies of the antigens (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at Waterloo University announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three US universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomised trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines currently being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with animal models specific to COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, reveal the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for handling live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARA which has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARG was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing SARAG research could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, a vaccine against SROM (DNA based) completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovir vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in the social media promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various publications in social media refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the coronavirus of SARG.
b'The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress in viral pneumonia and multiorganic failure.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through drops that occur while coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, rather than being contagious in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal drip and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented oppression in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic patients is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both spit and saliva can have large viral loads.
Talking out loud releases more drops than when talking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth at cough can make droplets travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside the dormitory of people gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through stools, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not fully clear how easy it is to spread, one person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after initiation of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as its protective bubble returns. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, due to the virus entering host cells through the angiotensin I converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in serious disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may be related to receptor ECA2 in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In the autopsies of people who died by IOCID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells that express ECA2 of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, it was observed that the T-lymph-secretory lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens correlate with the recruitment of IL-6-secretary monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of the respiratory tract obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or spit hisopate can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two samples of blood must be taken with two weeks difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories in the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As at 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but they were not widely used.
Experience in China with evidence has shown that accuracy is only from 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glazing opacityes with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, a pattern in a disordered footing (septal lobulillar thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of the COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritics, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudes.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffused intravascular coagulation (CID); leukeroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDCs recommend covering their mouth and nose with a torso or sneezing handkerchief and, if they do not have cloths, use the inner part of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of cloth caps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "arrange the curve".
CDCs also recommend hand washing frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, in particular after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after the nose, cough or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis."
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Support care is provided to patients, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those who suspect they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and food have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paremamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care environments when there are procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals care for people with COVID-19 put the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipments are EPP coat, mask, protective lockers and medical gloves. When available, the respirators are preferred (instead of the masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised their use by means of an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but are not guaranteed effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When no masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most of the cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of the cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow or positive bipression nasal cannula on the respiratory pathways.
It is still not known whether any of these two provide the same benefit to people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases occur mainly in adults over 60 years of age and in particular those over 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support from ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDR) and oxygenation is becoming more difficult.
Respirators with different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax are minimized.
The oldest respirators may not count on high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are under advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in tests of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to the convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at risk and at immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to prove whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confidence, but also alerts local health officers. The analysis of the macro-data of cellular information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data on mobile phones of people suspected of having coronary viruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data on telephone location with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine failures.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile telephone operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people continue to travel."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the propagation of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may follow a slight evolution with few or no symptoms, thus it will look like other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARG virus and SROM, but the COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In cases of more severeness, COVID-19 can rapidly advance to the water difficulty syndrome (SDR) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorganic failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting and cardiac, renal and liver damage.
The change in coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal function alteration is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, there was an average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the male mortality rate was 2.8% and among women it was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Cytopathological viral changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data of the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had a pre-existing condition, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality due to disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient count of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. They worry about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30 per cent decrease in lung capacity in some individuals who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ involvement.
This can also cause post intensive care syndrome after recovery.
By March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in those recovering from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronary coronaviruses, but cases recovered from the COVID-19 have been reported which were later positive in coronary coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection rather than a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to transmission among humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of the onset of symptoms as of 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency IEC-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate is 6.9 % (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate in diagnosed patients (CFRs), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people dying of a disease, and the lethality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die of a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger, so there was a relatively low mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004% of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for males is for those who are in their 50s, and the gap between males and women is only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lowest number of women smoking and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age, could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track gender information in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and have more potential for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 on the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations under name to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use coronavirus to refer both to the disease and to the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "croonavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasal hisopos and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it within the required time, a local emerging company did reverse engineering and printed the necessary 100 valves during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of the COVID-19, there were theories of conspiracy, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that rapidly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the " SOLIDARID" test to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds on efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus to get into the receiving ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNAs, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a four-volunteer vaccine in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the virus genetic code that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for developing vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
By April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven studies evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The readapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and reporting by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was under way in April 2020. Several antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19, including: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, were evaluated in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is evidence of an attempt on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquina, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation of use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of the treating physicians of patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial S protein barley that performs type 2 transmembrane serin-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The Chinese National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after the completion of a small study.
It is in a non-randomized national phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with an analysis of serum ferritin blood to identify cytokine releases, you counteract these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleucin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine-resistant steroid-induced syndrome, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from COVID-19 is being investigated to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with non-concluding results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of serum convalescent, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
