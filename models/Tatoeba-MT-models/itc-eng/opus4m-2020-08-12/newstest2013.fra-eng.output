A republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws that made the registration or voting process more difficult from 2009 onwards.
This phenomenon increased after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the year 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo identity card and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to vote as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens who have a legal record from their voting rights.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identity card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, have no identity cards with photos issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identity card with pictures.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more from the Republican side to use to vote cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on election day in eight States.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to record approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped the enrolment rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other States aimed at reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while they represented only 13% of the voters in the state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws calling for the presentation of a photo identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make exercising the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democrat criticisms denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on and see an obvious objective of influencing results in key states in 2012.
A report by the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the States that adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Testing prostate cancer: passing the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes show wrong results, with false negative or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men already reluctant to pass testing tests even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it was difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded a mortality difference between patients who have had a screening and those who have not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of metastases if not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are painless.
It is really necessary to make patients understand the degree of risk of their cancer, by offering them the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead, in such cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to exercise active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are determined to determine who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to assess the per and against the APS test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one no longer smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a big deal of damage to people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," the spokesperson André Beaulieu lamented.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Embond and obesity also promote the occurrence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagealgia, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of a colorectal cancer.
Carcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salaison may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," he said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for now.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family background with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs boson decorated
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created an entire emo, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without any doubt that we hold a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's just assume that this is the Higgs, because chances of cheating look thin, and let's see what this is about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally indisputable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantetic state" - this "state" consists largely in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other one they're talking about boons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, in fact) The Particle Adventure, of Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the boson of Higgs would in some way resemble.
These bosons, you have to point out here, they're not all as exotic beasts as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary vanity: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messer" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a little like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbation" there is an electromagnetic wave (from light, or from infrared, or from ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the boons "force carriers".
More stable field
The same goes with the Higgs boson, to this close difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could lift the surface.
That is why we need a huge accelerator of particles such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never be on their own on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the others (like photon, yours) do not have one.
Now, what can "can do" all these research, does Mrs. Plamondon ask?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to search for any gap between observations and predictions of the MS.
In fact, there are several people who wish to find it, because the least difference could open a door on a "physical new" and block some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (ops!) or the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde's daily life is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Consider: At the beginning of the 1960 ’ s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told fire by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, at first the laser was seen rather as a "Labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it wasn't his original intention at all, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course it doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this vital area.
Duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was kidneying him had left him a two-year period.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-figue half-Rasin, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived on the eve.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Set in front of a tasty lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, re-designed.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers around him, brings his medication, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this.
"During our life, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept the regression," he says.
For, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them is no longer providing "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and choked " .
But the illness made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
However, in the coming days, she is waiting for one last visit of her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we provide, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At the time of death, we will agree to provide mouth care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily routine.
Last night, we served a beer at Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, care director.
At Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow, but they don't look like it.
Along with a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-caught in his pillows while he is torn in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the final stage of his life, whether at home, in hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montréal household palliative care company, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec health care that has caused several doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that includes euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed with summits of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are fond of their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helene Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was done!
No powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Société de care palliatives à domicile du Grand Montréal, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of their life, physicians often use palliative sedation, which comes back to sleep until the patient dies, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
More and more, the unsolved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," which means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and Italian Mafia specialists relate day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
A " industry " which cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been shaking since we took the big ways," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, a member of parliament in Quebec and former Chief of Police of Montreal.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation of the misdeeds related to road work contracts in Quebec, to which the then liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had only consented to retreats.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden party funding and corruption of officials.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he pointed out that the only Department of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some saying their instincts to reach a share share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also strives with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
The more the "Marteau Scout" police officers who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "Water Cartel" to put the pedal soft on the swellings of contracts...
Over the past few weeks, she has been conducting a series of searches and charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has robbed wine pots for repetition in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally accused of engineers on the outskirts of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambico.
The latter made a feeling by explaining to the committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid over the years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary related to the Mafia who was investing money in Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Zambim sowed in all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially Liberals then in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal collection of funds for the former Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Drain contracts whose costs were inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked roundly.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and winepots totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts of which he inflated costs.
Other road officials have confessed to having the leg fattened by inflating 30% to 40% of the invoices, through false extras.
Then an organizer of the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a side budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rolleau was one of the first elected Montreal to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rose from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "shoots on a thread to understand the system's functioning, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the faults."
The process, she says, is "sorry but positive."
We're cleaning up the wound, but we need a separate investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, so we can't get back to the doubtful practices.
Like we do the housekeeping.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "public servants stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elevated to the knowledge of the stratagem", when they did not stumble in the magouille!
Estimateing 70% of the share of dirty money in funding election campaigns in Quebec, he ironic: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but this will not change the donation, according to it: "As long as we do not limit electoral spending strictly, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete revision of the system of granting public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go any further; go to the bottom, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you've taken a new size with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress next to them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements lead me to my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings to the Clairefontaine INF pre-formation center to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by steps.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face up and provide as much as possible.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He's shouldered by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries then.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our place as a leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive during the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a great European short-term club?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in time.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In Ligue 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to take this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the skills to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting too long for the PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot of ourselves in the light of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 home against Troyes and you find things to blame on us again, it's certain that it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the League champions that we could answer here.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been qualified for the 8th final since two seasons, they've also made huge expenses!
In view of the amount invested, you were imagined with 15 points in advance of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have the smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
The GSP seems to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
So much better than saying there's a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and that he sets a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves he's the star of League One.
He showed wherever he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This moves others to hiss their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from scratching the game time.
I've seen things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good selection games.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
The lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good null (1-1) torn out, on 16 October, in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone's been fighting for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a similar match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Unlike current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is evident: the conviction that the current monetary system, which is made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credit", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the swapped bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file-haaching phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "getting" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it's the right one.
The transaction was then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, to cheat, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphanage because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 millionth, leaving the margin...
The challenge is also identified at each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on money-laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia refuse such gifts.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giant soldiers were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a textbook on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be necessary, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Trucks and armored convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferant on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
Their control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They moved to businessmen, taking advantage of government land to resell them to build up refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracting contracts.
Most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to benefit from American broads: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls as well as boys.
Work will need to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are holding cell phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that command her be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the position of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and well before.
No industry has been restored, no dam is in repair, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to get along with it.
Without energy to treat iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will need to be re-established on a regular basis.
The departure of French combatting troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many collective interest work and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local work, helped contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural areas.
What will we remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to get rid of the insurrection by foreign groups, what farmers have told me to wish for, they should maintain a small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its totality.
Taking everyone short, he announced, Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this House two additional months to complete its work.
For the next two years, Egypt has been based on a provisional text, which has repeatedly amended what weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delight", continuing to "believe his word" and "pitinate the right".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way of bringing an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to believe that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, this use of a hasty vote is based on the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text or I retain full powers", which is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, largely Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, considering that they could not make their views known.
The same had been done by representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 replacement members were added early yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
In fact, commentators have enjoyed the fact that one of the day's differences has been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee estimate that the constituent's pendulum was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Charia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals respond, who see only one blow of communication.
For according to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives the University Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "people called to decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see here the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also triggered by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Temper Alexis Bluuet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used use religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law, ndlr].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very critical because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious issue: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence Budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than trials of civilians will be prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
Blasphemy crime is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no articles are no longer relevant to the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will be shown to them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of sauna await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has retained five major reasons for your return to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourselves inevitable: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal backgrounds" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers walk through the Rue de la Souffrance or the way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the Ontion and the burial.
This is where the Christian centre of the world is located, symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.E.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then exhausted.
Travel to height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, a former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can go by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists during the winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods once inhabited the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
This country houses almost 300 museums.
You can't visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the diversion.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Jude Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to be seen: the Art Museum of Tel-Aviv.
It is mainly exposed to the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths composed of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Relli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Shining stars.
Then you hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three large resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can bathe there all year round.
In this respect, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains sauna and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
They are used to treat salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also simply to relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of Antiquity.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Persée saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young brides who come to take photo sessions from all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk into the Roman theatre, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to Tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchanged in shekels (now 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activity.
And the workweek starts Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also houmou, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of peas beans, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are plenty of well-fed cats that wander around the high air.
We can see them at night sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars.
These feline likes passing places and don't refuse to be given them.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While members of parliament and human rights activists argue about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
At the moment, this rule concerns only those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sector.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will need to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this Act.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations throughout the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will that give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the representatives of the migration service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passport, and they don't get the expected salary," confirmed the Chief of Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian nationals who want to come to earn money in Russia trust that they know not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would only be a viable primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they trust you.
"You feel dizzy and dizzy."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without the statute, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 nautical miles.
And then we can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, which is why cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik national.
"Go fast, don't hurt and buy yourself a nice piece of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by federal migration service employees.
Forgery paper comes from an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant hoping to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy those "papers".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they were shot at weddings or killings organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
Police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the arms port permit from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Douma in the near future.
Everyone is not satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "shrinking the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for BBC, said to the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military trail", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from the law enforcement forces.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been exploded.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been planned to conceal the deficit," said the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons plants that do not compete with competition in the international market and flow weapons into the black market, especially in Moscow," said an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organized the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Public Administration Research Centre.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain researchers, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons in the black market have been found there "because of the employees whose work is related to weapons," explains the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 per cent come from "hidden leaves".
A salesman and a cabinet consultant who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers are going to look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
She's being handed over by means of a grill.
"He transports it in the city and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be resolved, they make a check-up purchase from illegal arms dealers," added the seller.
"As in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to trade.
The price of the gun, it was given to me on site
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there must also come by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't.
Small new people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, he says, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
There's no secret for the buyer, Baranets says, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest vendor and we're setting up a target.
"I'm being shot and when I'm convinced that the gun is working well, we're starting to negotiate," says the expert.
A shop from his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".

"It's enough to have a specific amount of money," we write in advertising on "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?

People yell at food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I've heard about these types of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, may cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Gun" association, you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall decreased by 7% in Russia and rose to 22.9 miles, while proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cassier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will be scaled or quickly blown.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
At the same time as the increase in the modest wages of basic employees at Walmart and in the fast food chains, the organizers of the events wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a rain of balances taking over millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering lightning.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: layers to hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart run their races only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the $3.2 billion group.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would bring them back to 46 cents more.
They will spend just $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in just nine States and did not cause any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its cash registers made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
The company's spokesperson Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-hand site Huffington Post that all Walmart's "less than five" employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com transaction among so many others" by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, which is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase over time, but on average its core employees are in New York $8.90 an hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living in their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum you find comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The demonstrators who launched the move on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food waiters and cooks be paid at a minimum of $15 per hour, a double-fold increase than the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be established in the area of rapid restoration.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the protestors of a union by means of brigades or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking advantage of rapid restoration remains a difficult task, and that for concrete reasons.
One of the main features is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The flagship moment of the protest was the mid-day gathering near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you did honestly!"
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, particularly by Mayor Bill De Blasio's candidate, who stated that "we must all support the workers of rapid restoration in order to obtain a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important of the fast restoration sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it without counting that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's hard to tell at the moment whether this mass movement spark will make little ones.
"For the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain on average"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the reality increased through special glasses.
At first, it was Google who unveiled this summer's current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is evident from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We're working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment in pixels on a flat screen and sometimes on the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering the gesture.
- What does the future hold?
- Although Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, is not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems based on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our physical world to make it more touchy.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, in order to order appliances in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not large gestures, but rather discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet held by the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the present generation that we rely on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not megapixels themselves, but rather the quality of the matrix and depth.
With respect to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensors a steady delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need such a device in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames to the second.
- But shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a common sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or do it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As long as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking with a smartphone all the time the hands up is not practical but what I think is: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them (the personal elements are the only ones you can see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents to this idea point to the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be very good at adding touch sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and giving you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of your fingers.
There are also bracelets on wrists that influence nerve endings of fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to do harm: the way to make someone physically believe in a very small space that it walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of racing carpets (not to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, one can only manage on average to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in absolute fertility state.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburgian avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found a recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed red that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the connected parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
He is one of the most deeply social and philosophical peter-bourgeois tales, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the peter-sbourgeois vanguard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance smiles on the inhabitants and makes them feel good.
He recently took into his hands an organ of Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, image creator and society.
Even in society, anything that is not grey gives rise to aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was.
I understood that was my way.
So the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonvchtchina that gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
- It was important for me to find myself at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took a place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohème petersbourgeois.
Many were born there: Nom, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends were singing easy play-back songs in mowing jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer today.
When the group started performing live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg was a great fan of programming before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education, he received them from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the consequences of the artistic clinic.
Our employees left as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Pener of the Year," and it was then that my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new age with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and acuteity.
I'm going to have a show programmed "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to an timeless category.
Before I was a social person, it hurts today and it's scary to be like that.
But with clowns, everything gets out, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but rather we have to crack him in the trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- We've recently seen you in the role of the organ player in Barbarie.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur.
Disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into flocks, the bohemian supporters loved one thing, they denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communitys, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw who come to see, it's the sexual and social side that walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and after all it's less management, money, everything goes down.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the life.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not all can work in culture.
Under the reign of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are disbanded, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly assess these experts and make a way for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Fellowship
Hide in Space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board go looking for a relief planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to live our species as a pester or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, that would be only by chance.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Another half-century ago, there were experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land varieties.
Then we put insect orbits, small drosophiles breeding flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo was developed as a thickener.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the chicks were disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts fully atrophy.
The chicks reacted neither to the light nor to the sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We put our eyes together twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological miniature arch with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion " will only embark on species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, we didn't find anything supernatural.
"They were still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. This kind of research has to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet done directly in space.
It's not a bad deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not realized for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has most valuable.
Our wet took off and no one on Earth could tell if it would be going after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vachnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being on orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have very little, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and that give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they're longer, it's even dangerous during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosmonauts: mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in null floatability, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicle exits.
Water imitates the stinker.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to then get used to water.
It is logical in principle, because from birth to the first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weigher is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
As a crusher, the muscles of the belly, the basin are atrophying very quickly, the baby's pushability is lost.
Okay, well, let's just ignore this by using the birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asked Valery Poliakov to invite him to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, totally disqualified," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Earths will go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born into space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Public Finance Control Institute) said: "The control of the pseudo-independent work (Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Higher Financial Control Institute, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking in us," said Kala in her comment on the current situation.
A joint check carried out by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to import contractors with controls; is it therefore allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government can not prevent an authority responsible for carrying out an inspection to enforce the law," says Kala.
At the supervisory committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was he actually asking about?
This is parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and how to implement it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what is the result for you?
A common control of this kind should just help to stop us from trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude all enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It could be that this system is so submerged by the paperwork that those looking for faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As far as institutions are concerned, ISC also operates there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organised similarly, it also has a slightly different board, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar manner.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, to our system: Germany being a federal structure, therefore also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state in our home.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said to be doing better in all areas.
Is it possible that they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider to be a model is also faced with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, right?
As regards national legislation, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to you as an institution, has its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out a posteriori checks, we must have a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new tool for "detection of risks of mismanagement" with which we have gone to the critical nearly 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, for regional operational programmes) made the subject under control to accept that any breach of the Contracts Act would result in a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful, then, to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal errors without consequence of the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system banned or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He may declare: "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, and this is precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us.
Roads are by frozen places, but most are still practical.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were available this morning, but through frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 and -10 ° C but they should rise slightly during the day.
The snowfalls have ceased in the region and it remains in the plains only a thin layer of snow.
The crests of the Metal Mounts (Krušné hory) are covered, however, by about 30 cm of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that due to fog, visibility was reduced.
The R6 rapid road and national roads in the region are now accessible without difficulty.
However, vigilance is still in place, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It remains on some of their sections of frozen snow remnants and by traffic-tight spots.
Especially in areas at altitude, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohème roads are threatened by the formation of verglas and that traffic-tight snow layers can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of forming maggots in areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hour).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-stamped snow is present on roads in altitude areas.
In Bohemian East, time will now be dry, most often clear, with possible cloud passages.
It will blow down a low wind and temperatures will generally range between -3 and +1 C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, in places, there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the latest snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some channels of communication may be by frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is what the information from the regional road maintenance service indicates.
The D5 motorway is practically safe, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
Departmental and third-class routes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers in the areas of the Olomouc region at altitude must now have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the field tonight; according to roadside services, it fell more than three centimeters in Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the roads are easily accessible.
"On the heights of Šumperk district are snow remnants.
The drivers moving towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft snow layer "today told ČTK the head of road maintenance services of Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to them, following chemical treatment, roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are safe, however, in the district of Šternberk drivers should pay attention in the sections in forest areas to the remaining wet steps.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, the North Bohème Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult sections.
From police data, it appears that, in addition to some snow-covered places or verglas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, and so the snow and the verglas should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the Bohemian Central Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow spring during the day, sky clear and freezing during the night.
Also, since the main traffic routes, difficult conditions have been reported on the national road at the border between the regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until they reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps we love to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh about this rather and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a remnant of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you set up a completely unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential at the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m. in the morning.
On the eve of 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will close almost at the time of the end of the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the peaceful ocean, on a time zone in advance of 12 hours compared to us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the Cancelled World " (Czech " Kunex světa zrušeno ").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear her at these charitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in all three concerts.
The anthems will also join at a certain time in the context of a very unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, because we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to have them participate intensively in these projects.
It has turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studento training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly go to students at the Jedličkēv Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to an independent new building.
Will several bands of music and performers come up on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustrationsphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks at first.
We have five members in electric chair whose gears must travel in hold, of course we also trim lots of luggage and tool boxes....
Until now everything has been more or less always well done, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there it is not yet common for a person to move in an electric chair alone in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it clear to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a heavy disability move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the moment, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I'm a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we've created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator, Mr.A Angelovič, says, we have lost a little control of the situation (Laughter).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not wrong?
True, creating links with well-known singers and actively working to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the substance.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also enable us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some ways, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts long.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who first sees us is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of doing so, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many were there already in 1998?
One, there's Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012, beginning at 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Cancelled World " will be sung jointly.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studento Multifunctional Training Centre located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket preview is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of that agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before the second world war, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always find understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his work of avant-garde entitled "Introduction to Astronautics ".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a world-renowned spacecraft propagator, his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket was to be used to propulse or stop the drain.
The only known information about this drain is that of the press of the day.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It is evident from the documents preserved that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The purpose of these two projects was military use of rocket engines.
Just prior to the war, all the plans to use the rocket technique were carried out by the interim scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Comitéet Doradczo-Nukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to the astronauts
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautics Federation (created in 1951) and from the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, PTA's first president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautics Federation.
He kept his job until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first was launched on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was built, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have ranged up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of devices was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the law on public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility.
This decision has raised in public opinion a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in practice that the various economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital linked to a frenzied financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) generate tension over prices.
This means that a producer strives to import goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad or buying at low prices or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and hence responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State are necessarily increasing.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for the benefit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital generate in the various economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments place their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the private capital price dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand through a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as an auxiliary to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with wages of poverty, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital would invest in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the following question: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is no doubt true.
The evidence is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby in all States.
As a result, there is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the FFR, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as declared by Western-type constitutions, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in full delicacy and the functions were attributed to violence.
The beatings of wine pots, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The sub-de-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... ... "The honest people were not looking for any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls" ... "It was really started to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pomped, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, with no regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, it results in a decline without prior elites, without any effort to carry out reforms in depth.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for liberal-type democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss in human life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the law on public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international and at the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able" says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refract is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a "back to the curtain" view on which the tensions that have been persisting for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) are mainly used in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owed their actions to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished by the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the peacock (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 90s of the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to linkages between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were mixed and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of such countries were 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the EDF for triggering the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd level, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating Europe's great state monarchies, the second war was to eliminate colonialism, including British colonialism, and the third war should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeating crises such as those caused by them in 1907).
After successful in launching the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war suddenly ended with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the morculation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed far-reaching war repairs on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalizing the impoverished masses (then it is enough to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, creating a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which it actually held) of fifth columns to set the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the basis for a mass emigration of Jews into Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had originally held it; or whether everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war repairs imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit up a firehouse that could lead to a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide sharply between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another harm according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the very outset, there is the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the world?
Here we need to make a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers are offering people only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to launch a war with Iran, who could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait through which it transits 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor has only a width of 2 miles) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
What light now appears the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born is introduced at birth an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on the hand or forehead a mark to the red iron, so that he may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that the one who has common sense counts the figures of this fierce beast.
This number means man and it's six hundred sixty-six."
The Argo movie: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamic students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome; it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the liberation of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, which was further aggravated by the fiasco's attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats arrested were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations by the Algerian Government.
Their fate brings about a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed strongly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated periods, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team to make screenings for a major science-fiction film.
Gender combination
Tony Mendez's plan of exfiltration requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were long kept secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is on the one hand a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - such as in the Ocean's leven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
Ambients follow: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (in the sub-titled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were retranslated into the film, there are no great differences),
The lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, corridors and telephone...
Ben Affleck managed to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected stagewriter and his acting game ceased to generate ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The stage director had to be content with a subject offering in fact only a few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It is very good, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone shot in America and the continuation on the landing track is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operatives, their characters would have earned a greater place and are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He drives the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of yet another story, in a certain way, incomplete to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the business.
Rules for swelling balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public investigation of the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is now considering adopting a 40 percent quota of women for the management of large European companies was at the root of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, for the Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, there is already a recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women were advantaged with life insurance rates because they are objectively a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other idea as incredible as "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The EU’s controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which have adverse environmental consequences, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, leading to increased egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the fact ban to use the term "butre à tartiner" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 cm.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (also the Czech Republic currently imposes claims on its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission argued that it was merely harmonising non-homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables have been softened despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to waste of food.
The first price may be awarded in this investigation in the EU regulation of last year that must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 must not swell without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an US survey that balloons are among toys the first cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age in the case of blowing in fair bells.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official role within the EU cannot use the name "Macedoine" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let Do" association of liberal economists, the Bankovnipoplatky.com server has appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then goes beyond, for example, the fixed volumes for canned mushrooms and thus risks a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself in full stocks that it had subsequently had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular, to be used to write applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "The strange regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its general development deserve more praise.
More serious is, for example, experts say, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions in Czechs.
If, at the end of six years of fighting against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomocké tvarŏžky", for the term "Tuzemský rum" that goes back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar-based products, not beet sugar-based, can be called rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, there are now known worldwide cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or Parme ham, the Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kappr") and the hoplon of Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický pernik") and cakes called "Hořice's Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") may also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr Senator, how do we have the idea of presenting ourselves to the presidential elections?
It is not being a senator or president that counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the age of retirement increases.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please, then I try to bring a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am an independent member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You have entered the Senate, but you have quickly set off for the Castle (N.D.T.: Chair's seat).
Is that not how you turn your back on those who have elected you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected Senator, I would introduce myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we are talking about at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we tread on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I have been sued by journalists or that I have been the adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You started the battle for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get support from all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without partisan categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me on the left instead.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're going forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left-handed or right-wing but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what did you say doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them in my camp to enforce it.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want to.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president to direct suffrage, it was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without ambiance, being an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward alone, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person cannot make a difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to introduce themselves to the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, most of them gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to direct vote of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to set up your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I value about 60 million my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artworks worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and was fighting against evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth of assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example paying for my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to run for an election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say that you'd turn your activities into deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I won and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not just about imagination. To convince themselves, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mount - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig told us, a pass on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighbouring company, tells us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is going on his own free will in one of these bookstores, right?
Spijkenisse, a Dortoir town that has nothing attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam MVRDV's architects' office, master of audacious stick diagrams and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with its usual flegme and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a line on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still watching, disconcerting and waving their shoulders, Maas, confronted him, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and finished his speech with activist arguments by a: "common cry!"
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as it is said, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain has flown from land.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some semi-detached buildings and houses for a total of 50 houses.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
This is how this small terne village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a mayory of an oarsing laider, whose white facades invite them to think that they shelter a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, a lift takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you soak the floor of the building in the discovery of its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverberations speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public benches, dogs and small boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Usually, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely altered the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books was properly built: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment centre and the building's technical plant.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes laminates, sometimes balustrades, sometimes climbing ramps.
A new experience for seeing, touching and smelling.
Even the architects and engineers of the endurcis building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an agricultural company ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, for years, the synthetic membrane of a millimetre of thickness has been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was first compressed in such quantities in plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us an impressive view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot figs.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of air moisture in the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project for ecology," Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only gives light to the interior, even on the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass façade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, described even the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has been used to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully maintained (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are all over the place.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
In this way, MVRDV has achieved the master's discipline, which is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention when voting on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status in the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen abstention when voting on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have any difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean to the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt independent positions of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position towards the conflict in the Near East and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important developments in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must take care not to undermine public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this because it is not a unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany interfere with its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will not be respected any more.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are varied.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the true differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem so.
If you observe relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastic about Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
Therefore, they cannot join a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are doing in the euro issue at the moment.
In my opinion, Germany will play a locomotive role in the future and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
That has always been a delicate question.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that makes them more independent.
Does Germany play a role as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still faces difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed with neighbors and very varied opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this gap, which is still there?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially deposited in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such that the company bearing its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd make a profit.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the Taylor Wessing firm specializing in violation of the right to property in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to record their trademarks.
So, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also duly copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a ranking in which records are made from the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the company artificially created by a part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, shopping centres are located on several floors that sell practically counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its leaders charge it to attack the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The mark is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, particularly in respect of expensive lighthouse products.
According to CLSA market analysis company data, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world luxury market and the fastest developed market.
However, it is not easy to delete the dubious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism, because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded BMW's. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiars of Hong Kong and Singapore which had reorientated the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademarks Office in Beijing admits that there were some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year, the Office would have spent a "emergency situation in the course of work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing a 75% increase compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings are still pending at the office.
Deal cost cost
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the TMO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of right of registration.
In other words, each recording reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the issuer was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The Trademarks Office therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg has certainly gained cause from the following two instances, but the other side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is in place
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds, "the procedure is long, and it is very difficult and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large six-digit euro amount" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what this means for us," Wenzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if the impersonators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of the unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds, "The vigilance is on the table."
Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trade marks law, rather, foreigners should "registrate also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler said.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of the registration.
If Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or, then, we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: tap foot, sing, help
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland AIDS rejoice in their coming.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketball, women's scarves and moccasins for men are looking for rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very soon, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly expand - loud, low, tenor and soprano -, they prevail, stink and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came from genetician in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choirman has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros by less, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zuluu "counter of stories" or even "singer of praise".
No one can speak fluently the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany for now to bring it back to its native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres by flight of Heidelberg bird, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40 per cent of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw huts or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the ills that afflict Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless ensures a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally made a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal each day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been working almost professionally for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhage (or gonorrhea).
Current ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis and gala thumbs belong to parasite ISTs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blenarrhage often occur in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contact between men is the source of at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydia, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungic), blonnorrhage and human papillome virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of CHlamydiated infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillome virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases may cause abscesses in the genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower-ventrile pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners should pass regular examinations.
Most fast-tracked ISTs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, gifts, but above all to the funds collected by the choirists through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are housed in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, this is what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The homeless orphan is welcomed to a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for over 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the American health organization PSI, the association has organized an HIV testing for many inhabitants.
This is not true of itself, because even if the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These measures sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to foster cultural exchange, Imbongi choirists travel together every two or three years in southern Africa and sing full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still know about apartheid time.
The bus filled with whites that sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears out a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres flying bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choirists who tap their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergeimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe provided evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet continuously plunged into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that could go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one is linked between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Inaware of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which they observe the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Naine Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the universe's delivery room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unsavory name, in the constellation of Cassiopee, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flashing burst of a star dying.
The beignet-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when she dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, star lovers also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the colours.
On this infrared picture, the Helice nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located at 700 light-years in the constellation of Verseau.
His similarities with an earthly continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmes of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and cleanest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the colour, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, several thousand light-years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust tranadas divide the glowing heart of the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomists photographed the premias of a cosmic carambollage in the Serpentaire constellation: 400 million light-years from the Earth, the two-galaxies-melting nuclei are precipitating each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "austral firewheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cephée.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic clicks taken by different telescopes.
Here you can see the circle of black holes that is at 430 million light-years of the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our dairy path.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also create at all times young stars at 5,000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and penetrated from a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the vertical angle level, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using Arecibo's radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "research for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing its machine's computing power.
View on the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés by 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They treed two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru and IRTF telescope.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the Kepler Space Telescope was launched.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as early as 2018 on a Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will be assigned to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
For decades, radar data had indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a long-lived museum.
An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.

An investigation into a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is of a scalding romance.
Behind the many turns of the road, the small cahot bus along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group lives on the name of Talysh, about which we do not know much, unless they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small plastron town with its too aggressive architecture of Soviet times that does not agree at all with the landscape of picturesque mountains.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be here the oldest people's festival in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is director of the Longevity Museum, the only museum of the kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh from the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Having another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think the oldest documented person was 122, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the man at the age of Central Asia.
"Obviously old people also live in certain parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documentation, including the absence of a civil status record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of that country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that food rich in calories from Talysh, who likes meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasian region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a bart, whose contents are untiringly beaten.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long grown up.
Two little children are also swimming in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests serving in typical armed glasses in the form of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids from a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," said Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda surprises an old lady's mouth.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham subsequently succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva monthly receives 230 manats (about the same amount as in euro) for his retirement, an amount that guarantees a good train in the region.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirzayeva is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on Charia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not full of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but especially for Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
For all the members of the disquieted and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by his apology, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the US University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overturned?
The 234 articles quickly written by the predominantly Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and this was still a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the legal margin that stems from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article which states that, with regard to all subjects relating to the Sharia, the University of Al-Azhar must be consulted. The institution is the largest Islamic institution in the country and its burst spread over all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would in fact result in the judicial custody.
Many aspects of the draft Constitution are matters of interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts used to repress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Also doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "injure people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points, therefore, are matters of interpretation in the Morsi draft which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution was reborn"
The opposition has been on the move for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the Charia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is coming back and we're going to win," Hamdin Sabbai launches, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and Former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the dust of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim confrerie called for counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other shore of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Koran [was their] Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as their supporters, had spoken loudly and loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the direction that the country must take.
The Islamists project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was shot, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are shocking violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto deprives him of all his powers," Saeda laments.
However, a democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.
A protester on the Tharir Square warns: "You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most stinking fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite for the premises for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salted trout and fermented in the water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and is cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you drink a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, a full-time local fireman who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people enjoy small pieces of fish and get a lot of drinks.
"Some people prefer water to rakfisk," adds Harvard.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in ponds of water in the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses softened by alcohol - food.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigranting to the United States.
Now, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital yet odorant element of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to his liking.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our servant, with the blond hair and eyes of a transcendent blue, the image of northern well-being, with a plate of rakfisk in hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to notice.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the strings of its tight stock market.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and take the summer hike, we are happy," said Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in an unwary laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and waiting to buy myself what to eat - I had my rakfisk dose.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where we use rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a knot-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in Eurovision's competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here's our points, Harvard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the people's expectations, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where bottlenecks are legion in normal time, a security dam has been established since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico's economy is doing well, with the results due to the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to contacting the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentaculous state that encloses the capital. On its land of preference, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises assign it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, formerly bossied and full of cracks.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes," said his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failing to hold office, the PRI was evicted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside Los Pinos' presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of the opponents who blame the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent man of state and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, contrasting with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military were called upon to rescue them to combat drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In an area of disaster, the bodies of dozens of women murdered have been found on the edge of discharge over the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was a governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to point out the problem of killings committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse their administration of refusing to see reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this depressed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs.Bundia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body stiffness had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old Commer, a troublemaker, a bitch.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as President as when he was Governor," said Olvera, member of Congress in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the allegations of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during the detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case because Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, Friday, that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the root of the biggest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning demonstrated his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions in Manning and recorded their answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was globally "very professional."
The forms did not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not report the issues raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted this status to be removed... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and had vanished once due to heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept in mind what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were mattresses, blankets, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, as sleeping or being stretched during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also stated that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up so he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deducted from his guard's order that he should let go of his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a martial court, a trial that should be held early next year.
Defence stated that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, leading to the illegal publication of Internet information, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all the charges are held, he shall bring about a life-long criminal sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for Mexicans ("Mexicans"), another for Foreigners ("Foreigners").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing what line I was headed to.
I grew up in central California, where I was called "Mexico" my whole life.
It's an ethnic qualifier, just like my friends from Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends from New York when they call themselves "Italians".
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather born, no need for special qualifications or union traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the Foreigner line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their priority themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wishes to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half their territory at the end of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and no more minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints about how Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbours -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we went to good schools and have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree in the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they touch us as if we were inferior and not Mexican individuals.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly demanding their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset.
Although she's an American citizen, she feels like she's a part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know have no impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that absolutely needs to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And when we consider the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, guys.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them to be treated in the way that their family members have not been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab spring has blown up everything, and whether or not we want it, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to exercise optimism.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fights have strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has dried up.
Having killed some of its leaders and refuting the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has made and caused for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members retire and say that the growing Islamist is bent around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this depot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily turned to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was turned into a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unfailing support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the origin of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fires in Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that impedes the West Bank, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish colonies that continue to spread despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman near the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do you suck these Palestinian chips by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will take it long; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the gift.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to manage their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good wish -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now endeavour to end the movement of weapons to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very eccentric vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of brand name
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating all glamour representations.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said federal health minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and if these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would boost trade in the black market, which would provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"Bad consequences will come from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco Australia.
The fakes of China and Indonesia will sell more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased significantly two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco contested the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population range targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the perfect place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been worth making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
I don't mind the photos.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you put the package together," said Victor El Hage when he bought a package on which he had a picture of mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobaccolist" in central Sydney, said uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on display.
"Before, it took me an hour to download a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's good, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend a half-day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development commend the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths or even to feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The bore goes very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evokes boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After having gone through many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of " wanting to do something, but not succeeding in engaging in a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a maussated mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can look like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem is from them.
Sometimes we may think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Uninvolved Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which the participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all hear the soundtrack.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or relevant task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when we are torturing or scruffing, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to remain physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to stutter learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a single-corded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centers of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to become more bored than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quick to blame.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents claimed to be bored at school and during their homework at home, while 23 per cent said to be bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level," especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, betting or abusing certain substances to spend time, as studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers point to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-governing himself, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant boiling that generates activities and technology is the goal we should tend to achieve.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and material that can be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without further delay.
Police have ceased to charge adults aged 21 and over for possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuan sales in their neighbourhoods.
"Things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking themselves questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is desired or not, is in advance of most marijuana regulatory states, first about therapeutic use and now about personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could rely," he said.
The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the cannabis Legalization Centre, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City aroundey" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer pursue those 21-year-olds who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop charging people for such a "immediate" crime.
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "roundey district" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, incarnates a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure users to become detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear as adults for possession of restricted quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana detention cases without delay.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents those accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who consume marijuana, too, have difficulty accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While state defenders and representatives are planning a new legalized sales border, they are looking forward to the federal government's guidelines, which always call for the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed marijuana sales to be practiced in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are not likely to break down the doors to seize small drug bags, there is strong evidence that it opposes the licensed sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama political advisor.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Prior to the vote, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuan sales, even if it was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and it is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we are faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
Today's students are not the only ones who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was an outstanding place to know for me, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I settled in Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and started to cry.
My friends were confused.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson pointed out with faeces that I was gone after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away, because I had been bullied and constantly being bullied.
Not because of my name rather outlawed, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why would you mention this today?
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of middle-right students undergo the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Room (JCR) said that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right) dedicated to student politics, which depicts the "Touries" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
In particular, student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moved to the Rolls-Royce, was a full silver tree and moved with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as issuing goats for the introduction of higher education costs."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the U.C.O.A., said that there was a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are in the centre-right.
"It constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking like that during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and with paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinian vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students met the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that not only did teachers participate in sarcasms towards Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy about minors strikers, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victims of involved a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pulsus face, took easy.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he threw a loud tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a little touch on my shoulder.
He was a student in the second year of English studies, named James, who presented himself as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid so.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory pretend to be Labour (Workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted on the fact that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This stratagem failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over.
I was perverted, you bastard.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Did I just have a normal life in Oxford?
Were I forced to meet people who shared the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become a Labour and denied my opinion?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history professor, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never here.
He hated this insignificant and provincial place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to take a shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dream bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a working session conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Rogging inwardly in shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them as "crazy old man."
The rehearsal was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail into my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can treat me with wet milked chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also benefited from an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couturier clients.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-cut models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "sister" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with loving kingship.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette megots on your beautiful carpet as some pop stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to our Gstaad chalet," explains former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, close friend of past beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charm of the tailor either.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go away from fashion, because its creations are works of art," she ends.
Nobility line parade
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions but shared love.
He likes high people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamorous podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to walk on the podium to admire a "public" dream with Valentino's main creations, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
Among this crowd of mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "not possible to forget".
I remember perfectly well.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a vest of the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors it uses, they are bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Modest Patricia della Giovanpaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a flying skirt, a draped buster and a drop-off.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg retains the evening dress of the tailor with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also the whole memory of her vehicle".
The "kings" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller brought during his marriage with Paul from Greece in 1995.
It took four months to work and 25 "ragazze" (the seammaker thus calls its seams) to make this ivory silk dress with incrustations of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a stretch of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high stitching of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Fascinated for years by the "being-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani cumulates as many honours as any of its clients' spouses.
"They are refined, their calm, their healthy and perfect appearance has always jumped into my eyes," he admits.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago that he had a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the wearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the breath of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating from the earth's guts solidifies to the contact of the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that reaches 2,386 meters above altitude, but exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to scale this distance, at a tortoise, keeping the balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen's miners earn 5 cents euros for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once at the top, he wanders a path among tourists photographing them as if they were circus animals, and carrying heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little in contravention at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry as this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 dollars (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who generally travels three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 dollars (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would earn in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (EUR 1,20) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (EUR 167)", says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was €75,000 (€6.20) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java for her to convert to Islam."
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At age 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then he suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Despite life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a server or a receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood measure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur never ceases to melt at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who work for them and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2,50) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1,20), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not humans," protest Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... to which their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets are added.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers from there by a trail of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik by opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to it, the video has spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
Words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to fulfill their "national duty".
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that this was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take this lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, considered to be the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says that it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the establishment of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that add barely disguised xenophobia to new immigrants, especially to the Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced its worst election results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in birth rates has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put on wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
If so long these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people give it up later," says a young frame.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another young man from about twenty years old tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babymaking, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by spreading events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with personal and "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private word on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been holding an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I'm not going to share one of my pictures or someone who's gonna be an idiot," he said.
The young boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is a member, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them," he says.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't trust anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young man, no one has made any progress or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we are familiar with today under the name of cyberharch are not foreign to the young boy.
A close to one of my friends has been hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not close his account.
"He only passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would place pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberharpment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in education at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we ourselves are learning," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or tell at an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective, while what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them reflect.
"They say not to do so is useless," she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given time?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do it offline.
They're the same rules.
"At Internet times, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary teacher and education adviser, says that it is essential for parents to read conscientiously the conditions of use of social networks.
Understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Ef has tried several times to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of States and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency first reported that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to summit information has been consistently limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information among journalists was given by press officers from some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding more important information.
Later, Peru's presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech rather than the official document that concluded the summit.
In October, Peru was host to the 3rd Arab South American Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested with the press, it had not also issued the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was issued last March.
During the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which establishes a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima has tried against Santiago and that starts in The Hague on Monday.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we bring before this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and tribunals," added President Piñera by handing President Humala a hand, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011, after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project lines had been established among South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would set up "important initiatives to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permits agreements".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "co-operation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, low-priced Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and find a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We decided to favour a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerned with Peru and were on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions Paraguay's political situation.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow it to be re-entered into the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday next to Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgement of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will call for a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have planned to assist the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the Summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which attempts to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru shall preside over the regional bloc pro tempore.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had met during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they were almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the other hand, we, the South American, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not personally betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice, which demanded that he submit to an interrogation on an alleged sexual offence in his territory, while "Swedish law itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done since Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that her physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"It works on anyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the allocation of a safe haven that would allow her to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and points out that it has had discussions in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a series of procedures at various European forums," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the exception-conduct tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully permits, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or would question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse political men but the bad journalists on the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must stand firm and not tolerate opportunityism and attempted coup d'état deguised", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole in order to get past them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgment so firm as to be."
With reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa ensured that, if he lost primary education in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I won, that would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If you ever forgive us, I'll do it, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"That doesn't mean a relapse of President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: seropositive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about his illness and his hard feelings were such that he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He was undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic would not say goodbye "because he was voiceless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he notes that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those with a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, it means that for someone who will receive a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, "while he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75," said the scientist interviewed.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is today an average of 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS follow-up has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed any medication, the problem is that patients come to very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to perform earlier diagnoses and, for this, to offer tests of screening in a massive way, to all those who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who have had to do their testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, despite his age, he was already a AIDS carrier and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I burst out three times a week," they say, "that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know he's suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but co-responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, on the march of World AIDS Day.
If they take the test, if they've taken risks, the sooner they'll know if they're HIV positive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one lies in prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of 100, it is very good, but as a result, that today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to counters, but are found in public toilet distributors and in places where young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it the question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in many of the new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination occurs by sexual means, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal means.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know HIV.
A judgement ratified in appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario provides a negative precedent for all national corporations with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It would therefore appear that the survival procedures of Mexican companies are not valid in the country at the starboard, at the same time as international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the decision taken on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will enable Mexico's main glass manufacturer to seize the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register in accordance with the U.S. bankruptcy law, the appeal court of the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the formalised commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that, without the inter-corporated vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here are about half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures had secured debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any way the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
Data omitted from the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had encountered since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For now, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States will call for non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court.
The most serious thing is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the friend curiae ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Faults Act was detailed, noting that this would release it from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Faults Act.
In addition, it notes that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carnation of two parts: they take Vitro and they take the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the former patron of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Syndical Association of Aviation Pilots has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, sponsored by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 trust from bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They sit the Dragon Mars
Meeting at the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the great wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in bringing together the governors of the South-East to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafection Commercial Agreement, known under its English-language logo of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, since it was regarded as an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basket-ball is my life"
The "Hetin" Reyes basketball world-growth has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the land and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage did not condemn it to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, a national team manager and leader, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his itinerary beyond standards, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he has most affected are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"That was my best years, the ones I most enjoyed because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, be it as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has done many years of satisfaction, including the five competing championships from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired at the 1981 championship, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a handy player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
It's like starting Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico's ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shots.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He welcomed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great maneuver of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre- Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a raid on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medal and great joy during the Neuquén pre- Olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurrutiner replacing players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt it's Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having was part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field personnel and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), worldwide became known for the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of business without scruples, fearless and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family release sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved native town of Dallas, once again playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived his life in full," Gray said in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized having been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had been grafted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles at the cinema are well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened her with prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played Ewing's role as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "The honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as of a man " huge, both on screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and one sixth is under way, informed the chain.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT channel have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who has known fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her birthday in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s impositable memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver graft, he became an active organ donor activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to operate and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be okay."
He was also active against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hammock there: the end of the "great discount" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax wrench that some called "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we said it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach on "the end of the world" this semester, which, in theory, will be the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker offers the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas thrive with time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students of any choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, from the University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursery, says he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less one teacher, told us to believe in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project was about Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a senior student in Temple, aged 21 and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I agree that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts of the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who gave courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew that we were taking courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, many of the alleged dates of last judgment have been discussed, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or the philosopher that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us they thought they were going to parties "from the end of the world."
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
