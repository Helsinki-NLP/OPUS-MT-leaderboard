A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of the American governments enacted new laws that made the process of registration or voting difficult as of 2009.
This phenomenon has expanded following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, those laws reduce periods of early voting, invalidate the right to vote as an elector on the day of election and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photographed identity document.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
Therefore, the republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photographed identity document.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photographed identity document issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photographed identity document.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most for democratic candidates cannot use the photographed identity document issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote on Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters wishing to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the general elections of 2004, the voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators passed legislation in five other states that favoured the reduction of the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11 per cent of the voters, equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked a number of bills.
The United States Prosecutor ' s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the submission of a photographed identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the biased nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report from the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed at the electoral school to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this respect, measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you test or not do it?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant to themselves, doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
Do you take the test or not?
We asked for advice from the specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States found a large number of contagions among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain mortality difference between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years of age, further demonstrated that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Afro-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are painless.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. He or she should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not attack long-term life, in which case one should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly identifying precise criteria to decide who or not should be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would be at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
On the other hand, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly damages the health of people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
A particular hopeful: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced to half.
Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Charcutery products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat for your smoking, drying or salad may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely safe.
However, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem few, we will see what this is about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to violate that standard and do not try too much, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which is largely composed of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which is indeed extraordinary, the bosones are divided into two groups: the months, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the boson of Higgs would be somehow related.
These bosons, you might stress here, they're not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as an "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" there is an electromagnetic wave (from light, from infrared, from ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the boson "force carriers".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That is why a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great hadron collider is a 27 km circle ring!) is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do so, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself stuck at the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do do have a mass, while the rest (like photon, by the way), do not have it.
However, what "can contribute" all these investigations? asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to examine the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
On the other hand, many desperately want to be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of these investigations on our daily lives is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be none.
To see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They'd come across the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 during his optical research.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this catcher now serves as "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care, the best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In its Commission Morir in dignity, Quebec had recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon while a bill is being prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Duty tried to see him on the fence.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
"They had given me five years of life, but I've been like that," he says, made a pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be ready for this," he continues.
The disease has caused you damage: a huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who give him attention, brings him medication, and offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is for diarrhea to heal, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made your children discover.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have any desires in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, one last visit of his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body is offered and it helps food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctorates of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying are offered mouthwashs with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, your son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being equal.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age with cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadboisarrivent Center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem with access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the home palliative care society of Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative deficiency in Quebec's health care that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminence of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergencies suffering great pain without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are obsessed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick people who ask to die thank their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unsolved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to a fellowship of journalism from Canada's health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fund raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafia.
An "industry" which came too expensive to the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system sprays once we've hunted the big media," Jacques Duchesneau, a member of parliament in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation of the wrongs linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister of that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional portion.
Commission Charbonneau "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "show the stratagems that exist behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau Squadron" police, which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "scantarillat cartel" moderate to inflate contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has registered in series allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal offices such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outlying city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambico, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused quite a stir in explaining to the committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambim distributed money to the right and left during the years 2000, giving over $88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for former Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he influenced.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices between 30 and 40 per cent in respect of false extras.
In addition, a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking out for a parallel budget and filled his dirty money items.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to promoters in full boom real estate.
70% of the money in electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "from a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits."
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds but a clean research unit in Montreal would be required and be very vigilant so that doubtful practices do not repeat.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is particularly concerned about the role of the '"elect politicians in the knowledge of the stratagem".
By estimated by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for funding electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironic: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "we cannot fall any lower; go to the bottom, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story haunts the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look into the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I advance day by day next to you.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not warm.
From my beginnings in the pre-forming center of INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on to exciting steps.
It's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has given me a lot about my position.
It is supported by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one the same in League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The trust you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed our position as leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have ranked for the eighths of final in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our leagues in front of the Port so we can get the eighth round of finals.
Can the PSG become a great short-term European club?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to its means of implementing this project.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we were counting on the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it'll be good.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have guns to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting for more of the PSG?
It is normal for them to wait a lot for us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find things to reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not been able to qualify for eighths of the end, and they have also invested so much!
In view of the inverted amounts, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impressed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished carrying the trophy.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We better say we have a zlatandendendendence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he sets many goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's shown on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the 2012 Eurocopa with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from amassing game time.
I saw things there and I got reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today.
What view do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the World ranking group.
The picker is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved its goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads to the selection in Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to sit the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, transactions identified and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol for safe exchange of files like BitTorrent.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The quote of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before returning to round the ten dollars today (the quotations are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even occasionally changing).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of accounting books, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins changes consist of the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file segmentation, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one-hundredth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The mistake used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from Weizmann Incite in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant basses" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been changed," Jon Holmquist rejoices, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a textbook on that currency, believes quite in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a non-contact mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain in anonymity.
The system is easy to set up in businesses, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", needs Pierre Noizat, who ensures that it has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, today considered high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mostly Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they join the Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek or Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which was observed from the top of the hill planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old people, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making use of government land to resell them as suns for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
These young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be given work.
All, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. TV and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstitution of provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has sought to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, abolishing the position of the prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, her country depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been fixed, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining exploitation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig the huge Buddha site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls ' schools, children's schools, a French university department, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "get hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, eager to obtain local labour, have been able to help contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
For them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid.
A Constitution with forces in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the following day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues "traiting his word" and "passing the right".
It is ensured by its supporters that this is a measure to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days a referendum should be organized.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains a ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote my text or I hold full powers", powers that are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not enforce their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As was expected, the items voted were unanimously.
On the other hand, commentators are grateful that one of the few disagreements of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee came to think that the time of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all the views, is at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that they could replace "the principles" with "the norms", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals treat him hypocritically and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising act.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who must confirm their conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not inferior but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Bluuet, who is preparing an Egyptian constitutional transition thesis.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, for the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be raised in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to decide above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that there are few compared to those during the previous regime.
Another point of conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
The prosecution of civilians in military courts, as called for by human rights associations, will not be prohibited.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go out on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State manifested themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the world's obligation and a sea of brine
The promised earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a future nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Painosa").
It begins in the fortress of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial took place, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the burial place of Jesus.
In this very place is also the symbolic Christian Obblique of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then come true.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Until there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you won't be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has paintings of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some former Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that can easily hold up to those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmon and healing bars and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves into order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the Citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this was where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mise" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shequels (currently $1-3,8 shequels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any kind of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by doing transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays are celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes where milk and meat are combined.
There we offer a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are moulded garbanzo balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their taste" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
Snoringers love crowded places and do not reject greedy ones.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will go out for 15 sheqels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 sheqels.
Israel as figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amounting to 51 per cent at the same index in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants Save for the Language
As deputies and human rights defenders discuss the implications of the law on compulsory examination, they have already appeared in the country where they trade in "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December a law enters into force, according to which each migrant worker must carry out an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be sufficient to carry out the examination of the language, but also of Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is for citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be sponsored by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by state officials and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: What will this really bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language, both for Russians and immigrants themselves, bring?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of the cases.
Problems are experienced by immigrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language or go through medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paying trip" on a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"They are promised something in their homeland, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, Chief!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don't even have anything to feed their children, because they don't talk about dressing them up, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and language difficulties themselves.
Moreover, legalization costs money: twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us one hundred or two hundred cigarettes or tea rubles," Taiwan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told the journalists.
"Come on, don't be geeky, buy a paint."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was pointed out that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
Forgery documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully passed the examination the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to implement the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of arms of civil use.
This is the reaction of the government to recent incidents: To shoot during wedding celebrations where there were fortunately no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Tore seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "irrefutable rigour" be stopped.
The percentage of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented at the service of BBC news from Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 there were 142 crimes involving firearms registered in internal organs, compared with a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil-use arms sector will not be a drawback for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, you can find any weapon at low price in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Víctor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms orders
The first, "military or military coating", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here are included stolen weapons from police warehouses and stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," says an ex-militar.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including that of Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and data on public access to portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons, and 5 per cent correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the arms shops, who called for his last name not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators had not been bought by anyone for a long time because they were too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some alderman, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we tell
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be carried out, they make proof purchases to illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are often found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the "Beegovaya" platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "squinite" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there must also be arrived, say "from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to hijack him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this subject was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "all."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
To the buyer, according to Baranets, they do not offer him cat by hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not just buy; we go with the vendor to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
The search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal encounters.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a TT. Moscow gun," he tearfully puts his question to Fedorenkov.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-hand captures for those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one stays without a gun and is put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-hand captures for those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the onion, and then to extract coal from Siberia," he says.
Makarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
One and a half months will have to be expected.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
The employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are being attacked.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has been launched in the United States at the Walmart Corporation supermarkets and in restaurants in the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and to simmer in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, some Walmart corporation workers, who employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are averaged between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and supply of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" event participants demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 an hour, this will cost the $3.2 billion corporation.
This is about 1.1% more than what it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its shops from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview to the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" employees from Walmart and that the protest had been only "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free Box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely the great Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for this reason there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
Nobody wins less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the exhibitors, in part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few viewed this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing trade union movement activists with rigours and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main features is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disagreements
Rough protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular the member of the City Council of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he is selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent Democrats in New York, such as the mayor's candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As reported in the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were fast-food workers, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is still unclear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain isn't that easy."
The theme of increased reality, so popular among modern tech fans, is recently perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Early in the summer, at his annual Google conference he demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, Microsoft was also known to have filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Cambridge Microsoft lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the scientists of that company, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group?
- We dedicate ourselves to the interaction of person-computer, but we also try to broaden the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the work phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with its finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else lies ahead for the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, most of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes on 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world must be freed from computer science to ours, to our physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, it's still pending to resolve the issue of privacy, as it doesn't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project on which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Are you missing resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current movements of 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work to be an equivalent of such a device, but it would require no contact to make the frames per second more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up an intelligent phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in which is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics usually point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is found gives a similar feeling that one feels if someone was blowing it in the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not that easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements come beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even having Russia know them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion and opening meetings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophosic taleists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguardism of St. Petersburg in the late 1980s - the early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the smiling inhabitants and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took an organ into his hands and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm devoted to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, the image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray provokes aggressiveness and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who took "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I went to the theater for clothes, for all kinds of music, but not for lyrics.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music club, a bohemian club, the house of the Bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Lenningrado".
Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many programs prior to the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, the honesty and the culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them are clearly expressed the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a time category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and terrifying.
But in clowns everything gets stuck and tragedy gets eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting externally, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person is not owed or given his hand, but spit on his face.
And the deception will be removed when you change clothes.
A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, can commercial art be nice?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people gathered in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplions others.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every religious hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they arrive for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones. That's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, grew up under the example of artists living in poverty and dying in poverty, denied money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is a concept: culture officer.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When kings were right everything was otherwise, kings may not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who assess them correctly and open the way for them.
It is now prospering subjective personal taste.
The same Erata, but the difference is that they honestly say not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board start in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity is asked the main question: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in Venus' orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the insect breeding in orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979 they were sent to the quail egg space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of ingravity.
We get a normal pollutant as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
By not finding support, the chickens gave random twists.
And after 10 hours in newborns, there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chickens born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatelite "Bion" will only travel one-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of direct reproduction in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been travelling in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our bird flying, and no one on earth could say: if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after one year of flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights everything worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation of the flight.
Under null floating conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its birthplace.
The small-amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In summary, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, it is necessary for women to gravitation, the force of gravity.
Ingravity of abdominal and pelvis muscles decrease very rapidly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will give us the opportunity to bring to Earth a disabled person, a totally inadequate person," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Biomedical Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is being eroded.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," he describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude toward the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not disturb businessmen with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office which has an obligation to carry out such checks or to demand obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
That is to say in a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by practice itself.
We have united everything and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is " stricter and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us to stop investing efforts in the realization of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting something suitable at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the tender limit means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper", that those who want to look for faults in the system can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as they are now.
You speak of our country's problems with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office like our NKU or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The powers are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are at this level, and in this respect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled at the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately defined in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't mean any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, would it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did your Office mean by the amendment of the law on public procurement? Is its incidence manifest in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post checks, a certain delay is needed.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have begun a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", by which we have made nearly 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. Changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are corrected and similar.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that rather, it is a trick for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the rules "harden" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it then make sense to harden the law in this way?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, referring to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system banned or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of government can prevent the Office's performance that has an obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we will do as if nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, legislation is quite strict as to how to act formally, and this is what it should be like to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer not to meet formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are transportable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most routes are transitible, caution should be exercised in some cases.
Karlovy Vary region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they presented ice and snowboards.
The temperature goes down and ranges between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the road control centre of the region's roads.
The R6 rapid road and the first-class road in the region are now transportable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on some bridges whose surface can be frozen and rebald.
In addition, all second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still layers of ice debris and apisoned snow.
Greater attention is needed on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some East Bohemia roads there is danger of ice cream and in higher areas and in the mountains there may have been a layer of snow on the roads, reports on its pages the Direction of roads and highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and above all on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the mountains roads from Krkonoše to Orlické hour.
There is a snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, today the sky will be between clear and partially clouded, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range between three below zero and one positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitible today in the morning, although caution must be extreme and adaptation will be necessary at the time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be ice cream, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snow and the subsequent decline in temperatures, some pathways may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will meet with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from the information from the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is nearly unrestricted, although caution is recommended, especially on the way between 80 km and 131 km.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be layers with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case it is also warned of layers with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transit routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers who head to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partially empty snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed snow during the night; on the Šumper road they piled up about three centimeters of snow, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transportable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with medium-disposite snow towards Jeseník," confirmed today an operator of the Šumper road administration at ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also came to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now cleared and wet.
On the road to Olomouc the roads are transportable without restriction, on the road to Šternberská drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
North Bohemia road operators have reported complications in different sections at first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the pavement. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central mass, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the mment.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Since general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kinice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month, the end of the world will come, how do you feel about it?
It's just one of so many other alarm news that we like to grab.
To the music group The Tap Tap we rather like to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-of-the-art act that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the previous day, on December 20 at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, canceled".
Is it currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear at the beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it'll be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will be connected simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays Jesus' leading role in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We put all our effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will be the purpose of the money collected in concerts against the end of the world?
Equipment for the educational center without barriers Study, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkēv ustav.
The students at the school of Jedličkēv usetav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkēv usedatav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters work.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrationsphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will play in Prague.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar " spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the tools...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which always surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no frequency that a person travels alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematicize the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with serious disabilities to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will begin to change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we looked a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkēv usedtav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophon, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator La La, Angelovič says, we left a little of our hands (Laughter).
However, popularity hasn't come up until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite a lot to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the assistance of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to be a teacher of quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that all new things are welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and those we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works well for people with disabilities, then, it is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe?
If we want to do quality work, we must be rigorous in many respects and demand certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go for two days to test, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: There Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Anyone who has will and will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without STUDEO barriers in Jedličkovskyv usedav of Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the advance sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA of the former block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos began a long time earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great booster of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a drain was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who the author of the proposal was, nor are the project's milestones known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
Information on this Dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation reached the stage of the practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Comitéet Doradczo-Nakowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronomical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronomicalczne).
In the November 1954 edition of Problemmy magazine, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to the astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) had aspired to become a member of the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He served this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg weight.
Later, it was completed to build the RM-1A version and in the summer of 1959 the air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets were started in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed by the space available for scientific equipment.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was later built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the CoSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the CoSPAR National Committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social work.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with one another.
The cause is in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with the unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to that end "proves a drop" of the competitor's price in order to be made with most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the labour price, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment caused by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
This whole situation is conducive to the total disinterest of employers for paying taxes and compensation for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where the Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thereby attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already about a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The saving measures of almost all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abismal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a gross wage at the limit of society, hoping that one day they will reach the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty then moves from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian and African continue to work for a small part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the satisfaction that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which would lead the economy to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by getting involved in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political process and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
The situation in Germany is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracies quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been breaking up and the administrations were busy with force."
In exchange for bribes, ill-gotten favors and help finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered, and people came to the polls with the pre-worded vote... "There were no people in character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was self-cracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompey, Caesar went up to power and turned democracy forever into self-cracy.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today's society is based on disregarded preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is unable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, a decline of the unprecedented elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next blow.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech Republic government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That noting comes from violence and noting ever could," Sting in his song Fragile and whose rhyme prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children wanted no wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have emerged.
One, on the Israel side, argues for the right to self-defence and encases Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and stains Israel of a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
At every time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Of these astronomically rich families, one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It's not written much near them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, declared themselves or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subjugated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the War of Secession to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Albert Pike mason, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second war wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially Britain, and the third war aimed at reducing the earth's population between half a million and a billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a preliminary project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the wealthiest family group operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and they always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that the First World War was unleashed, they destroyed the zarista Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (the wars to end the Czarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the land of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflict situation following the huge war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses. Afterwards, they were simply served by serving the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to culprits, and then building a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority to represent and represent as well the role of the fifth column, which took the flame and provoked the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the basis for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks took place in both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler pulled too much of the rope that international bankers had attached to him at first or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for accepting the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also at the international level. Let us take as an example how Israel’s supporters and detractors are split up in a huge way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice generate injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at first there was the greed of some individuals and their hunger for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who makes every effort to declare the war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, through which it passes 20 per cent of all world oil (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now shown the words that David Rockefeller delivered in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all his beings.
"And it compels all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front of him adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Film: If you get raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students took up the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlevi, who fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardised the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periployment, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping an extravagant story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan presented by the expert on "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the production society had even a real order.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits there are emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood's typical scenes are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions: men dressed who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the office halls, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his manner of action has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Friendly, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "sit" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of taking the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposter equipment at Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And they are arranged quite well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here it doesn't all go out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis happens at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track become a madness).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, appreciate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it breaks down, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real history and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services may be, is sufficient.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which presents an annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulations or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the so-called absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Up to now, women had better prices in life insurance because they were objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU’s controversial regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline obscures the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in egg prices this year.
There has been criticism of the factual prohibition of using the term "butter of butter" or the removal of the classic bulb from trade.
A quality banana must be 14 cm long.
The Union apparatus shall take this type of decision often under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "normal curves".
The European Commission argued that this only seeks to harmonise non-homogenised national standards to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive carries a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription of last year that inflatable balloons marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction on the use of matasegras by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laisez Faer, nominated, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of idea did not appear in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We call on the European Union to make compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that in our country a lot of grain was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission expressed its willingness to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended to draw up applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often a target of criticism, EU regulatory efforts, and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
Czechs are also affected by sensitive fiber, just as other countries in the Union, by the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious of these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's request, but had to change their name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemák".
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the mazapan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, there are already the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and even the variety of hops of Žatec.
As EU-protected maras, they will be proud of Pardubice's ginger bread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší's boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did it happen to be presented to the election for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't submit my application.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in our country for the past 20 years, how the thieves remain unpunished, taxes and retirement age increase.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has arrived, but soon thereafter it has been on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I needed that if I was elected Senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
To this is added the media, which despise you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists what I have been adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do so must change the law.
As President, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the driving profession will be recognized as self-employment, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from right or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for obtaining support from all parliamentary groups.
Without matching or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it rather considered a man of right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more than left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move on.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
He jokes about you being populist.
But isn't he proving it by what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of are already working in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without Parliament's support, he only has orders.
And with this it cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and to try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character who points to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take by chance the direct election of the President, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I am only a fan, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to get things over with myself, but in case it doesn't go well, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the unattainable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money either.
I don't have any money for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot valued at 25 million, an apartment valued at 10 million, another floor taxed at 8 million, a collection of works of art worth 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at 1 million, and in the account I have a couple million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evil and injustice.
Does he drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and he doesn't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my programme.
And I don't have an obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket.
The costs of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 krona a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business activity so you can live?
Didn't you say before I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I left my business.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People wanted me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live something.
How much do you usually earn on a monthly basis as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I was president, then I'd quit business.

The architecture study MVRDV shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic aspect, and at last there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "in addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go to those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam which hardly deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honour of having stood with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that is how the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, an entire master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings that are paired with cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and clung to shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises at the expected location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is complemented by underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and town buildings.
In early November, the book mount was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which so far had nothing but to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather enter a dairy center, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor collected and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upon raising the view you can see the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And all over books, books, and more books.
"Usually the book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put up the classic spatial configuration and remove the reading area from the inside outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and barandilla at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers increasingly shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on an agricultural farm in Frisian, we meet the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is cheap and efficient.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this tissue was first taken in such quantities until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquetas and their figus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment at the same time that keeps the atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe it given its large crystallized surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," Trouborst points out.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden circles located cross-sectionally on the glass façade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is the thing about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on account of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in that discipline reigns that in the specialized argot is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and unlearned it may be.
Finally, a starting point for conforming to their identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany should be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think that it supports the US position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it concerned establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still testing what their role will be, but they've already started the road towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France and Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Near East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienate from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance as it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions such as in the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance has a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to achieve a certain degree of respect.
After all, all of this has only been done to show that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the U.S. has clearly been in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American internal policy.
I believe that the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher body, but they must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is nothing easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to assume a leading role?
Or is it perhaps still hard for him to accept that leadership?
Germany has not been accustomed to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to find it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the crisis in the euro, for example, we see that whenever Germany is a leading actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Given this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European politics is decreasing, but the EU is not currently covering this vacuum, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true spouses do not file a claim.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be given the reason.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the Taylor Wessing Office specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to record their brands.
This way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive where he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is still known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of another nature. On behalf of its clients, it fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pa" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "sin" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millions, particularly in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to CLSA market analysis company data, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the one that grows at a higher rate.
However, making registrations of dubious legality in trademark registration is complicated and also a lot of money is involved.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed an application because it had passed so long that the name subject to the application had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is ill-lucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarism because the process has damaged his brand in China," says Pattloch.
This is sometimes the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a complaint against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete bombs.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, used at first a white and blue logo that reminded BMW of a great deal; the case was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitationrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and it would mean that China leads the list of new inscriptions worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, as indicated by the trademark office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure of 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid in respect of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copyist.
While the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO also rejected the use of municipalities.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg has been given reason, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
We need to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending.
Wentzler is confident that he can resolve the matter favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite part a "sum of six figures in euro" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care," Wenzler says.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
in particular if the impersonators are guaranteed rights on unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this trade area, however it has been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is "to register everything that can be protected in China too", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir and Swaziland, the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contalt, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, totter, totter and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of almost his cages by trying to put order with his strong and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years old have also arrived from the human geneticist to the home master.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorus voice has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, worldwide there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV positive.
The Voice for Africa association has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can pair a child.
This contribution will cover the school registration, the uniform and will guarantee you a hot-to-day meal at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been trying songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8,733 kilometers straight from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's inhabitants are immune-deficiency virus carriers, and dying with something over thirty years has become normal.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this recundated population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, opportunities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first, it was only the special commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally involved with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among TSEs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of adults heterosexual sexually transmitted diseases are the most common infections by chlamydia, tricomone, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hong) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
There were approximately 2,700 cases in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore they are not detected.
How can one protect?
condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer 100 per cent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections due to dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if it is frequently changed as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most TSEs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the people themselves, Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure of herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where they live and take care of children attending school every day and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook daily for over 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has made many of the people have undergone HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the apparent fact that this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficial way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel across the country and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still remember about the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent environment and much joy, but has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very well known.
"Draw near to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says the local people.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergeimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury · Global Voices
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the planet closest to the sun, there is also iced water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the zone of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like it's at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably derived from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day struck against Mercury.
No one relates the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other life components have reached other areas of the solar system.
In a completely unadvertised way for earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.

This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "born" stars.
This region of star formation, unsymmetrically called by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunglassed image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.

Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the Sagittarius constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the Ofiuco constellation, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years of the Earth the cores of two galaxies in the process of fusion are balanced towards each other to end up crashing irremediablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Nebula Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The light-yeared nebula is composed of particles of dust whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.

This star formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Nebula Roseta, new stars also arise continuously; at 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole yet there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mainly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Teas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equal to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of signals of extraterrestrial life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.

View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 it has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers are based on the fact that there is ice in the south pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no convincing evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first orbiting Mercury, now scientists are sure it is.
Drinking butter every day and live 168 years

The trip through the mountain region of Talysh could be called wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strepitude through the winding road that passes next to woody hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are located in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijani and that are very long.
Our final destiny is Lerik.
This small city boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban nuclei, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth the country enjoys thanks to Caspian sea oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what is needed to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have been over 100 years old. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of hers died at the age of 136
However, the museum's indisputable star is the shepherd of Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the older documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"She was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently, he still had time to conceive a further daughter at the age of 136.
Was Şirali Müslümov wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; most of all, there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of talyshi.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of which, besides, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 she is relatively young for what is spread through these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves tirelessly a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one of Mirzayeva's daughters, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical vases in a steamy shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the cloth hides two long dark-haired braids that your son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping at a supermarket all my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to its channel when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, has no limits.
The latter remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son is right: "In our culture the older are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression “Human rights”
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Events that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is sinking.
The future constitution, with sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, illustrated Muslims and seculars.
All of them, unremedied until now in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile because of the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend its powers "to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean by "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver that it has to do, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression over the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morale and its values".
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equal doubt is the formulation that prohibits "offense to people"
Is a President's caricature enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks in front of the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday at Tahrir del Cario Square and vowed to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up defeating," says Hamdin Sabbai, who occupies the third place on the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft of the constitution should be "in the cube of the waste of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When the referendum is called, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purified," was cited in the Egyptian media to the opposing politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it in the cry of: "The people demand the application of divine law".
They demanded Morsi to "clean the country," while proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk anything like this.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those opposed to the draft of the constitution and the supporters of it would have expressed their strong and clear views.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide which direction the country should follow in the polls.
In this respect, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human rights' doesn't even appear."
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," complains in a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The expansion of Morsi ' s powers to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolishing it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You're designing a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: is the world's most lousy fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has some connection with its greed for an extremely loathsome fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a wet, dirty football clothing mountain.
Leave him there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisite features.
I meet in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is trout in salad that gets fermented in water during, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians come to a festival that is held here in Fagernes dedicated to this food of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of a drink," says Harvard Halvarsen, a city fireman who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking a major drink of the drink.
"Some people like water more than rakfisk," says Harvard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before there was refrigeration, fish was kept during the fall immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they mainly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of Swedish inhabitants, the old rival and even makes not much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential yet quite damaging part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich costs you the cooler of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to shooting as "the event of July 22.
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth, there has been growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while she's going through rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde melena and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they did not have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet well closed.
"While we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carcassed development.
I'm in the snow doing queue to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger of garlic is certainly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that lousy fish returns.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where the merchants vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A television has connected live with a presenter who carries a bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the steam of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to take over his position, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a circle of steel has been installed from Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has achieved good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Department.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective."
Before co-coding with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
An Honest Man
In the buccolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the paved roads and full of berries that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name at the entrance of a modern sports club and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust he can make a real and lasting change," says his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, as far as security and economics are concerned, we expect the interesting and real change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
On the other side of the state, however, that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the crowded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated motorway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics from Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuse their administration of making a big eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned up," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old joke, a bully, a cheese.
What they want is for one to just accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was a governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, as prosecutors claim.
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claimed he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning in a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing carried out following the defence's request to dismiss the case as its imprisonment had been hard and that this had already claimed enough punishment, arrived one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was under arrest.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned on a maximum prison basis from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given him by the concealers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about certain issues and that the officers visiting him had talked about those problems and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they had not left a record of those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidence' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was found.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and safety for others.
"I wanted the older state to know that I was okay and (I wanted to) stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Navy base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning stated that once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a hemp, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming out pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the janitors couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on the treatment Manning received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in his statement on Thursday, according to which, after having been forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of the lockers and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the counting.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he deduced by the order given to him by the locker that should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his hemp to self-injury but that he had not.
Manning testified that night they had taken off his cell his underwear, his chanchlas and his glasses.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he spent during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted on the war council, which is expected to start early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to have Manning found guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has claimed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application for all detainees who are in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully provoking the publication of information on the Internet, filtering information from the national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had hardly gone down the plain and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicoans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, all my life, I've been called a Mexican.
It's ethnic tachograph, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
Later, I decided to "Mexico-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, tachographing or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that time this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as long as the leaders of these two countries meet together, there was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at a time when a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma set themselves up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point on our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or any of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunity was closed in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our bonds with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more strongly who they are and the second that bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico you see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I found out during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and press the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna keep them alone with this idea, guys.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented for how they treated their relatives much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the futile and usual discussions about who started first, many buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
Arab spring has left all the pieces they like or don't like, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional boom.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal dead-point situation could be unleashed.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire was maintained on 21 November, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the world, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing out for them.
Since Islamists have gained influence all over the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The glaring members of Hamas say that the Islamist half moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulá militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brothers, on the other hand, are Hamas' cousins and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will arise as the protagonist to whom it cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the contrary conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have placed Hamas on their site.
Israel's anti-missile system of Iron Summit has proved its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States stands firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the barrier that the West Bank is taking, the main piece of an aspirant territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the illegality of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman during the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pampering these Palestinian twists by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets as well as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
Better keep them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they lift their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area would hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that calls for sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's assignment of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the people who are struggling for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status in the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office he failed to submit his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on boxes of a green black, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and the colors of the brands with an envelope of an olive green black, amazing images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small source type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government states that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trust studies showing that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said federal health minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the crown logo to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not have much impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that the counterfeiters will bring from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited from the approval of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for scraps and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been shot almost two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law at the Supreme Court of Australia.
She stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sponsoring sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews on brands from "foot-to-foot citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth asking whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulations require than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I just don't listen."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Surely, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in the centre of Sydney, indicates that the uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to put them in the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unwind a delivery; now I'm four," says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it's already, okay, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands upwards.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to bore a little
During this year's Thanksgiving party, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying suffered from a mechanical problem and we had to wait until another plane arrived.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
To spend half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free shops.
But more and more scholars and experts in child development praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both us and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good spirit?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, says, and author of the book "Boredom: A Livey History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom that dates back to the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and presenting the idea to a panel of discussion consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but unable, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boring can sound awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that they have the problem.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Uninvolved Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which the participants heard a tape from a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a TV program on every volume that kept no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the low volume program showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we currently know that moving or doing garabads, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a film that is particularly boring.
But some people tend to get more bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers in the 1980s developed a "flight trend scale."
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get more bored than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said he would get bored while he was at school or doing his homework, while 23 percent said he would get bored when he was not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they'd get bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest quotas," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, coming back to my question from the beginning: is it good to bore?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way your brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to do so applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to bore ourselves more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worth it," he says.
Notice that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and football institute in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related articles (minor crimes each involving a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes due to drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes by possession of marijuana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure has been adopted.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving on with the cases open for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of newly authorized marijuana stores in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licenses; all this before the deadline arrives on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado is ahead of most states regarding the regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model," he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition on cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the legal cannabis centre, a newly created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would cease to bring court proceedings due to minor cases of marijuana possession to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to file charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's regulations that regulate marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring judicial proceedings against those offences that occurred at the time they were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney of the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time keeping the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier to district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for the possession of marijuana and is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marihuana Act.
"They've been taking people to court so long that they can't really accept it as legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become testing cases at the national level in terms of the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
The advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite some outstanding arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has largely allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to pull down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow state-controlled shops to sell marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an Obama administration's drug policy exaggerator.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the town hall.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted for in favour of what the state voted for."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory."
You don't attack university students because of their views just now
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming about getting a seat at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of occupying my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of history, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had left because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in uncooked cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yeah, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
They harassed me for one reason only, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they wonder what that comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right- center students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party is such at Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights that homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities have.
Conservative members of the JCR (grad student group) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously, personally attacked and treated as non-grateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC documentary2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and Right) on student politics and presenting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" for the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing tendency of left-wings in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 and the elected president of OUCA, says that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are from the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, she was an extremely shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after the cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The environment would have frightened any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students met and met the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that not only did the professors look hard at the ridicule of conservative university students, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of miners strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the workshop's wooden rooms.
The first one to attend was to translate 18th-century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one.
Pitt, a low-faced man who looked like a biscocho mass, knew well how to eject bad bile.
"Is that whatcherists refuse to learn French or is that they are simply fools?" he asked.
The other colleges laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to hold.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt said.
I came back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as an OAUCA member.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They're messing with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly to conceal.
I insisted that you didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other, didn't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after nightfall?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for not only being the Conservative party, but also assisting Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it to be provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I started to travel from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my most open-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear sleeping needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
Her painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you let it go."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his belief.
The following week, during a seminary where another professor of history had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old."
The truce lasted only a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
By then my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was in a frightened state and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When I left the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but is now hiding behind a reputation that is not worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of the Costura", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high seam dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the messy and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most grenade of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: of humble modist of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off the collars of their eyebrows on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their villa in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, playing a Valentine's Day
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charism of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on her floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each guest made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costura Week in Paris in 1995.
"It never happens to be fashionable because its designs are works of art," it ends.
Alkaline Display
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions, but of well-suited love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade through the gateway to contemplate a dream "audience" that lights up Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumer who used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this mannequin audience, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modisto, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "not forgotten."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Fairy.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampo can not forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and having the chance to wear one of your night costumes...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirts, "corsage" flagged and listened to a word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashionist party dresses with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories she brings."
The "king" of fashion
The grand end of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume with Pablo from Greece in 1995.
It took four months to work and 25 "girlfriends" (as the modist calls their seams) to develop this ivory silk suit with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnobled for years with the elite's "being-being," Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calm, his pure and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time didn't pass to him."
If a princess says so...
The world's hardest trade: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another that literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the earth’s bowels is solidified when you come in contact with the air.
After removing large sulphur rocks, which total reach about 70 kilograms, it carries them in two bamboo baskets that carry on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the exhausting carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb by turtle step, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall through the cliff.
They know that any transpire could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who spent years ago on the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro per kilo of sulphur that they extract
Once above, they take a step between tourists photographing them as circus monkeys and, carrying the heavy baskets fatigue, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euro) per kilo of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture waxes, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilograms, we take some 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily doors.
It takes three hours for each and it gets wet, but it allows you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would earn in the field.
"The miners' newspaper is very high here, where coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (EUR 1,2 euros) on the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", explains the carrier, who used to work as a masonry on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the coffin wasn't as hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as the sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and brought her to Java to become Islam."
Then he has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly and his eyes get irritated by toxic gases
At age 27, Anto has been playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass her bill despite covering her face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden cabin with other carriers, he rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop eating at night, when his characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater lighting with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs nor provides any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and so on the weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) charge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years of age.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and blinds the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and sores in the shoulders, which have been corrupted by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket over your back, Unainik can now only charge 50 pounds to 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions take 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat's path between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the 30-year-old, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's hardest trades: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and cost of property and education for having no children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video turned viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a boulder in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, has the hope that with the advertisement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill their "national duty".
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst people in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was something we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do our best to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
What is not taken so lightly is the Singapore government.
Spending $1.300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was over 2 - known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says that it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the population's decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia is barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surface areas of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, to whom they were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man about 20 years old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babymaking, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of private or "the area of private life that is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social networks?
Do you understand the dangers that you are exposed to by ventilating on the Internet situations that would probably not share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not go up to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been accounting for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," he says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who's making the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that obscene photographs, naked persons, crimes or humiliating or violent comments are mispublished.
Jorge ensures to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just raise them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to answer that you would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the added people on his friend list.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or phone number.
"If you push me or you just demand my bills," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of one of my friends was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the bill.
"Just put her privacy."
Then it explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
If I do, if I get hurt or I want to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, came up with these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We're the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we're still learning," he says.
He comments that the theme is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disseminated, published or told at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Also they are selective when what they care most about is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them see that they should act online as they do it off-line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential for family parents to read social media policies.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children of the lesson of "not talk to strangers."
Ends the Unasur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Ef tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency pointed out at an early stage that would be delivered after the closure, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, for a few brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only the audio video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is the Humala statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru hosted the Third Arab South American Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite the press' insistent demands, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated.
On ASPA's official website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were safe transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional appointment and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will act and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean partner.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," said Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that the ICJ will be submitted to occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the inattentives of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011, after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after the noon of Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements".
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-priced Internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by going to our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombia's president Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he was hoping to meet with his Nicaraguan partner, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"Let's go over all these paths, they're not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc defence ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal where "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In that regard, he defended the plan to establish South American citizenship to encourage the Unasur member countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give a chair never commit themselves to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," said Ecuador's founder, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he is not sorry about that decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be subjected to interrogation in his territory for a alleged sexual offence when "Swedish law itself allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," Ecuadorian deputy said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are confined to a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a lifeline that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution in the hands of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is doing a number of procedures at different European levels," he said.
And he thought that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this ends."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly permits its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow, this problem ends.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and nuanced that what does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer "the bankers or the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate Ecuador", and that if they are re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legalism" because it actually "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between both countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that judgement is not accepted.
It's a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute in the same court of Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international authorities if the two countries undertake to accept judgement as hard as it is".
With reference to the possibility of being a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, for we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and we get out of public life.
If we lose anyway.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have just spoken to Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the outcome of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he said, recalling the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more smooth", without obvious success.
The boy hid him from his family.
She decided to take care of her illness alone and began to inform herself about her; with such a commitment that she had already celebrated her birthday 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of his illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 and 50 years count, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that one who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while kept in control he can live without problems up to the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To scale this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, so it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't had the problem with medication. The problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their condition of infection, i.e., at late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong data: "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make early diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer mass detection tests to all those who require it."
Specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida) agree in their proposal, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated by a friend and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS phase and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die already, I'd better get back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the drugs.
To date, her parents only know that she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but responsible, I care for myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
If they were at risk, if they knew sooner or later whether they were HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle slogan for AIDS this 2012.
Condones behind counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a covert journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "there has indeed been an increase in the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are who today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with surna and value judgments of social workers, school guidance workers, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, assured the communicator.
It proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the exhibitors and these 100 are found in public bathroom dispatchers from the sites that young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them scissors and motels, as Governor Emilio González replied, when asked if there would be condoms in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases accumulated (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since there are 4 to 5 people in one case who do not know.
Ratified by an appeal court in the United States a judgment which does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a mercantile competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that survival procedures for signatures that permit Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, as opposed to international conventions.
In the practical field, the backlog of the judgment issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Banking for the North District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties in coaching the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors should be governed by the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the mercantile competition in Mexico.
The first point would involve not knowing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnationally profiled companies.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created and the American Law Institute was appointed as referee.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the inter-companies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the trade contest the debts held by the Vitro subsidiaries with their matrice, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case to accept the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-companies debts supported the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
In addition, the fact is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, however, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, i.e. the "goodre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 on the ground of the severe economic crisis that he faced in the United States, beating the country's collections.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appellate court itself for the vote to be taken to the full, that is, the five judges, since only three were voted.
If it does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare, which requires the review of the case by a higher instance, will be sought in this case by the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court suspended a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that it was released with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match it with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, namely the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carabola: they hit Vitro and beat the country.
General Balance
For several months the complaints lodged at the table by Mexican Aviation Unions against the former company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Union of Aviation Pilots already found the bottle neck.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank trust F/589 IXE, on behalf of Mexican aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mars.
Meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society generally approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sales and distribution towards Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra had previously managed to unify the governors of the south-east to oppose the monumental thing that swept away with part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the Amazons against industry.
ACTA died
Soslayed by the government a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Commercial Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the archives.
As you know, action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, home developer Homex is placing on the market Stock Certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive Birth

Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos del basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years attached to the board sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, a national basketball player, taken over and leading in the BSN with the Bayamón Cows or President of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive trajectory, thus attesting.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who remember their passage through the Cows from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of age as a co-powered or taken over from the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a takeover, a co-powered or a leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong player, 6"7" height.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's principle, one of the best players Puerto Rico's ever had.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, since by 1988 it was already a federative mandalas.
For that time I preferred to enjoy their executions and Mincy's on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the pre-olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth place and it must have been bronze not to be by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a hair to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one we won the bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young people, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in 90 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the one of the 1995 Preolympian in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the mess of the Silver Sea Pan American, we win gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best boric leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, officers and arbitrators.
That's nice to meet you.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dead
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world-famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the "Dallas" television series, in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace in Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss you very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were short-time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work at the cinema included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the charmingly hateful J.R. that led Hagman to his highest star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
He also helped to give the series a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and converted to "Dallas" in the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with cheating as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone " huge, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in process, reported the chain.
There was immediately no pronouncement by Warner or TNT on how Hagman's loss will handle the series.
Born from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who stellarized classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was married to counsel Ben Hagman in 1931.
He tried his luck in New York theaters early in the 1950 ’ s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," she said to the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation he became a organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearsome patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you're gonna be okay."
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible anchor: The end of the "long regressive account" of the May Calendar, December 21, to which many people have been held as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he was expecting in the next couple of months: Hurricane Cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dede-darmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theologians of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could blow up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vaker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option of giving the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night as the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He got tired in two hours," Restall said about his course for high average students, who filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who were wondering if there was any more.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and somehow discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, 21-year-old West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
"On other places people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to see that December 21 is the beginning of a period of seven years after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they thought they were going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
