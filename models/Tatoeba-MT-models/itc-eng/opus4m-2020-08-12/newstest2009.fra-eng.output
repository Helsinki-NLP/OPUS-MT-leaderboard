At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange in the negative
After Tuesday morning's fall, Prague's scholarship rectifies its losses.
Transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall of the day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives, which refuses to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is also noticeable in us.
Action fall in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the signs succeeded in eliminating some of the losses during the day.
Hongkong’s Hang Seng Stock Index lost four percent during the trade, but later it cleared up some of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movements of the Hongkong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the US rescue action will affect the financial markets around the world," observes Joseph Yam, head of Hongkong's monetary office.
Although Hongkong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries might be affected.
The bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (near 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus waived the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. shares live on Monday, a blood bath and the main indices of actions were the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, having experienced such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was falling free.
Congress ceda: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the American financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 billion kroner) financial assistance granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Indeed, before the final version of the Act can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Sunday at Reuters Barney Frank, the president of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate at the earliest Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which aid to markets can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on the form in which the package of measures for the stabilization of the market should take," entrusts the Agency Bloomberg to the Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday night in Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
The latter should buy from financial companies the intangible real estate assets that cause financial enterprises to lose significantly and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid was not missing, the legislators made the Congress a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to reassure investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect trade on Monday.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, or if negotiations do not risk being blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there are still many changes in the law.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush had hoped, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if the Congress feels that the programme does not perform its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first 100 billion dollars, then, to finish, 350 billion dollars.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may put his veto on this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to make him a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, of which the value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed to the vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of Golden Parachutes
The President of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the reduction agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will monitor the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides support for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new bills in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the debtor's monthly payments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Aid
According to the economist leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of the repurchase of the problem assets.
This will be crucial to deal with the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, as important as that.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," stresses Marek.
An extreme push: MP3 players against mobiles.
You will be advised, how to choose
While almost all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
There is no shortage of reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap high-end gramphone to put the new Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disk, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stuffed vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramphone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand krona on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty holding listeners purchased for twenty krona on the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of the batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than simply reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Alongside the first functions, phone calls and texting, he is able to read music and movies, record them, he has a variable quality camera and can, for example, serve to navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two refills will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy wastes.
Mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are much more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count on them playing music for only a few hours.
If, in addition, you have to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second charge for the job - this being even valid for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to take themselves without a reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software except iPod.
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified by the name of the performer, the title of the album, style, or then by the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index that has a tree structure, in the way of Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, be particularly interested in the lifespan of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of output of the sound and, of course, the ease of the order.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3.
Virtually all the mobiles are now capable of them.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is capable of reading.
Everyone gets to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also read WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit the corresponding web pages (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question from the mobile phone.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for obtaining a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, operators' offer is miserable and, in most cases, it is limited to fast-made tubes.
The prices are not even the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either via GSM, the Internet or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motive on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which have almost all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive normally costs less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand kroner, we can have a walkman already very convenient.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone comes to order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramphone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding auditors, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the command is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win Czechia this year itself.
Maybe
The mobile market in Chechnya is relatively advanced, our operators offering practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't miss it for long.
We have already repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
ČTÚ (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our homes than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulating roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Chechnya remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that there is no longer room for another operator in Chechnya, makes a chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network seems to have no more chance (in fact, now he would find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable decrease in prices, which should subsequently also respond to conventional operators.
However, even before the entry of the riots such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today in our homes were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to earn more than 100 thousand customers and become the country's fifth operator.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has among other things the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they actually need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
In this way, in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as expensive in Britain as its competitors.
But, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, targeting an unusual target group can also be a good publicity blow.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator that they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could also work at home.
Miroslav Čepický, vodafone's spokesperson, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
All the more so as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In Chechnya, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but in Chechnya negotiations are not very supportive.
Rather, the launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It therefore indirectly confirmed that the operators in Chechnya were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best so that a potential competitor may not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the area of business customers, does not hide, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We tend to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile.
And the sooner it'll be the best.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations," said the spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So the future is perhaps promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not think there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
At the moment, no topic with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vladimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's spokesperson states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered for the viable and bilaterally advantageous project now, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone rather directs its attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, we believe, means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The mobile operators' approach is easily understandable, another operator's entry would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So how can we facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to feel like fair larrons. The Chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies.
The most apparent pressure on the U:fon was the one exercised by the T-Mobile company at the time of the creation of the U:fon.
This shows information that is accessible to the public from the websites of ČTÚ.
Today, the U:fon is willing to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "Competition on the mobile market has also recently been enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulatory bodies seems to be disconcerting.
However, it is not only the attitude of ČTU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in the economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the time being, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, the UUOHS Department of External Relations.
Such a statement would not surprise operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers, and on the other hand also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of an honest functioning of the market and a decrease in prices does not appear to be part of the UOHS' interests.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, naturally arises.
Similarly, a strictly identical price of gasoline for all service stations is likely to be due to the chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not identified signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none of them have an increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the Telecommunication Regulator," said Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts propose another view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at all times.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators proceed visibly in a similar way.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Restoring responsibility on the ČTU is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the UOHS washes its hands.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce the recent development of the Telecommunications Act, an expansion of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
However, the UOHS representatives must know very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
That said, the operation of some kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
In most cases, companies are involved in multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are provided, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elected persons.
The magic tower consists of the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client, it obtains special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you're talking about happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the society in question," responded to our question regarding this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity would not have reached the task of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, they may be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, decides against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card on their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the way of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
This is precisely what should seem strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, there is another question in UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the operators' explanations, which claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbidding it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times before, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, practically in all the countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies have intervened in developed countries, which were defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the way a hot potato is being disposed of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more beneficial to them.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the cognane.
If the flow information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will be unable only to remain impassable in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on Czech nationality day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the Kde dosov national anthem (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was recorded again by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jérémieáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek views Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that both singers and the choir had a good saying, so that we could understand the words well, that they sang simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate, next year, its 175th anniversary.
The Kde domov song was first played in 1834 on the stavovské divadlo boards (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously made it appropriate.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anmne sound
Freight transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoise Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will ride the subway, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible for about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (the coupon will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it recorded on their credit card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located at the Metro Stations Museum, MČstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons via the Internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can permanently forget the windows in the metro stations, where they had to track impatience in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and will register it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff, which will help those interested with the purchase via the internet and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovicá, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
Automatics that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously purchased will save itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
In the peri-urban trains and the 300 to 499 bus lines, mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohème to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (Integrated Prague transports), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of transport in common pragois.
Periurban buses are equipped with readers of maps integrated with the driver's box.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, may again join the automatic distributors, initially used to record coupons on the map.
That is where the information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the device screen.
The Sudets were calling for a referendum in the USA.
The Germans of the South asked in 1945 for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohème).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of South Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This comes from, among other things, a preserved letter in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter ask the American President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemian territory) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation very well and we want to be very sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is at the heart."
Given that the association with Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, disrespectful attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and bondage, the authors of the letter urge the American President to take into his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would give this territory to a foreign state to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that did not at all contribute to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the fourth million inhabitants," the letter says.
The alleged reason the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the Germans' opinion of Šumava, he would have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of the post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudets of the day.
While the Czech Germans had to at least find out that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them had such an opportunity.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed this.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region's catch camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that he would be expelled from the Republic following decrees Beneš.
Don’t think about it!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that is intended to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The Minister Aleš's office is of the opinion that it will discourage drivers from conducting dangerous behaviour on the wheel.
This campaign costs 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol at the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don’t think about it!
The phrase "You don't think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a flow of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of attention.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen with dramatic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will result in a decrease in the incidence of accidents and in the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at the hospital Na Homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, says the psychologist.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, supported the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all of them," said Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not happen," he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places" located within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
Withdrawal of the heights of the Golan
Olmert also supported Israel's retirement from the Golan Heights, which he believed was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retirement from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite Movement); they will have to give up their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite Movement), Al-Kaïda (the terrorist network), as well as that of Djihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the company's bus Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises if the attendants and passengers can travel within the bus.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally observed, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostesse died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The girl was at this point unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the bus may have an accident or even brake in a sudden way, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is by virtue of its technical record equipped with standing spaces or not.
If this standing position equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency have no standing places; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the company director Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we dealt with with with the department and, at first, it prohibits any passenger movement.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no univocal legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka spokesperson with greater ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the director of the road traffic department, believes that the law deals with the problem sufficiently.
"Everything depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing places in its approval.
Everything is in there," he says.
The buses are divided into urban spaces, where there are standing spaces and a limited maximum speed, long-distance with standing spaces and higher authorized speed and long-distance buses without standing with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (safety of road traffic) in transport, does not see the movement of the escorts on board as a major problem.
"In a regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on planes.
There, too, it's not safe when there's a turbulence and the hostess of the air can form its head."
"Or, in the event that the bus would have brake sharply, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the security of the stewardess by means of internal requirements," he said, and also felt that from the point of view of the law, the problem was not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their business as a risky business.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I'll delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and logbook on board.
This would also reduce the costs," he said.
Security concerns are the reason given to the absence of escorts in its vehicles by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hosts. We have opposed them since the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has come
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a blinker and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he rubbed it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the yards were sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for the financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment of the law, which has been developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of the escorts on board the bus.
"Or, she did not reach any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and in the use of the mobile on the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardess as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Hanselka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the control of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The main words did not fail in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
From a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be established, according to the public mail Monday.
The WestLB would provide a "competent block" with sustainable productivity in such a case.
In short, such a relationship could be the decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee tries to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority which has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, who knew the Sparkasse customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Of course, the Chief of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced at the presentation of the figures in the late August six months that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported and by the banks of the Länder and the savings-cassette groupings, commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the financial market flow, or parts thereof.
The talks, however, have only just begun, we say in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers on the financial place in Frankfurt, comes into play on the issue of consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed that Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Palatinat and the Halbab.
Nothing, however, came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse was speaking against any involvement of Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not join.
The bank of the Land of Rhénie Palatinat was linked to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new talks on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, acted against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bade-Wuttenberg Land bank could come true at first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers was to increase, potential partners would gradually escape.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The group of Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, has, on the other hand, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain strict.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, which is the commercial model of the future capacity of the banks of the Länder, had not been resolved by the German group of savings and transfers.
In the end, a parting of the WestLb could take place, a patching which is obviously not desired here.
This is also discussed in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' would be targeted for the institution.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a ton of five liters of beer from the brand Kaiser, stands a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds its dog can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nouveau train station, four buses take departure tonight at 23h45, 'destination Monaco, party della beer', expected arrival at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, on one of the buses travelling Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat of false fur and large silver-mounted glasses.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing but this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 22.30.
spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco has taken a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive at night on the Autostrada direction `Brennerero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates once again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When early in the morning, Marco's group finally arrived at six thirty as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First: get dressed in the little yellow cap.
On it is written on the left `Beer party', in gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscensiviando.it'.
Second: `When the doors of the beer chapter are opened, it is short', shouts Marco in the morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve the spaces at the bottom of the tent.
`Don't go ahead, or we're stuck, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, raise Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the order!
`Show the security agents that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This evening, come back here at ten and a half hours!' Understand?
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
On the way, someone new from yellow tree caps to find the way, signs and even an election poster from a large Bavarian popular party.
We tend to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of Italians'.
There are no specific figures; 50 000 people are talking about starting through the Alps and falling into the beer stand, 10 percent of the visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police is strengthened by seven Southern Tyrolese police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross that carries out statistics on countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for the shareholders of Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used to use the word 'relatively' and to slip that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This happened this weekend.
The financial of the Bavarian real estate Hippo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains a German bank consortium a credit of one billion to protect itself from turbulence from markets.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hippo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter company supports the losses.
The state finance had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced very short-term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to €2.37 million, and the own capital rate had also decreased slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period in the previous year, the profits from the allocation of debt and determined securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of gains of around 16 percent has been moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state finance had at first mischaracterized on real estate industrial credits, which had subsequently been affiliated with the Aerail bank.
Because classical state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the child company, the Hippo Real Estate must make depreciations that should have on the calculation of the Group's gains and losses an essential material effect that remains still quite blurry.
The fact is that dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hippo Real Estate has been a state investor and highly important infrastructure since the purchase of the Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the inter-bank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks was again considerably short, banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about 50 billion euros - of all the Depfa credits of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement by the Hippo Real Estate, the group's need for funding is covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of widely out-of-date international financial markets.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds up to the end of 2009.
The Chair of HRE Georg Funke's Steering Committee explained, on the other hand, that the Hippo Real Estate group should no longer have to use medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institution (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Royal Hypo Group in the market is now secured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors only have to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and the imposition of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Furthermore, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used throughout its scope.
But neither can the opposite be avoided.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the doors of insolvency on Sunday evenings, this rescue for the least interim will not succeed in reassureing the spirits either.
The share rate fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
Bond courses, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the first-leading debts have hardly moved, the second-plan loans prices drop.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hippo and those of course that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hippo Real Estate bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, there can be a resorption of the backlog over time.
Or what no one can hope for at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching certainty has now become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve insomnia nights first of all to long-term creditors on the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn on to be a deferral of losses for the next few years on the next tax on the incomes of the automatically withdrawn stock capital gains.
Sylvana and the box secrets in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to meet for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already on my way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I've had to find the way alone, I'm glad I didn't lose.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as at home in Basse-Saxe.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until at nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet had the school uniform, I put on an old coat of my mother-in-home, as well as a shirt, blue-mounted socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I came before the desk, and tried to pronounce it correctly: 'Soyonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong sounded, I was tested in the rules.
Everyone spoke to those who were better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My mother-in-home had also done this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German cases.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a concave salad and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe salty plums confesses, brorr!
Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl sometimes offers a boy a Bento that she herself has prepared, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope that she can do a little better the boy's knowledge during the break.
I read this in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
'Cause I'm fascinated by what?
Finally, reading sleeves, that's what I've been preferin' for years.
And in order to better understand the mangoes and the culture that is there, at one point, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak for traditions, habits and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a safe escape in the face of danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how could it be verified that he experiences the same thing when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think you are true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult terrains because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, escape or attack.
Human beings behave the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective life.
However, I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective life to that of the animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the Prefrontal Side Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and management and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depends on the Prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant characteristic could be the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on him.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its form, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessed scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term memory studies of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the Prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result of the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we describe as "danger" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, like the reactions of the body) captures the living memory.
As a result, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially the Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than on ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of body sensation of the Cortex and brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be undisputed.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in men and rats is probably also felt as it is in both cases: how could one verify if rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar manner?
A safe escape from danger, but if he's afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not sufficient to prove the same experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, but the cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for Man: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cafards (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress has been made to the nervous level to the extent that the same is assessed in rats and in humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly squeezing against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has constantly been watching us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The Polish PZPN football league management was suspended by the National Olympic Committee following numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki from the Polish press agency PAP.
"We assured the President of the UEFA in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already sentenced for mandatory relegation handling in the previous season; ultimately, the beginning of the League had to be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignified counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adulterin Dennis Quaid.
It echoes - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose War for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a gruesome battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed himself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis had been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is told in the history of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his characterization as an unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrous," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg will once again heal the history of our relationship and manipulate it".
It would be even more "reproachable", that "the pain and disturbances that lead to a divorce for each child should be revived again in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So it was his answer to the scratch: "In any case, my life continues.
I am happy to have a wonderful family that goes well."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
The flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express financial and travel services.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this were for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "desir of downturned travel of American tourists".
Financial positions such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are maintained with an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
As well as the price of flights, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the economic class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of the tickets in the economic class dropped by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the business class and in the first class, however, the price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this drop in prices would be on the one hand slow economic growth, explains the firm.
The demand would fall from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-rentable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the rankings.
In the Bourussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find an 11 functional.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player was only late in the game and his shot was failing the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whistle in the lobby of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much going on in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over, and most of them were satisfied in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his application was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumbs to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second purpose!
The implementation has failed.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sweeted to be more relaxed as well."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit of the head succeeded by Mladen Petri (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak gladbach players could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"That was a dirty victory," Marin Jol said.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
By Saturday afternoon, the supporters were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a fall," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-engaged arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen found out from FC Bayern - certainly forms slowly, but it does not yet shine.
"We need more charm and more dribble," Jol demanded.

As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage paper.
However, the amount should not be paid once but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial corporation that may be exchanged in relation to the course evolution in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Because of soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for many years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
The probes become faster or slower in an unexpected manner.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him with the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes it's as hard as making Einstein not wrong and trying to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It seems to emanate from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientific calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese raiders had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what has been shared by Egyptian state television, Arab Al-Arabija television and the Italian media.
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants in the wilderness should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of hostages remain still unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, as said by an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without screaming station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
There was nothing left but gathering hostages, when suddenly this "surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had shot down on Sunday six of the raiders in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money had to be given by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the liberation of hostages took a delay because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to free women's hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the raiders found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who leads to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after he had admitted eight counts of charges for unfair cases.
The High Court of Truro referred to his daughter-in-law Stéphanie Randle as a regular link between her daughter-in-law from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had attached her and had been ganged up before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
However, the court was informed that Miss Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and a cyclist, had seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father who had written a letter of confession that ended with this: "I regularly attached her and the bandadis".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This dismal saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if she had not done this gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I especially emphasize, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet Departmental Officer who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be sentenced by the Office Secrets Act to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents passed into the BBC's hands before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguard of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies against the B&B bill.
British building companies could have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savings.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings money, including 59 buildings.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time will be owed annually to the 700 financial companies that harvest deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have behaved prudently... must now pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each corporation must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it owns, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will be in 2009 at £450million.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Corporations Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have behaved prudently when the real estate market is resumed now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"we need to examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the construction companies and their members paying this salt bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the entire year will have to be paid, which could actually double.
Since the buildings are non-shared organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
Jersey people must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of her milk, from five pennies per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-penny increase in February, and follows a search by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they will, in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had changed for the last time, in 2002.
A former Bangladeshi PM has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said that the court refused to give him his bail because of his examination for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's usual rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in a few weeks' time, but her party, the League Awani, demanded that the country's interim military government first give her full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of his release are contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why he could not remain free on his return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges they are subjected to.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-police campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign last week in all six provinces.
But she says she is not able to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its trial following the judgment of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's participation had in the past prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Bureau of the Fair Trading reported that the purchase by BSkyB, shares of ITV raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB told her that forcing her to reduce her ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary it was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors' case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of the White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecution Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, which are not well founded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his main recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At that time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed due to poor benefits.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more critical than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to give these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting the courts for the government.
It is certain that they may be fired at any time, but cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered it "the first responsible" of these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader, "remarkably succeeding not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of not being able to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly leaves
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, standing at the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heartbeat became irregular, after he collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Maybe Soon for Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No sign indicates the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to revive Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the pastry house.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Committees of Neighbourhood Owners, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to rebuild the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a café to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that while society wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to re-look this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing also that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned since.
The later entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo covered by Ramones' album " Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, vests, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareness - a virtual piece identical to the city that should be placed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York ( titled "The Book of Answers: A Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small ass-sack narrow, dark day and night, and bound by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers last week that fly along the droplets."
A few exceptions, the street always has the same look.
A rat splintered at the bottom of the alley, near a door that used to lead to CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of empty 22 ounces beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby said they only rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he believed that some underestimated street attraction in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been carried out in dark, wet and disgusting places."
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you thought. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."This is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education programme particularly supports among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends instruction in language classes other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school east of Los Angeles County.
Students at this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of the students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Of the CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 math state exam, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English language exam of arts
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, says Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total English immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"It works, she observes, "it worked for us"
Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure Mr. Obama's prognosis.
Although it is in favour of the fact that immigrants are learning English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than dedign them or consider them insignificant.
Drop Nette of Petroleum as a result of the New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices have fallen significantly on Monday, as people fear that the financial market rescue plan will not be able to bring the economy back to life.
The end operations of crude oil fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. New York's Mercantile Stock Exchange, at this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having experienced an increase of $145,29 per barrel in July, prices dropped to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding to the profound uncertainties of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the greatest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, said the government this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments in part nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement" appear to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"With regard to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the US virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the declines in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Party Determining for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played salt under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an after noon during which their relationship made a bond forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first one when a corner back fell and the second one, 10 seconds from the middle time.
"I didn't leave my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense beat the cardinals' quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could have marked in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third time?"
When we told him both- the Jets left 21 unquestionable points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebslelassie rested, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebslelassie, Ethiopian, again proved worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, having beaten his own record of the world at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the plate, Gebslassie beat 27 seconds its record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrslassie won the 26th record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebslelassie had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - it may be too much in today's eyes, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at departure, 55 degrees at arrival- Gebslassia won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The racers like Gebslelassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last decade, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebslassie told reporters, had suffered cramps two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is clear that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I gave myself up last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was accused, above all, in Kenya, that the rival is African of Ethiopia - having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a race track, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebslassia's capabilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebslelassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebslelassia after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the arrival, Gebslelassie made its final climb to stand out from Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improving its best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the games in Beijing because of a hypothetical bad back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a good advantage, then passing them about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Orgueil and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where pride and complications of African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black town to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today."The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes - has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's missing."
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign look.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, resident for ever and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it must be in conformity with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a takeover of blacks and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of Southist rural culture - some times it has been denounced, some times it has been acclaimed - which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her birthplace worldwide through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a large cashier in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"pass the road on the left," she writes, "you'll find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds and everything that can be used for passersby.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, tanning, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalized, quoting colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston used to arrive in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were mocking her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he added, swinging in his chair of the back patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long".
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to cross a highway to five roads in town, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, the main street to two roads in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just returning from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mix dispute led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"At that time, a band of young whites came to throw oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They launched a pastry from their car" .
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glamorous of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"the black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as head of the Rescue of Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because it's white," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went beyond the damage, such as it, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The motorway project arrived just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbours of Hurston regard her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the container rejected the proposal of the motorway.
"The five-way highway fiasco, which is extremely fast, is a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A single-themed library (of course referred to as Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, resurrected.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a rear street after a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( 90 percent today are black)
Foreigners who have come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for the bright red, are still afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston as his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, no better or worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed with other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is a great deal of sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday's Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to look at history, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and giant TV screens at Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass and bee offices above their head, bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst day working at the office" since 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to fall on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffin plates for morning meetings.
Latinos still drag between residential buildings bearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke arranged on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to race to buy their morning sandwiches to walkers, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 7 o'clock a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I found out at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people queued.
Not in front of the cashier's windows, neither to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where regular customers ordered their checkups, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new clients opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all tailing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the savings accounts called Thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that only work in a state, and who claim to treat clients as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, used the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend and Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, on account of a value of $440 million, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debank, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her lean CEO Dick Full, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria swings right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating rubbed red mosques.
The police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves have been seriously damaged at the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is a organized action by the police.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of hatred of extremists toward Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somewhat related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that reaches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that have rallied almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties seek to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out right after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamorous, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to travel to Spain through France to the authorities under his control.
The Police in Kent had given this ban to travel last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the court hearing in the limited jurisdiction of Ashford, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said "Tuesday, 25 September, at the Ashford court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered on the list of sexual abusers.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his scheduled departure.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police said she would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter movements in the container.
A spokesman for Kent's Police said, "Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"in our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most expensive intention to the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years old, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and were therefore forced to depart to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, was going to the Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for the possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no outer garments.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen glances of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month programming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't need to take pictures on stage.
They have a unique personality and character.
What interests me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personalities of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "People's Song of Mines", Bauer began a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remind the classic photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not dance or singing in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captured the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic was the constant of this work presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a gallery portrait collection book.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a moment or less long.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're standing in front of people, characters you don't know, or they just leave you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of rue de la Mata (the road parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "very bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who passed through the Amazon.
The favourite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday to the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real daring" and that "everyone demonstrates that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw parade in the aqueduct city about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants' voices, made a full room at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, faced a fascinating audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his desire to read" and "live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical way" through intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to cope with his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no means" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said it has "effects" and "makes people less like", because the writers were asked "to not let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco's fair
The flag party that concluded the bulls' races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toasters had verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hit this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who had to face in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The afternoon itself Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the steps discovered applauded more than his own fight with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he got whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Basque Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants with a van and the latter two undertake the escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashisch, to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and of falsifying documents.
The incident took place when various officials from the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control over the N-1 at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver broke orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further down the coast, where the two occupants had come down to escape into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, a Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons, and then they transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to carry out the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey map of the van, and that is why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsifying documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who has managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old inmate, A.A.J., was cautioned to carry out the various steps and will be tried within the following hours.
Actor Heather Locklear arrested for driving with the effect of a drug
Actor Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson from the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness said that about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was leaning heavily on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and moving back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at this point, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was shunned from the outset, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion that he had been driving under the influence of a substance that had not been specified and was imprisoned about 1900 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat a nervous breakdown.
Callazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the Left United to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva
The Coordinator General and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today said that it was the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making benefits to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the conduct of the political party that he will have to adopt on the city council in Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all public servants".
"Blood of Mayo", the dared bet of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de May", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried to "show the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours," Sangre de May » will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci makes sure that with this film "a child dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to play a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2nd May Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been deceived as a leader in the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding like for the films "Capitaine Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Back to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the scene of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since this seems to him "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de May" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times the Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood," Blood of May", "Seven tables of French billiards," and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," says Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the sevillane dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and argued for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the two wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The performance was made thanks to two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with her student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and this honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered to be divas".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially at the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have enormous influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 pm at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trianat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Trianat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This light populist" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling to the different Andalusian provinces, will be in New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
The least American without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Maliciousness", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all over America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been turning since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and now I've lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or to exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the American esteem has fallen down, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains only for humans to admire and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honour of his deceased elder after an overdose and the creation of his own biofood brand.
It was a victory for a country that had a hard time imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put the bar on us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to get through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities did not miss him for not being.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropic", he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a deleterious note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the outset.
The errors start with the removal of the backrests, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they move you it'd be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They would only make you go there to take the back (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long waiting row) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second error, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that small jerseys with less fabric and less cost?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Apart from the fact that you need to go early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your back bag at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions started and we had not yet left our back bag at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, did not mark the start properly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to me primarily with the idea.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
A new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented at MIT Microsoft's conference on Emerging Technologies, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the company campus) in response to what was asked of it during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listening to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also bring them together according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about more than a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found out that if computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly stressed that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed as this is the essential basis for understanding computer equipment and software.
He is in the same position as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
We only light the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than through windows.
Who serves half the applications provided with the system?
Which can be the least.
And Windows 7 must contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, confined months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they can finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, one shows their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But since Android's launch is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Parrain' and is part of the holding of the association of muscle gays.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also quote this mustachus rib that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple men's shirt in cotton, wet and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' distinguishes itself from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the most famous body shirts have in their neck.
But pay attention, because the Belgian brand does not only produce top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of the undergarments.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His huge resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who claim their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s enchants us and we are inspired by it for our collections.
I love to walk around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do so.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that yes, but ultimately everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very small, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my dress.
Dancers like to dress up for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear the clothes, that's when you actually put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, everything's connected.
You didn't have 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, I'm happy for 30 years.
I find that women are more mature, have more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna become a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to go out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman who comes out of the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have it all now but of course it's not possible.
I look forward to the film 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
To see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the mannequin.
Just, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women's support and the clothes we displayed - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things aren't true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to walk for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pier, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol repeaters on the wheel will have to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the vehicle in drinking conditions, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reinsert the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once intoxicated, take the car.
Alcohol will avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the hallein and prevents the start of the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people each year.
This measure concerns only administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out through regular channels, but, however, criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form of trade, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Specifically tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of going to bed, but its rays still forced to put their hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of travel.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very heavily and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going into the room where the official court awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a ridiculous Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no place more suitable in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no designer living more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talent of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank Stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us at a luxurious dinner at opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making against bad good fortune, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a dress of Mango and some of ELAH's hairs, which cut off the breath, and arm on him, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a man gallant, as well as the Baron of Rothil finished the evening without a dress because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pants and a shirt - of her own collection - and who for dinner metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and recalling the old time, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked for, there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh here, it's life.
1001, the number antistress
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakening almost saddens us when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think of the harrowing rhythm that imposes our present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat day-to-day fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But either 1001, or one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu of methods adapted to each's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manuel' denies such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from his mind and focus on reading.
Speak in Sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not report to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called sleepwalking.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Sure there's more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (once in life for example associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other sleeping disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night sickness (drinking in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very severe fevers, stress situations or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepwalking becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation to this problem.
We said it's a benign alteration, which is why there's no treatment, unless it's related to another sleep disorder that can be cured (for example, if it's related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore find quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he won't remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and so rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, he is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question it for information.
You won't get anything, because he's sleeping, he's not aware to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to find out his secrets.
Not even kidding.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of drought.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks have created the greatest number of opportunities and have managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter where attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who frowned on a distant shot, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn around Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of his foot or Diebold came to rock the defense of Dannemaria.
In front of that, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the Riahi swirling at the end of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53th').
But the Illousian chef will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will have to return the dressing room a dozen minutes later and leave his team in digital inferiority.
But Dannemaria won't be able to take advantage of it and won't put great problems to an eleven illolusian who just retreated a bit to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big lock, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of angry fishermen
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a diversion by Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of force of fishermen who had severely disrupted the access of several ports of Breton and Norman, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the flow of diesel prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesperson of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out escargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in closures of close to 10 km.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle Island did not stop.
A filter dam was launched on the nearby island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Manche, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at dock, or the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of the ships of commerce.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
The members of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting in the Department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday about the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview provided for by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will leave nothing" and "do not want to move to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on the diesel fuel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but feel that the profitability threshold of a vessel is only reached with a diesel less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes praised the film legend and the actor Paul Newman died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian airliner sets out 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the global economy's recession threats.
The fourth world aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintained his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer looks forward to the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft from the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider assigning more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have been inflated, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activities in the United States, according to the newspaper that cites sources close to the file.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evenings to discuss possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets whose IGA plans to separate include its international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings resurator and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision was taken on these assignments, the FT continued.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk that the US authorities will take 80% of its capital, diluting to a double proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall Monday following the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the highest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% index (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan which was to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected their plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market was in this respect," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not be "too late".
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, economist leader at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution to the United States," said Mrs. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the repurchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benin, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The return of the 10-year Treasury bond declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% Friday evening, and 30-year-old to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the 1st.
Obama, winner at the points of the first TV show
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another one happened to know who took John McCain or Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the GQs of Republican and Democratic Campaign proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to slow down in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday, gives Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44%) to McCain, considers that it was the Democrat who drew his pin out of the game.
In the indecisive voters, who are those who count, Obama went out winning for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them win McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his collister, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," however Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
McCain's Seventeenth-year-old continued to highlight his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naivety" on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he has repeatedly accused.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama stressed that he was representing the future.
Without dismounting, he proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama, yes," retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot accusing the Republican of not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American Street".
"During the eighty minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a beating rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "medium class" or "workers." The financial downturn clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most able to save the economy on the brink of precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that 95 per cent of Americans would still be able to reduce their taxes despite Wall Street's overwhelms, the Illinois Senator also noted that the achievement of potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Considerably, the two candidates avoided issues relating to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday evenings in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evenings after the closing of the polling stations on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What a good thing, because they will do what they want to do from my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good figure for foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers to be specific.
They were not opposed to it.
"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping," Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, deplored a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that it counts the voices, and in our homes, it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter the parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noted that there was an election, you? question Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of Parliament's opposition, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Blood returned safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outcry, in February 1994, the Government of Canada instituted a public investigation, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then established a committee with the aim of planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said proudly, saying that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94 per cent of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, were seen in Europe, reports the one that has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, that when it is not known and that a serious disease can result from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by brain degeneration leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
Thus, in April 1999, the blood of those who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that enable direct detection in donor blood of the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs allowed to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any person who is 18 years of age and over who meets the eligibility criteria may, however, give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow old and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life being so scary, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cordon blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cordon blood and are expected to be taken more than a thousand a year.
We should begin to propose these for grafts early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cordon blood collection as very popular.
"More mothers are disappointed not to have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Semi-Final Impact
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the fourth round of the final at the total goals, at Stade Saputo.
The middle of the ground Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half with no purpose on either side, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field center marked the other nets of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first round-trip game, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a deficit of 3-1 in the game back to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps also accessed the 5-4 half-final round to the total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victorious Butt of Kovalev
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn stimulated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win on dam shots in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec raised two aids, and Kovalev picked a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest put on the North
The Prime Minister shall not hold elections until the end of the year.
Soon the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), was trying to be elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Reducing the limits of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of Moulin with images.
They turned into loops, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as well as in the election period.
In the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
However, the Prime Minister just explained why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give due time, investment amounts, or a specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as large as France", "it's home to us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show well that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the road to gold in Abitibibi, Quebec's engineering, James Bay.
"It's us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, explained the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity comes, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, talking about the northwest passage, which will open all year round because of the ice cast.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Hungarian Pequist MP), have already started consultations with about 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded him.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have considered otherwise to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Centrale Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Borassa who made James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Charest stressed that its implementation was planned for 2012.
"That remains between us, but I plan to be there," he entrusted his militants to them, sparking warm applause in their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not neglect the opportunity to conduct an election this fall, which is what the law allows him to do.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, including by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the main lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
Pequist leader Pauline Marois pointed out the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The AQA said it supported the government's adoption of a North Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who comes back on vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored Country
This was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (i.e. irony) in Harper's office, who last summer allowed herself to say of Louise Arbour that she was an "honour" for Canada.
This is how to reproach this woman who has waged an unceasing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration to say as long about the Prime Minister's environment as Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take any account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a quite young teenager at the time of the facts brought against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to collapse under inhuman conditions.
The only one who resorts to a parody of justice to assess the accused's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that shuts its eyes to torture: it doesn't matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably never after so many years of exaggeration.
We do not yet realize this, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", that word that Harper keeps branding and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a head of government until now minority (so it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party advocating the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17, issue, Le Duvoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Canadian Mining Vice-President Barrick Gold.
Continuing an Orwellian logic, the author claims that the largest gold company in the world has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the sound in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to hiss?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defence and to fight, to very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will undermine the opposition in addition to defrauding anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas rather than with a matraque.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, records and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of that same audience?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to paid fat lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather close view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is prepared to hear and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a prosecution-baillon (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also just filed a stand-up for Black Canada's authors urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It also denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss matters that disturb wealthy businesses in this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada's authors.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms limiting this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still has to be endorsed by both Congress Chambers.
It includes: improved monitoring by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to the managers of the relief companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been on the sprint in the last few hours, fearing the effect of a new failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline for opening the markets this morning was agreed.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that we were obliged to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed himself to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that aimed at allowing owners to keep their home and that on the salary of the leaders of the companies that were rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the U.S. television waves.
Asked on another chain to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The main lines I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsaleable debts of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble which has first led to the collapse of mortgage-at-risk (subprimary) credits before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CPAA) and leading to a freeze on liquidity and the disruption of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who had the first draft of the deal capped last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been lifted since Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round out the angles for everyone at Congress, a provision was also added that if the government was to take five years' losses with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its delivery.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
Another 350 billion should be paid by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will be able to obtain participations in the relief companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torment is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans involved in this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plans will have the green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the republican and democratic camp.
"Of course, Washington is not listening to you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to take advantage of taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of the sceptics", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to tell us: Congress is asked not to hurry and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas reported that it had refused to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it had lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the risk real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
It is precisely something that savings and households now appreciate the uncertain announcement of time."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account all ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41.5 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one who would buy the British bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in the eyes of the day was a long time his hard card, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissical mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His pudding, sensitivity and talent that flowed from source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, following lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons of American cinema in the years ahead.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was long a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostolate of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and of a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last brand of quality.
Because in him a whole country was conceived with self-made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who went second to the Mans 24 hours in 1979, with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic star are also disappearing with him at the cracks of the show-business, of which the enigma will not have been completely lost.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought the vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, as his great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parade through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a well-suited burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958, is again in memory.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hatred), by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, taken after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malphrase in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will resume his character on his return to Martin Scorsese's Color of Money, which he valued in 1987 his only Oscar on nine appointments.
This face through the ages, it was him.
He's still him.
The times rush through his course.
Young people know him primarily through George Roy Hill's cultious Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a low-orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Losing in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends that left the trade quite early, Newman will have stayed in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its exploits and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his services too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all cooked up in the beak.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals poorly known facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (from the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated to him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of powder and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that had been heaped on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood's derivatives.
We will have seen his well-grunt thundering on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, has committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizens model, in sum and above.
What could have made Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearings related to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has caused particularly significant damage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, about 65 million HUF, was going on the one hand in the cassettes of the Fair Baloldal movement and on the other hand in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to pay the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they made invoice books in the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies to be included in the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tour in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the basis of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, inter alia, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the City of Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András ★ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
One of Lados' choices was a bistro during a search circuit.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will subsequently bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, grew up with defects of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night. However, the bill mentioned a hundred and thirty customers.
In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told the hvg.hu website that when the prosecutors summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the seal."
He added: "Beyond the shape, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, did not collide either, since this facility only has eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zero invoices have also not been informed about Budapest's travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad. So, naively, they have indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
They also added VAT to these documents, as the survey revealed, while travel activities benefits, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Revfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits did not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The prosecution's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made errors by mentioning as a provision the transport of goods by road, that the invoice company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezrédért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó's sports internship, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Neither did the falsaries pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company refused to issue this invoice.
Deliberate invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictional invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established an invoice at the order of the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of HUF four million.
According to the indictment, the company manager Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices at the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefit has actually been provided.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention it in their accounts.
The next category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the CEO of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and automobiles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices in the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he damaged their countervalue.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian Masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He also used these companies, since, at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-author and editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices to their names, in order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 total invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
Man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség Association in Modern Magyarországert filed a grant application with the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Tánciscos Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for a two-fold amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
Furthermore, these invoices were found during the search conducted in the office of Árpad Kemecsei, Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had already done before the prosecution.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the reimbursement of much of the 50 million HUF, Zusi alone would bear the hat.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since applications for his supervised residence, based on a reduction in his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home at the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate the goods.
New York University researchers in neurology and economics have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as sales on eBay auctions, and that is why they prefer to even pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to develop a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using sales at experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the loto, while the other group took part in a sale for playful auctions, while using a functional magnetic resonance (RMF) process, researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could earn money, but during the sale to auctions whose essential element is the oversale of a third party, the whole under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of the stratum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were over-employed against one partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and did so.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would get out of the party, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received $15 before the auctions, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed at home on victory, while at home on failure.
In this way, demonstrating the assumption of neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were willing to be placed higher than those performed by the control group and the "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena found in auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, resulting in a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York, found.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death in Hungary.
One hundred miles are estimated to be the patients with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment, which is because the patients often do not know they are the carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver-affected infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is in any case recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogen destroys liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult with its physician treating symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients in all four corners of the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who grows up in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford realized an interesting experience by analyzing how much belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, where academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different areas of the university.
Specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and spreading the electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to keep a close look at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not much different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, they received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while looking either at the painting on a religious theme or the one on a more general theme.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe," as someone we "take care of" and they "calmed, and peace invaded them."
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% pain less than when looking at the work of Leonard.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image in which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same size were shown to believers?
Would the view of a virgin Mary of better quality lead to better results?
You're what you're spreading about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their holidays, what specialists they are consulting and what their interests are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, that is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to sceptics that are paralleling Orwell's sight of horror, they do not see exactly the essential of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their initial goal that sounds like: "Gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's leader interviewed, after ten years of global camouflage work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What's the job that would be best for me?". However, software will be able to answer this kind of question, simply at first sight, only on the day when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Custom Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for, what they have clicked on. Through this, in the long term, Recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, when he looks at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but, in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Internet users who are concerned about human rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, whose arms are below with the EFF legal protection agency, has proven its right to court in front of the FBI. According to the judgement made, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points in the constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to strengthening the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. But ultimately, it is not able to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Therefore, Google's judgment is quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their privacy and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion against multinational societies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of large companies, the "coporation connected", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as invasion of the world because of Windows, and that, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continuously cooled, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 concerns nothing other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A youth, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a system of prosecution, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, where they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While we can learn about many examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands in the morning pictures, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is completely to reconsider today.
One who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how we can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (e.g. with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time leaving no trace intentionally).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not less. Google's online services, through the processing of text to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not resemble our best profile, which have existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft but to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all of this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of society has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's motherhood and after the society has considered the daily multiple restoration too costly, taken at any time. All this seems to be derisive in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, society detects all the results that harm the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that the Google Book Scan and Archiving Project takes such important dimensions that society will soon find itself in the face of the United States Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical benefit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an exhilarating way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to remove traces of Ozd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. Based on suspicions, they helped eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesperson of the department of Borsod.
Young people have recognized the facts they are being accused of, and for now they are being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a young man from the 23-year-old corner, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as that nine-year-old girl.
According to MTI's information, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange stock package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to separate itself from more than 60% of its shares in a few months' activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at between 5 billion and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank, with approximately 25 per cent participations, followed by the 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, the leading European press newspapers already mention a "second September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American President" - accuses the daily life of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a proposal of law, improvised to the va-vita, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the issuing goat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that led the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress vote, a real threat, the one Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - highlights the Tages-Anzeiger de Genève.
Some states can still hold a lifeboat to their securities financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse such dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to take little account of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Nothing but Monday, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands to the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, partly crosses the old continent.
The "saviours" must not immediately sell a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noticed in which case it would be rational to pay the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing more damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the boulder
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, which took place in Japan, bourbon bees gave the strategic idea of departure to Nissan's engineers, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotized control system, type BR23C, which he has equipped with bee qualities, the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee is its own space, of oval shape, which actually resembles a lot of our safe protection shell - Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and the technological public relations of the brand, explained.
The bee's face-eye plays a key role, as it is capable of seeing in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the facet-eye functions, engineers addressed the idea of laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If it wasn't so, the mini auto robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bee.
The process must take place at a glance.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotating movement, acceleration as well as slowing down as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is greater, which makes their life longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only treat a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of a giga-byte capacity, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards designing an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its way into the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying out doubted bank credits, and using them several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this is going to be spent.
Reuters announces that during further discussions that continue until midnight, Saturday, the local time of the east coast, Congress leaders agreed on the controversy that had existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have made a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which there is no more than to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said that he commented on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a matter of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday to 2:00 a.m., depending on the local time in Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that responds to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the programme differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent on a single-time basis on the purchase of debt on doubtful credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress's adoption on Monday. This first sum will serve as the Treasury Secretary to purchase doubtful bank claims, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious debts, mortgages and doubtful mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that purchases can take place as part of an auction sale, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the root of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast repurchase of doubtful claims, insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system causing the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the enforcement of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called a gold parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
The ceiling on wages is only mentioned in specific cases. Moreover, limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat proposes its assistance to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys in connection with a auction sale, they will collect an extra tax on the golden parachute unless the retired bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of doubtable claims, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
For the image to be complete, however, it must be added that existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling is only for new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the appointments of the directors-general - commented the chairman of the committee responsible for the financial benefits of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State provides a right to acquire shares in banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have given us a mandate, which does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican deputy of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
A deflation resulted in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry have increased from 0.2% to 0.9%.
In the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water sectors, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, prices in the oil processing sector have been the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the manufacturing of metal products, prices were increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases have occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).

Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "currently, everything depends only on the moment that electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into service."
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from now on in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will restore the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the 700 billion-dollar government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress and Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded principle agreements on bank rescue plans.
This funding plan, aimed at the desiccation of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as fit as the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the introduction of economic questions, Obama has again managed to make some progress. McCain's advance, achieved with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colister just after the Republican convention, has sunk.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote the 700 billion rescue law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages he also supports.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to qualify McCain's economic ideas for surpluses.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time swallowing it (...) but nothing to do is a way".
The Republican Senator stated that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Board and the capping of senior management's departure allowances are mentioned, and that he was personally attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote for the bill on Monday.
The press review of German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this recognized polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took up its duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these same modern citizens turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to have been completed just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU rose by 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so much mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be called upon to modernize "devoting her parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they have been strongly wrong about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east of the Bavarian region, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more educated.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of classic citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the independents, the artisans, the holders of the scholarship and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU decreased by less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? Who ? With whom ? Party presidents stand on the reservation to the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of confusing domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
ÖVP forbids SPÖ to interfere with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in public television debates, party leaders hardly let their cards be interviewed.
Werner Faymann, the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was rejected in any case.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to engage in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is at present a very open question, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris, whose host is France, as the representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, Euro MP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during the hiring, Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic right of human beings plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of EU member countries.
According to the Euro MP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roms.
Indeed, early on, a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation by the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of de-gregation of schools. For this, compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; it is necessary to give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens in full right to the future of Europe," Járóka said.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe organised annually since the Berlin Summit last year is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equality of opportunity and to combat discrimination, targeted at European and Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
It is October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite this pathetic election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly critical peer have, in any case, felt that they were not particularly at their seats.
As a result, they worked to soothe the angry members of the fraction and the base, which one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian-socio-union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the only "sovereign sovereign" in Bavaria, giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives still have a strong role in this region of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates dialogues with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose foot of fate was that using the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber was used as the possibility of putsch perpetuated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman with care.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the ficelles into the backstages, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be a chancellor again only if they are set up in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured USC, and the socio-democrat crisis always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the removal of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-million-in-the-counter legislation in this country has been very much opposed for decades, prior to yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (OSSZ) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in doubtful elections, on the traces of the change of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of some Members of the opposition to the parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the anti-democratic Belarusian political order, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry visa, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit due to the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which was increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, owner of gas pipelines across the country, was passed to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on failures, such as the prohibition of presenting itself for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior calming.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when voting was taken.
Despite all this, the opposition still has a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and Abazia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories already a month ago.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important is that dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, even though "the power was afraid in this Parliament which has no weight, to bring even one opponent in".
The opposition does not envisage protest actions in the light of results, rather it tries to deliver its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we need to have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put us on wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting elections, even in the circle of older people," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially-supported retirees does not consider it more to be appropriate.
"Because of the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'representing the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have qualified the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." Thus, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against the little noodles, against which it points and then drinks coffee at the bar during the hours of work.
The anti-faking novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors- relates Brunetta- are a tool for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services," the Minister said.
Now a new season of accountability and transparency begins.
"It's reformism," adds Brunetta.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary General says: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissants.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Superior School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months, the absences of public employees' illness have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand workers over a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "including wage dynamics," explains the Minister- over the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the standards of decree Brunetta using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today is making data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness-writing the consumer association - the people of "active exploiters" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare the war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in cases of disability for reasons of service is challenged; the extension of the hours of home stay of the sick worker, during which inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crime Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who are permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the gravity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil today celebrates, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents on Labour, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at the workplace," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, Association nationale des mutilés et invalides du travail, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort to prevent accidents at work, to protect injured workers, to assist victims' families and to raise awareness of public opinion."
"naturally unworthy, everyone has struck with fists to put an end to such tragedies which, by their dimension, provoke the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repeatable cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, our attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the warning on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has emphasized how much" this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data of accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "tendence to the discount" to be translated, in fact, into minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy comes.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We felt that Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this is from school."
- He added - "There is still a need to make an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of employers' responsibilities in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Merandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "derived from assistance to which the system has been operating in recent years."
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the assurance of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the accidentr should not depend on the spontaneism or enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - let us read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at full volume can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data - the responsible EU continues - this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in view of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels called on the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-conclude the EU-executive confirm that there is good reason to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is a growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to well limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum level of noise agreed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during prolonged periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we will end, in June we will draw the we are.
This is the timetable set by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Caracalla Thermes.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop the Directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it, and it would like to point out that Germano must propose ideas for the development of Rome, which can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time period.
In June-announcing the mayor will present the strategic plan resulting from the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its views will not be binding, Germano replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper prospective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic assembly: it is absolutely free, and it will not cost Roman citizens a euro, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "it takes a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit,".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to go independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the other hand, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really cocky: he thinks he will gain the highest function of a nation that counts at all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; they are of course racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the depths of the South of the United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality that has been kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent back to her ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, most of Iraq was Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge spot to do.
Usa, the economic debauchery makes itself felt even among journalists: in the press, it's time for deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the Pew Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly express their concern about credibility to information officers.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where editors work in assembling newspapers, are a major problem.
This is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is to be understood by the general public, it should not be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is taking a wrong turn.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Published against broadcast.
Journalists don't have any trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses were moving to the Internet, often perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest catch in American journalism lies between those who run newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to the "health of work".
Directors who are thinking of losing their jobs in the 3-year period are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question to take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, spent a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STANDS THE GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bank route as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
During his trial last week, he had obtained the release of his home in Grottaferrata as a compulsory residence.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked for the real estate agent to travel from the city of province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and it is, even more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is yesterday's New York Times that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate East Coast vigour, favourable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, precisely, which has been made to feel despotically with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or already leaving it running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it may be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomenon that has been covered for some time, so that in the new climate they are solidifying and revealing.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the double sovereign state category, of a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for which it governs it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or not, has little to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political lines.
And so, it is from the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there are only those States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar manner.
This new emphasis of the state-of-the-art crisis is still in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor that is quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, when we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-materials, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized once again that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with things that are not material enough like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are bound absolutely to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I am now coming to the second novelty, which nevertheless provides for a fracture.
Says Territoire, State, Government, inevitably says Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of alienation that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
This increases even further the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites to date at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the views of the majority.
in short, The demand for leadership, undergroundly feeds, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or rather, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the last time, from the conservative ascent in Bavaria Austria, to the fall of workers in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressists against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their format, they would say, have more and more difficulties, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and potentially agitating in a measured manner.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda, it seems quite frankly exaggerated.
But we say, keep your eyes wide open, that's not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Conquer the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With a adhesive measuring only 2.5 square centimeters, researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms attached to a vertical wall.
The U.S. Science magazine published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a specific carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Téflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "is easily detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Can it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also seeking new membership.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made up of microfibres such as hair, which self-cleans dust during the movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because desalterant and vitamin-rich, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter the amplifying or decreasing absorption depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juice, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: it is sufficient to have a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized as it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arithmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological medicinal products up to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to assess the danger from this mix and to make sure that you drink medicines, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan, called: "These findings are in general immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the explanatory papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist," said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Kenesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered many controversy, and was blamed on the economist for years, but now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive, highly critical divulger of the excess liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, professionals to the public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year's work, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to more important ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format chart with elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration between several people has been an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a colour of comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to carry out some of OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation code may be shipped at home or at work.
And if the theme of freeness can be a means to spread it in the houses, it is precisely in business, that Open Office then tries the big challenge, already able to rely on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Target 2008 to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that, with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber jersey.
It is the site of the daily The Team that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl tests are part of those performed in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity in the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus raising the pea jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES IS REQUESTED IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as an immigrant country has recently become a special destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would this turn the Beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is about, which devoted a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where we register "more integration and more work", but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the most important support to the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendance emphasized by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market was not aware of a crisis
According to Sunia's last survey, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples, 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects at the point of exclusion of the whole categories of young people, of the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand by students has distorted the market so that a process of generalized increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, rent-free, sub-allocations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes approximately 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are required for a simple one, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values slightly lower (550 euros for a simple one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocella or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, the cities eliminate historical halls.
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the stagemaker Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the great Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the great multisalles, and the death of consumption of mono rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appears to us ineligible and indisputable; in addition it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and charged with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of track and so much emotion," observes the director of the New Cinema Paradise, which offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and who reported the poetry of a province hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trader association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the costs mostly: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is leading 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirming that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-threaded cinemas: 195 screens plus in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilie-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has grown irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is also necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm room in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of the credit for traders: the previous debt of the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million a year.
We note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, concerned by these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mayory and Anec, the first such in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of historic and periphery centers.
Among the proposed regulations, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special parking rates and certain parking lots.
"It's an initiative that pleases" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
However, it is clear that, in contrast to the super power of multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that, for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise" to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have had so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the black panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardize the mayor's choices with the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia association.
The manoeuvres also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his youngest lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for the association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a deal with legal and moral norms, and especially common sense," wrote the prosecutors, both local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations in Maître Piromalli.
"So we would have been given to the clan - writing the judges - to officially enter within the mayors facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loirero, does not hide that "colossus between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the drangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests followed last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's communal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, was appointed head of a right center coalition after the May 2006 ballotage.
He called the scandal when the prefectures ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, who accused him of handling everything for a political issue, but in view of the request for imprisonment signed this morning, judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the A3 project.
From interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a better known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy comes from waves, the big ones are now launching.
This is an over-measured deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have set their eyes, and now try to put their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 estimated that 15% of the global electricity need could be covered by offshore operating systems.
That would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosses to the attack.
The first company to put on marine energy was the Energy, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a real revolutionary step.
Two years from this, more and more candidates among these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy focus on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, and it assesses opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the path of energy coming from the sea, and the funds invested to this day, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at the outset, on the other hand, the fact that marine energy does not dispel concerns about environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem with the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technology must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the sludges upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under sailors.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and a part of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping centre and a parking space using six submarine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from the wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the shores, invested $7 million and half dollars in 2008 and plan investments up to 35 million in 2009.
