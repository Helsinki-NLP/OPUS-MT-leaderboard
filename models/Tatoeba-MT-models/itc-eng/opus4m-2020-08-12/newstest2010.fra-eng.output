Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, inter alia, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third will be awarded the prize in the Committee's own chamber.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is leading a war in two countries at present.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to mention.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish kroner (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but he has not yet decided on which.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
For example, he mentioned feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the Association Société des protectors de la nature de Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for his withdrawal from his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Société des protectors de la nature de Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and at risk of up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting buckets are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packaging, while in the villages of South Moravie you fall on sort stalls at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right buckets.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that our city's second largest city councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone in the sorting of waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which mainly requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the time being is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't mind, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So to end, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
By parness.
It makes them a trout to get to the stalls.
I'm not surprised by them.
After a party myself, I offered to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colour buckets of Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is likely that ecology and so-called aestheticism do not interest Brno's socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first league of hockey that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my printing with official statistics after dragging a moment on the Internet.
According to the company data EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole region of South Moravia.
Parubek's budget has dropped from retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or public servants may be lacking money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make borrowings for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "That's only putting problems back later, mine the land," said Janota.
It is important to know that on borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will need to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not lower social aid or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those currently growing on the left: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the cash registers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repair it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be missing five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already determined and started sections that cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the caution of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very properly - it will draw in the dividends of ČEZ (the supplier and distributor of electricity), which the state has most and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, it was 18 billion that were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the reform of pensions that is being prepared.
Moreover, this tip increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money from the department or, at the worst, from the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which has to track on-line the expenditure of each government.
The first step will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota said.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
Projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which deals primarily with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is no part of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the rise.
VMware now works with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Desert tracks pose no problem only to climb-up operators.
The lack of snow dissuades people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits to our site.
Netizens travel through offers, ask for prices but do not want to commit to booking for the time being.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl information portal.Info.
If we want to spend the New Year of his dreams at Špindler in Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate too much.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes next, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hoteliers offer for now only one week's stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try to place them again, but they're going to give up, too, and they're going to accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours Tourist Agency of Vrchlabi also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting thing for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as well as Christmas.
There is great interest during the holiday of January of the Polish and February also sells well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the latest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have 60 percent of the current occupation.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will still certainly have indicated the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hoteliers, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But then time should get warmed up, reports Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the sage reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be very simple.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so strongly awaited, it turned out that he had collected it on carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text itself several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, moreover, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months showed, however, that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful so that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, so objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
It was once again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite its subordination habits.
He called for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President hesitated for three months but without a better option, he cheated on the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in removing the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had 10,000 originally.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this whole process in three years. All Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides for answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same results as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no one can be counted and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership day by day according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only dust in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity regarding reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "ready-to-act state", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes her volunteering amaze.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war in view of their "soon return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect confession of the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is geared towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond to this when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only Russian for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it to plan on a new strategy, if this would prove to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
High-placed employees of the American Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism about its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from management if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link salaries with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
Concern is found in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of critics after putting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong bank sector premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to allocate a single tax of 50 per cent of bankers' bonuses above 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
There are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI of Sweden the Nobel Prizes in Technical and Literary Disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euro)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The very anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was already given this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward because it is only at the beginning of his course and he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is planning to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who will put his stay on the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which further deepens the public finances crisis.
President Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies has validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers on Wednesday and has increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of the democratic social groups for their indirect increase in the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreeing that questions the future of Fischer's office which had been formed by agreement between the SOD, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and which he believes must be charged with the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not force it, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irrefrable deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could rely on a consensus of wider political parties, according to the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is disturbing and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the SDG and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is overwhelming and will exceed 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the coming year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticisms of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus' new film - Invaincu will expose to the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded at the Oscars, incarnates Nelson Mandela's life film, untiringly fighting against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a eighty-first-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to embody you, I should be able to see you personally..
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the box, for example, embodyed the leader of an anti-slavery movement himself, a fictional U.S. president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone alive and as important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African State man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invaincu and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is persuaded to be able to unite his people by sport and decides to join rugby players who are among outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually make progress at the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality," said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind bars before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I reached out to you, I recovered your energy, it was transmitted and I felt like knowing how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the direction of the director Eastwood has received positive reviews and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film evaluations on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only recognized yesterday as having tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile which was originally the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the equipment again.
It's obviously the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire from a moving and immersing vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has probably been a defective "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In previous cases, engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test releases have happened without a stopover, the Ministry of Defence's leadership considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This rate of success of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and therefore they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again be in a 51-year-old professional match.
The world's former champion, the Olympic champion and Stanley Cup's holder, will hand in hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his way back in the Friday game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is for now the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he took gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champions, he won Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that trade unions reported an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, management still wants to agree with trade unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz website indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroners to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded after the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way its employees are motivated in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and warmest point in trade union comments and claims as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily for two additional hours in more than eight hours.
Trade unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the automobile plant and the trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the factory ended last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went into strike due to excessive overtime.
They also protested against the poor pay conditions and so-called vices.
Management defended the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
During the Monday strike announcement, trade unions also requested that employees who had ceased production be subject to no sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 kroners (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also deals with viruses that have already developed drug immunity.
This reality, in some cases, is based on the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the lives of patients can be radically prolonged through a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Republic's Academy of Sciences, the Prague VŠCHT and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to coping with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes affect the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on the protein of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the atoms of bore, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explaining researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic's Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV-protease substances has been tested in test specimens as well as its resistant variants obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to address the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ★ezáčová, director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemy and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates of the European Parliament
The president of the SDO (Democrat Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek has described the approved budget as "sufficient" for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge his existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the SDO's statements as a drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
ODS spokesperson Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the SDG and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to speak to the House of Deputies in support of the minority concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDG and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for amendments of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The Chamber has increased money for employees' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance about the proposals of the democratic social groups was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the wish of the government as what a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and unnecessarily
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of proposals for amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to government:
He at the same time indicated that he wondered whether he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to address the budget deficit, Nečas considers that the representatives of ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not at issue.
This is the case of the Chief of the Fischer Government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments are demanding TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the fight against the public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda, then I'll devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew into the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO went backwards at the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, Nečas pointed out that the SDG would probably have voted against the modified budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked democratic Members to allow the budget to be voted.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not little children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the Chamber or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a curfew of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will delete or limit from 13 December certain less-charged express or regional trains and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall on the date of entry into force of the new two-percent hours compared to today.
Most fees will not change, including basic rates and reduced rates.
For example, people in the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Iron Paths will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express will cease serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region of eight percent in total, on the other hand Prague and its surroundings can be welcomed by an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague line - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and a few express trains on the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the esko suburban system, which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines away to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave for two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million extra crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to settle visible losses, i.e. the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have again signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase of the vast majority of transport licences.
Changes will only affect one-day tickets ČD Net and internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while so far it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
Today, the rebels have abducted 75 people south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed them, but spoke at the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels employed hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first continued the raiders following the violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Magundanao in the southern Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23rd November massacre linked to the Governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
These, however, renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the globally known apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rohlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was then awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football world cup, and because the media are driven by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations made to the main roles in which hollywood star "pavant" plays.
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking his own words back.
I dreamed of this long-standing role and prepared myself well.
I have also personally met Nelson Mandela to be able - as it is said - to recover his energy, he indicated during the first film official in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the chance to remember yourself through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term in office to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries therefore during the film to collect two racial groups of a long-divided population and as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he was wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the world's lawn, which South Africa had won at the time.
To show off on the lawn in jersey, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in reuniting people into a single nation again, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
South African whites, however, are sceptical as they have recently been entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of kroner in flames in the Louny region
In the morning a fire Čeps transformer from the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku was caught.
According to Lukáš Marvan, Spokesman of Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally had to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company's spokesperson Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps did not know anything like it and that such incidents are isolated.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, states the spokesperson of ČEZ for the Bohème du Nord Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission sets and electrical lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines paths of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is now going to file a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura told him in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's in exchange for the slanders about the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also pointed out that there was evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are therefore preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is the result of his media show that serves him as a free publicity for his society and his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek said.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he would resume it after New Year.
He stated that the campaign will aim at corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without making tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to Jančura's threats from a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who this is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
Yet parents paid 1600 kroner or more for one dose.
Vaccination of younger children requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 krona in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
To date, the State has spent about 500,000 krona per year on all vaccinations for children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the Janota package.
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 were caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its combination has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference at which our association took part, specialists were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we're glad we could have imposed at least this.
I think this is a direction to follow now said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcals.
We are not really looking at him for the moment, said his spokesperson Vladimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatrics, recognizes that voluntary vaccinations are based on his defects.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said Cabrnochová.
Specialists expect that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococcals also breaks because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance rather than the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This, however, is related to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines through insurance, and doctors receiving vaccines in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that paediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 krona per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be a long way from being easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a museum flight
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal pictures for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been sued while he was loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Press Agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Mr. Frazetta Jr, claimed that his father had been authorized to "enter the museum, by any means, to carry the tables to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Senior refused to give such permission, said the Agency.
Labour defends the increase in budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and reductions in the expenditure announced in the pre-budget report, despite opposition criticisms, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "was missing" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting his decisions until after the elections.
The chancellor also attracted the lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The wrath of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will allow about GBP 3 billion per year - has made the world of businesses angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a boost to the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will fall further than the expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5 per cent
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins GBP 30,000 per year will lose GBP 90 per year and a person who wins GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person who wins GBP 10,000 per year will win GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 resulted in "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the first 5 percent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, denied an increase in tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the previous estimate.
"Half opportunity"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign this Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis", said that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, have they added, "singlely" from difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the decrease in expenditure would be used to support next year's spending rather than to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the announcement schedule - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, money being simply recovered the following year.
However, the Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the Ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that government spending restrictions would only start to feel in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Études Fiscales) said that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only delayed," said his Director Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the US Embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether the same men had been reported missing from their homes in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also seeking information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesperson, said the agency had heard about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether they really are the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
State Secretary Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States had to "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been carried away from their homes by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International Association's report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticisms of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Twelve have been sentenced to prison sentences and the prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leanne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
Since then, however, the authorities have not allowed any criticism, said our correspondent.
"There's a confession."
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit my face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious," Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate losing the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others raped.
While the Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, they admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these organizations were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested, over the past three weeks, in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders in competition for in-kind prices.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view of the top of the track was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining in contrabass.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for some fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim Spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues most relevant to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the mayor (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are practical issues, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the very end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their lawyers of a Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today constitute a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent of secularism) were actually engaged in pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not harmed, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Known for the complicated history and policies of whale fishing, he described the long tradition of the Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspiring, who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent into zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show assembled 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is generally one millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that were growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of the hunt that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a captivating overview of what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's all right to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer trips provided the first information on the ice-casket fountain.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the relief changes under it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the biggest work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson sees the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic Ice Tax system, formed by the saltwater nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class of De'Angelo Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour journey by bus to deposit a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who were one day in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday mornings to deposit crowns on Veterans' tombs, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the Memorial for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has provided more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a dead career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this was a way to thank those who sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Employed in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples stood by their hands, wearing the fresh pine crowns on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Nearly, he was planning the silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others thought to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield in Ohio and had driven eight hours to gather on the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free for... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, and stated the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and discourses are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but the authorizations were always refused.
The detention of an American national may increase the tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their names to the Government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press associate with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be permitted -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often caused a negative reaction to the United States, when the two countries began to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities found an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this would allow an important network of terrorist recruiters who would save the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Upon arrival in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed themselves on condition that they kept the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations for entry into the camps of al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are questioned by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining those in whom they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. secret services have given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets, here on Saturday, calling for more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Convention Convention Palace.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened in the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to his mother's home country, Peru, opened his eyes to the tearing problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already taking place."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the big walk -- to make the word pass and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they had pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they had pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked for anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing masks and black clothing lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel that is surrounded by some ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators failed to raise the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate.
When asked whether he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, this is something I had not been aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind leading institutions, the report shows that Grades 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress are the persisting gap between the results of Afro-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Afro-American Progress in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling from only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of Education Group Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I do not miss the joy of one or two points won, says Kwame R. Brown (Democrat's relative), member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (primary school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that the middle schools (schools) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (schools).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students at elementary class end classes and college starters who have not integrated the bases of reading earlier in their school careers and are quite late in relation to their peers.
Every day, the math program, for the Kindergarten (Maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these lower-level students, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for less successful schools in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, can be sure that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements to reducing the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "start point" to get even more in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, down and blinks for a moment in the eyes of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where school fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed that she would like to study medicine, while the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says she's a dreamer, when she was given the low ratio teacher of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they have fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands of children who benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" of five-year high school students -- a remarkable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, and they open the way for future generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study beatings claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high targets for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gandara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We must consider providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared yourself) , it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that start when low-income family students are middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq, which has been invalidated by dozens of years of war and sanctions.
American companies left with only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies have opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military troops withdrew, have curbed American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which owns the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, the analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided it with their technical advice, left their hands empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more contracts than other companies and has broken down with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected auction companies made bids that were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the leading organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, having hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, reported Friday by the U.S. counter-spinning authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their cars on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani secret civil services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Representatives of the Authority said that local activists suspected of precipitating on-site and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally dechicheted bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the deaths.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers leading terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida's leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known by the American general public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jallov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing suspected informants impotently, says the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdrew
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate with widespread allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide takes place when the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States schedule for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italo-Switzerland citizen who recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of encouraging President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism in relation to the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations employment regulations hampered his ability to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's great powers were soon to impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressing himself in front of an outpost of 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a reversal.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring back its nuclear programme in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has developed such an agreement, a means of building confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has been far away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided on whether or not it is committed to the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's consolidation of some of the proposals made by the international community for which they had actually given their agreement in early October pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in the light of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including the pursuit of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhancing sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations stated what it calls "unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue its talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet with troops leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid all delays in American plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to ease the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up with advertising posters about the sermons, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave".
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left," said 31-year-old Wang, Director of Human Resources, who has an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good play and abuse, known as the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and older will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission said that fertility couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of work in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discriminate at work.
The Chinese authorities attributed the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys - girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples at home, and to slide forwards under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although those in charge in a rural town in the suburb of Shanghai say that they have seen an increase in applications for couples' files wishing a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu, Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly believe that the single child's policy is a problem of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
It's true, we steal the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more acutely.
For couples working in two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, he said, it is necessary to be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child asks for a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the fire of the Friday ramp, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it illuminated the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in time-consuming negotiations, with over 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to cope with climate warming, in the course and in the long run.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative toWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described as the "full image" of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer.
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal changes have taken place, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder on China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without effort and action from the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the US main negotiator, either lacking "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help financially China to combat climate warming.
With future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum of political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, prepared a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unity of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in place before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister have come down from their aircraft and have rushed to the Bella Center building to attend keynote meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Palace every day -- guitar players present night shows taunting countries that they believe betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of greats, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for World Conservation Policy International said.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 p.m., Monday morning, a whistle blow will go through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will fly from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first suburban train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service would allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The lost small holes will become flourishing suburban cities, the length of business travel will be much less long, and the passage of the aircraft and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle, and the fear of environmental hazards are likely to slow British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will make its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a higher-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Penguins to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour journey at present.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be obliged to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel periods between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from planes to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers refund the loan of 75,000 GBP for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the principal member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of books a year to reimburse the cost of an orange shop he built in his home of his constituency.
The party leader who was endorsed by David Cameron to complain that the members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension to his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out an audit of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly one million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "viranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Commons Privileges and Standards concerning his prior borrowing arrangements.
The Committee found him guilty last month of any allegations of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the GBP 271,406 loan of his London property at the house of his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard interest rate variable RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Phantom Chief of Staff in September, after a cover-up journalist allegedly filmed him saying that the members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of the Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after he appeared to have requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of fees that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the form of £ in the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of theft, development or use of rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be more clean or simpler."
Faithful, come all see the calendar of Brighton's Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every December day, using the theme of Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Noel songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant in Hove, is a non-remunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We wish religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avant calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred inquiries.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, walked in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to reach an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making the "political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the courthouse, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully black-dressed, broke windows with paving and hammers, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-smuggling police officers immediately intervened without any housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of "Black Blocs", these ultraviolent clusters that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were called in "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them "were always held on the street on Saturday night "manoeuvred and held in a seated position despite extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the court, rather a good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set to accommodate the intended speakers, before a candle stand with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come in and out of the big cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in sky-blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets asking for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, streams where we can walk as we have never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alter-globalist movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, walked in red, popping up bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected his president, Georgia denounces a "face"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "face".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regreeds that Abkhazia had fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the polling office in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region to sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed a little across this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has given warm welcome to Russian officials who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhaze people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus a vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one who lives, called for nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes the delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the court, generally good child, took the lead at Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set to accommodate the intended speakers, before a candle stand with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the court, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
They were immediately surrounded by riot police officers and intervened without any housekeeping, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these ultraviolent clusters that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We had eyes on extremist clusters, warned the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order turned to the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in and out of the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in sky-blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets asking for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, figure of the alter-globalism, said to the AFP that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The organization Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, have demonstrated, clothed in red and treed bands boasting solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The history-geo comes reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enhanced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminals.
Now, first-time students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, he said, "The S is no longer a scientific course" but "in bulk, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-philes of the S, he goes on, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals get inundated with the absence of the history-geography in terminal in technological high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's project to suppress compulsory education in terminal geography history S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right elected.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion sacrifice the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will undergo an eligibility test at the beginning of the year, which will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will address their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow internships in the year of M2 and will then be a first year before students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Superior Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a 15-minute campaign of experts, each filmed and open to the public, saw a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that would catch people and give them a desire to learn more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who draws his name from that given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 stakeholders are selected from their discipline experts and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," told AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will consider that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays of payments: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison supervisor's unions called on Friday to the "general mobility" to require payment by year-end holidays of overtime and premiums which were rejected in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) asked staff who will not be in service to manifest Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block them" to "denunciate the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "convene in general assemblies in different prisons for strong mobilization", judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of overseers, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to make discontent and anger rekindle".
The Correctional Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the supervisor unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, written by the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation resulted from a poor assessment of the number of hours that would not be repeated in the future, said Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for management staff benefiting from the famous functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good backs".
This is a scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseilles has been outraged, announcing its decision to boycott up to the new order "all meetings and meetings".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our strength, it is more than regrettable to bear the burden of staff money, says Bordeaux's Prisoner CGT.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less crowded than others.
But in any case the account is not there, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "sticks that are hotter" than those that he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family at the White House, entrusted to the "paper" of the little screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate their new and prestigious holidays.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Father Christmas also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "certainly" a gift, according to excerpts from the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama went into the wrong line against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Somehow I didn't offer you nice gifts last year," she tricked the president.
Absolutely, was it obliged to grant before responding with humour by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace from the finger: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a strong support from Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball basketball, the president said.
It was only later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The first lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims it's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "legations" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Thursday after the American doctors found "operative lesions" of the discal hernia in Paris on November 26th, he told Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last singer's tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
When questioned by the PSA, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "depending on certain sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park international clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up response infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to make himself "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because it was 12 hours after such an operation, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "responsibly reacted to antibiotics" and that the infection was "independed".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer", and then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of moving on stage by the singer.
In mid-November, his surroundings had even to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first Bousquet on its fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the Worlds-2009 in large basin, arrived on Thursday with an international title on a distance that he particularly affected, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three records in the battus world while waiting for a transfer.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which stood on the world record of 50 m free, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, was the 28-year-old French who imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet led Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were clothed with polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from 1 January.
Originally 238 records from the world since February 2008, these combinations end their epics in Istanbul, which had hosted the first ones in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time in German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large basin this summer in Rome, records of the world to the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark he owns over 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't fight a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola added USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was charged on Thursday, $1.5 million, well above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysia scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyres and Bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five scenes in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold among about a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have most expensive up to now, told the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of Marshal Pétain.
There was a shadow zone of about 50 years.
In searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had been denied an exception by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not gathered, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrival on Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Migration Branch.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him an exception.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the guest chief of state.
The putschist government "has had a new failure in wanting me to give up my charge (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on the Globo radio, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico submitted to us a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Mr Zelaya's initial rumors had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen President, who had come to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the military had strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day when he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" whose justice charges him, according to the putschist government.
The president putschiste Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with figures from the US trade balance showing the resumption of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was attributed to it 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different corners of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, it has tempered, estimating that the market was focused on "the glass at half full".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures in the U.S. trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit declined by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the reverse to dig up the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth in economies of the US's major trading partners, Christopher Cornell, from the Research firm Economy.com said.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States have increased against all expectations last week to up to 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury bond at 10 years has increased to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the return of the Treasury bond at 30 years to 4.492% against 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of power consist of the "White Ladies"
A few hundred Cuban supporters made up the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were called.
Some forty "White Ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were consisted on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP found.
Below the Yankees!, "mercenaires!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were chanting, the lifting fist, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "ensure their protection".
On the eve, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to show themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day were, they, called by civilian police officers, found an AFP journalist.
Police forcefully mounted dissidents who were made up by government supporters, according to this journalist, in civilian vehicles.
Dissidents' requests in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, "Laura Pollan" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners," 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In short, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against counter-revolutionaries.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of human rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced man kills an octogeneer at the knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife forcen killed an eight-year-old and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne, Upper Seine, at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, would have struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogeneary, in or in front of a pharmacy of 85 boulevard Jean-Jourès, learned from police sources and witnesses.
severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 by a police union officer Alliance, died at the hospital following his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged about 30 years, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeneary fell.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, depending on police sources.
The pregnant woman then had a malaise and would have been hospitalized "in shock condition", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
It would have hurt two passersby, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a quadrant, this last gravely.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore on the cross behind his back, explained on site a union officer Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to testimony from the PSA, tried to control the forcible.
I saw a guy about 30 years old with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, Alberto, a server at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jourès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, their officials, tried to interrogate the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passersby came to tell me there was someone injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a security position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 30 years of age, wounded with knives, arrived.
They are national police personnel who have arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has before it the investigation the Departmental Judicial Police Service of the Upper Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forcible was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source has not excluded him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to master him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forces of this species whose forces decouple under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again calls for the cessation of prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California with serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the trial judge at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural fault.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Assistant Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be here to attend the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee? asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands favor to the court, while scorning her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were other alternatives to escape.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who called for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for, once again, an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, restrained by rising the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday, in a market run between better indicators than expected in the United States and the increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq , with technological dominance , abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market's view of the robustness of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of affiliation and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers was significantly raised in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest of two months in the face of the euro, which "brings down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, from Deutsche Bank.
Technology values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the Treasury Bond at 10 years has increased to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the performance of the Treasury Bond at 30 years to 4.497% on 4.492% on the day before.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month of journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates under Miss Monde are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already got their tickets for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du México, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real turbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences! Miss Sierra Leone is calling out.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, beginning at 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my crown back.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of every woman being crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, throw Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will go out in traditional costumes and of course in bath jerseys.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee officer Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knew how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates had as they did last year a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time cycling, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who held their hand.
Not common to a chief of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their best memories will probably remain the draw for the June 2010 World Cup in Cape Town (southwest) a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been around people I never thought I could get close.
I will certainly come back for World 2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David.
Johnny Hallyday's news was "very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father's hair hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's happening very well, told the press David Hallday on his way out of the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13h00 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the relaxed air, assured that he was going to "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a disc hernia on November 26, Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed as an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for a subsequent infection to the operation of a discusal hernia on November 26, Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning to attend a school show by their daughter Jade, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpétriere hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were out there, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thought Johnny Hallyday was "going too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and that was amazing to me, since I had two disc hernies myself, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsburg to re-absorb a hematoma as a result of brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphide reputation, often condemned by justice, in medical records, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Doctors' Order, accused him of being "a man without scrupulously" who continued "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "beyond being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the intervention had been "perfectly well done" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, appears to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a return to the tour on January 8 (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum up the New Centre to no longer use its logo
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the embodiment of the former Giscardian party, emphasizing that he no longer uses it on any basis, subject to judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF logo, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after he stretched out his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his approach, he was supported by Mr. Hervé de Charette (formerly NC UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be deposed, came out of his silence to launch a remand to the Minister and to the MP, adding that they no longer use the logo and transmit the ownership of the mark to them, subject to prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to take over the UDF logo, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also thought it would be good to track on your militant material and on your site's custody page, the name of this movement, the +New center+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also found the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this symbol, explains the UDF office that emphasizes the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as of (his) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) mark to his legitimate rights".
If you did not, the courts would have jurisdiction to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a whole political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted its membership in MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he deposited the mark, he was not "more followers of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It makes scandalous and fraudulent use of the absence of deposit of the UDF acronym to do so on its own.
This indelicacy is transforming into a crime, they denounce, before it is ironic about the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses her, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogeneary for the spoil of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the reigns of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The principal heir and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any event not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will have to report by 10 March 2010 in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt has been in a weak state and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to tell him about it, and he told Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, at the time of the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new (...) Expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady to be protected, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting the penalty against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-inclusive artist, who accuses her of having spent years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masterboards.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' arguments sometimes turned to the big family riot Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was against the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "can you explain to my daughter that I wrote in Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I haven't been able to talk to him since his wedding."
For its part, Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office has again held that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in the last few days to allow her application to initiate a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act on his behalf," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies aimed at its employees has reminded consumers of the position of companies vis-à-vis the marketing revolution: it is a matter of joining employees to "values" determined from above as they once were, of imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies to conquer markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can result in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires employees to make a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would be to place employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the client.
The full usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally comes, after much diversion, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory of behaviorist, recently reactivated by the "neurosciences" of the United States and widely disseminated, in their own, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the managers, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr does it comfort the leaders in a mechanical governance position, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a pre-determined doxa that enables them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and deliver their management of human resources "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo's Speech: The "Just War" is worth the praise to Obama on the right.
The U.S. right-wing welcomed Friday's speech last night in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who had framed the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice-president at the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, did she think?
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, thought that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was very good, and the former President of the House of Representatives congratulated, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On the other hand, I found this speech completely historical, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen "a President of the Left" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen converted chronicler to Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Mr. Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to not be convinced, a faucon of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "terne, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the President, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is involved in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocents can easily be justified, he warned.
However, the left-hand press remained laudable in the place of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, has qualified his address as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" has set on fire the daily Californian.
Obama "spoke the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and uplifting."
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three Marathon negotiating sessions, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employer organization to be left to finish, reached an agreement on Friday night ending the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the holidays for years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and by 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not a big deal, but we're leaving very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We're going to order our militants that there are no blockades, no blockages from the power stations.
But we can always have some recalcitrants that aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will amount to EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaloration of the travel costs of 3%, and the keeping of general road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the question of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the Draft Amending Finance Act for 2009, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first place to undertakings that are members of the organization, and in the second time, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dual market", as the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey eaters of the next awakening, regretted Unostra.
For the other, the agreement is likely to "develop the grave of a large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, trade unions unhappy with RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban transit line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10H00 and 20H00, due to a train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which wait 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores."
The RER Through the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP short section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two circulated at peak hours, and almost no row in hollow hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Franciscans were organized.
Thus, in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The station Saint-Lazare did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided for a management of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut were arriving or leaving the station Saint-Lazare to join the metro.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, considered "weak" by the trade unions, of a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its parentheses premium proposals, the CGT pointed out, stressing that management "was not careful to solve a problem while in roads and SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a wider review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," stated RATP.
Which also made the trade unions say that the company "was making fun of weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interests of calm" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand at RRSP B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions claim a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros of which 30 euros vary (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, are in the range of 2,200 to 2,700 gross euros and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for overtime, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court issued on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurd Party of the country, a decision which was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which had just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a " foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Hasim Kiliz Court told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr Kilicç, adding that 37 of the party's officers, including its President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party ensures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict then intervened when the government had just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to put the Kurds' support to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Upon the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the south-east mostly populated by Kurds.
Order forces fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with leaves.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of the Justice was "to deepen hopelessness".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by an Islamist movement party, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This resolves nothing, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most murderous in recent months.
First snows can fall
What Wolfgang Braenburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sanding service (ESF) makes it clear that it is not to harass citizens.
It's just so agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them.
And according to meteorologists, it could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Braenburger explained that as soon as he began to snow on the city of Frankfurt and that temperatures dropped below zero, large sanding vehicles traveled 20 main routes (called itineraries A) .
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fireworks, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and steep streets such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
EDF staff begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-adhered road founder in up to 3 hours.
That's why the EDF service starts at 3:00 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic starts."
There or that gets harder, it's when the snow goes down at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearance and sanding service tells us "because no motorists are willing to let the salage vehicles pass."
Then, if it doesn't snow again, we take care of access roads and service routes - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and lateral streets come last.
Mr Braenburger well knows that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF pedestrian team set off to prioritize areas deemed dangerous and crossings.
As for bicycle tracks, FES services cannot generally deal with this.
Mr. Braenburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of bridges between 22 and 430 hours.
As the verglas form very quickly on these surfaces, the salage vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in cases of need.
Dinosaurs were cribing them.
The Tawa foundae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipedus was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its skull stretched out was filled with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with scruffed claws and had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from Texas University in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday, the Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangee and was on the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs on a new day.
In fact, he is teaching us about the bonds of kinship, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searches with other paleontologists, on the site of Gohst Ranch north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and member of the search team tells that they sometimes found a dozen bears in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers baptized him on the name of Tawa according to the word of Indian Hopi for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some fragments of incomplete bone.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he says that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts ask, among other things, when the saurians were divided into three major evolution groups: the theropods (carnivores) which included the tyrannosaure and the velociraptor appeared later and which descended the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds along the neck, and those who were related to them and the ornithischial herbivores of which the species such as triceratops and the stegosaure are part.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found clues that the Tawa found small air bags in its bones at the skull level, as well as birds that are the descendants of the therapists.
These small airbags facilitate bird breathing compared to mammals.
It appears that at the Tawa Hallae, vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest therapists with small airbags in its bones.
As the related line of the immense sauropods also had airbags and a light bone, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other therapists who are not particularly related to them.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There were, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn said that there is an even older species, the silhouette, who lived in current Poland and belong to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptiles branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs were distributed throughout the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassics.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have been a massive extinction at which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or at that time, dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favoring the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then had been in the shadows: these were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from around the world.
There are professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those responsible for courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
Evacuation by the J.W. Goethe University casino police makes waves across the globe.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protest students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, the police requested by the university's Steering Committee are not allowed to intervene.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had the buildings occupied by students and teachers evacuated after walls and works of art had been scratched with graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
The signatories felt that the degradations did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commander against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegate and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee thus excluded itself from the discussions that would be essential.
Course officers require that criminal prosecutions be suspended immediately.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legalization of protests
Young people from the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) are supportive of students.
The protests are merely the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of Youth of the Verdi Union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took action and caused the action of the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday at the Aktuelle Stunde television show.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the deputy CDU of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about student arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The left party filed a motion summarizing the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it had been known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weaponry, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of French science – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesdays of representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "close collaboration protocol".
The signatories were the Vice-Mari of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Anatoly Smimov Prefect of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the fully expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is located at the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnicals, the large Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armament research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Württemberg into a hopeless chaos of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway stations, with roads ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to get the locomotives from the back forward.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what to do.
That is why the line-head stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located at about half-way on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the line-head stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with highways and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new path from the inter-city line to Ulm.
It was taken away by regional and communal policies.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who costs the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe it the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which it was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - huge growth.
At that time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening traffic in goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and engaging in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the 180-kilometre Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be very urgent to lean on the fungus here thoroughly.
But the S21 project does the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is about to become the bottleneck of international goods traffic in the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 o'clock in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this period and attempts to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel parliamentary group invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Tarek Al-Wazir Greens, alluding to the Electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights by using "avocacy and roublarism".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely mistaken.
U.S. Banks Reimbursement of Aid
The big American banks, which are very affected by the crisis, lack their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the assistance provided under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to rid themselves of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the leaders and the higher cost settlement.
The Bank of America has launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors who have paid him $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the amount comes from bank funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, expressly thanked U.S. taxpayers: capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult time.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying out the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the strongest financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to make money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state custody.
As a result, the US bank could launch an increase in capital of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the limoing of the current position of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF's Berlinese writing, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm the manager of ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council expressed their support for the re-election of Brender and 7 others voted against it. Brender's removal by vote was a serious and predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to reschedule Brender to his position.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the listening rate of ZDF's information programs had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, waving the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had joined the debate and believed that Koch's way of doing things was unconstitutional.
But that wouldn't have been for nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhénanie-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became a editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (now newspaper).
Then his course continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the associate of the editor-in-chief of the time; then he corresponded to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (the bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin drafting.
After Brender's misfortune, while he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the employer's staff proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political personalities from the ZDF monitoring commissions.
Peter Frey, the probable successor of Brender had skillfully worked with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehementness in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as Liberal on the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: After one year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliative: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the rectors' conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload must be recognised to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have repeatedly expressed the expression in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", can be read in a document of about 30 pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chair of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the derailment, which had a significant impact on studyability.
Moreover, the "studyability" should be the decisive criterion of the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background need to be carefully examined to see if we can't avoid this choking sensation that we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and room for manoeuvre necessary to enable and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, however, which means that only in 2015 will all cycles be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on accreditation boards created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not overburdened and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, specialized universities and higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to give more means to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorial programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices and review offices and the international relations service
For this reason, the Länder and the universities plan a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, and the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions needs to be ensured and access to the Master needs to be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer happen in the future "late closed doors" of Ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Delegates of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the education and science union (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He claims the right and possibility for each graduate Bachelor to register for a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also requests that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students are provided with sufficient space for Master's studies and as good as possible conditions of study.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival to Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in bribs of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English professor in Bucharest and then a collection director in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received several literary prizes; in 1993 he held the chair very much coveted poetry of Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at Mousonturm's house in Frankfurt.
He had a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, the theme of which was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror distorting your security files".
Visiblely unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informant for security policy.
Söllner received the German language price in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
Rolling tests had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to withstand the security intimidation tests."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Nearly simultaneously with the honor of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary demiglés with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victims.
In his own Security file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He could have pulled it out of all the difficult situations at the time," said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Security had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed what real names were last hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
On the contrary, Germany, where the consultation of Stasi's files is a reliable process in the meantime, the attitude towards the legacy of the security records is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been constantly counter-carried and braking in the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council of the Birthler institution was established to work on the Assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has been rather delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of Temesvar Security who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expresses himself in a very denouncing manner to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and eventually she was questioned only once.
The infamous power thought it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many outstanding issues are associated with the Söllner case as they occur so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been stripped? The weighted reaction of the auditors, in Söllner's confession, hopes that the subsequent chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know that through accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Mobs at Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross coach went up at midnight less a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fiftieth anniversary could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk in happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's about to start.
The words of Switzerland that had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight not to go back."
The "big job" awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the champions' league daily.
And there will be a need to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three destiny goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11)
Sorting
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/game return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be shot in the lot on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the entry into the fulminant function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only to the one who had brought good luck, who had passed on to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a seamless motivation and pleasure to play.
I saw the players and told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "soul lead" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so but that did no more effects with the Babbel nurse.
He triggered a certain magic, told Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan - "in football when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tries to describe the " phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It's someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't gone through yet, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad wake in Leverkusen with 0:4 , object Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone through the hard way yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win for three months, is from the weekend events that a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the games was eliminated.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" in the context of Holdt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadrennials.
In any event, they agreed for the rest, that is, without the prior work of the group by the replacement coach, the strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" torturing Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
Heavyweight World Championship
Warm combat in Bern : Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his world champion title of heavy weights according to the WBC Federation version.
On the basis of unanimity of the judges, he imposes himself on points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as a world champion of heavy weights.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points of unanimity of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already twice won the World Championship of WBO and WBC Federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, confesses twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat at the 24th combat.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, on its left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller that, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the hits of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his right against dangerous.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He's still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, he went beyond Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko treating him as "vila zombie" who "is not really capable".
On Friday, the champion was unable to stop him from provoking Johnson by dropping his eyeglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko again imposed on himself in his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It seems that its promotional company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Gutenberg of lying in the case of Kunduz Affairs.
The SPD and La Lefte parties (die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After considering the latest information on the Kunduz Air Attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a countervergence" on the murder strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD chain information show "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the International Security Assistance Force rules in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Gutenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the target of the strike was in fact, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air raid that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left requested Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Greens Renate Künast party are of the view that Mrs. Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan Federal Government's policy if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellorship did not in any way influence the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more votes were being made to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to SPIEGEL, the information they had given Gutenberg about the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some disturbing details from the Minister.
However, in the vicinity of the two senior officials, they have been informed by the Ministry of Defence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have in the meantime asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred the following Wednesday to the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
There is only among the psychiatric patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can indulge without obstacles to the most crazy dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychiatric patients or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's at stake: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes encourages the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called vision, the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achethylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earthly Attraction Force no longer has power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always focused on the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make it up".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions with the colors created.
Earth's attraction has no power over it, it's flat to the ceiling.
He's feeling it.
Behind him are creatures of devil-allied, scrambled, bloody mouth, showing their teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain throughout the body.
Thunderous, mean, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo chain, in fact a loop and attach it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop breaks down.
Let this teach you a lesson, shout the voices in a heart to pull out the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first one of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitation, which make them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and ghosts from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Psychiatry Department of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is at the heart of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real context.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have severe brain damage.
Neuronal maturation of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral mother infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neural system anomaly occurs, and in addition to the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychosis trigger, however, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain is heated.
What's crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Mind".
Hallucinations are part of the common phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, as well as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain is heated but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimuli, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of participants acknowledge having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old and lives in a small town of Mecklenburg-Poranie before and goes to high school.
A young girl who's always normal, really.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, spoke to him.
When she answers her comrades, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a dreamy lunatic but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young friendly.
I'm crazy, she's wondering sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
The visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she happens to be unable to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she cannot often make the distinction if she is awake or already dreams, if the images she sees, the smiling faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, cry out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take her for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She had her pot last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact online with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimuli, the probability is that he will have hallucinations after some time.
I suppose the brain is not busy enough, making sure there is animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of the age of thinking, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form into the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychoses.
In contrast to schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, we have unfortunately quickly tended to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and physician head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of changing consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid vecus are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of consciousness oniroid occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies, as well as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mind boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, this is an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation of itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us, men, to avoid falling into the necessary of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his uniroidal experiences in his book "Heart Change" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious share of a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time his body is sentenced to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created of all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man nestled in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching over his health.
He lives in mid-age among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is taken by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a very different state, he writes in describing what he has experienced.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than real life.
The intensity of this experience gives rise to the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the onyroid deliriums, psychoses, hallucinations and psychiatric experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
First snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly determined to integrate the society, Hubert Burda said, 69, at Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
We will also need to see if they are able to do so.
You can't impose your children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to handle it.
This would tear down children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he had withdrawn from the position of President-Director-General since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
He then dealt with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a capital bubble, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I've never had a universal power dream, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the country's role as a precursor as Springer could and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the goal that seems to have been set El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to care and attention to the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, laser epilation specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a diet radius, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
In total, there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can enjoy the most innovative facial care, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them complete personalised treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having our body worked, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, luminosity or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Miscellaneous take-offs
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the take-off, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and establish mobility agreements, by carrying out procedures, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the views and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVEL Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has undertaken a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interviews "a future of tranquility" for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed "a future of peace" for the Spanish automotive industry which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Government President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan of the automotive sector, today we would have a abandonment landscape, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"With this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), has devoted EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government demand support measures, in addition to Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a “great increase” in registrations, which increased by “40 per cent” in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and car collections, but we can also find items of all kinds related to the engine world in ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sport spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine shut-down and start-up system on Mazda3, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 150-horse petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that everyone wants to overcome.
By continuing with the room, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this a large box of regular forms.
The engine shut-down and automatic start-up system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and the control of its consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the model that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive inner mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptable light bulbs and an audio BOSE system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do a lot of kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In contrast to this large amount, Mazda3 will give us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more of us than ever before, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at its e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
Indeed, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half what it costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American great-brother, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up the data when crossing a border or desperately look for a café on the Wifi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to consult their mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly seductive and it has been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a hardly noticeable effect.
Outside her country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device such as FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start to think differently and study various proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no galero.
This is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek already offers it to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the position of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, she did indeed choose the same to accompany him in the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: giving Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing towards the green with bright reflections, twice, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So, at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States follows the title of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to restore the same outfits.
But the fabric in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth for function, however, it carried a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden, model this time.
The hair has changed as well: the hair is now removed while the hair was released the previous time.
75% of working mothers had professional problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what is revealed by the study "Women's fertility and career in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted out of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years, does not leave any doubt: 75% of working mothers have had a limited career because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have unstable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, reject entry into marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed employment have their first child, on average 3.7 years after having settled together. This figure is going to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to achieve it, which has led them to reject the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exerted largely influences maternity, but less the date of common beginning," says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the age gap of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and their first child is late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who did elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have done middle or higher education invest this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year on, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, waving the universal motto "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, comes to join other celebrities listed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
UK fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, of yesterday and today, met for the annual award of their prizes, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" by writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not depend on the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not spare the losers or the lights.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without naming it: pleasure against evil fate, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre summits of universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best mountaineers still let go and always caught."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were to be grander."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry of confusion pushed from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he made it in the escape of himself and invoking postority with a violent speech to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she fell on her knees and prayed: "Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved Spenser's worms: "Sorry after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, fatigued death ravits."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edward VII was fighting him among the azalates or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What is Benet trying to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did he do if it was not to aspire to this man's glory to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-male, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six kilos, and without a word, they laid two feet at her that left the dog seriously injured.
Our anger is immense because we do not see what there is to be fun to assault a defenceless little animal for free, which was also left behind.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear them for her physical integrity, since an energum who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place about 17 hours, one Tuesday like another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the district police station even though we doubt that this is a good thing and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to treat a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wear
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet port, mainly among the younger bikers, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in case of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "is beyond the design and manufacture of ever more secure products" and stated that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheel helmet port incentive campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the comparison reference in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a reduction of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during those 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles have been sold (from passenger cars, pick-up cars, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853.
Large clouds that most affect their demand did not get away with it. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases thanks to external funding.
In addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic environment must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we reiterated the need for administration to focus particular attention on these vehicles and also on industrial vehicles ( trucks and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourist vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this took place with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure imposed by the European Union is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even though, through its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear-end shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system through the driver's footstroke.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
Aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four cases with injured persons would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device shall exert maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejected the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan was approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's application for Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is of importance.
In case there would be no agreement with either of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the steering wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to amcincate it with nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, first, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual down roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilos, use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, remove the air conditioning, 13 kilos, reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, mount sports bins, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replacing the door handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly crooked turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with a lead.
On the contrary: it was a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, capable of heating his muscles short speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will show on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Motor sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies engine rust, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether stopped or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road cover we travelled with the Spyder Boyxster was pretty damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants merely made an act of presence on the whole journey, while on certain turns we found verglas in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, the most fun to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Cocoon line icon and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer shows her face as a bad girl with as much restraint as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or It Girl is a Bag Girl.
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a 91-82 triumph during his visit to the Maccabi Electra hard field, despite the many absences of the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus at the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show which, with eight baskets at three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team had been marked since the perimeter, it was assumed that they had jumped on the Israeli soil with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclamations and applauses back to his old house, to increase their advantage at break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as his team's best player, with 13 points marked, although the "less six" of Splitter's assessment already suggested that tonight would not be the best of Brazilians.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the team of Avala wanted to remind Vitoria that we did not win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the benefit of yellows on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, injured but far from being dead, needed to chain some skilled actions to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas hand the counter over to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises succeeded in increasing at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fault, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got close at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory was in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece in front of the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Eurolige, during a match marked by the absences of players from the Unicaja, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and having a large budget.
The first-quarter-time game, allowed the Andalusian to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who blocked the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team started working by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury to the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The interior players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug advantage 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacus, who, despite the 19 losses, stood higher and even came to equal the difference of the dispute in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to chance.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved to be implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to resume the score at 81-62, thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted itself, accepting the victory of the Olympiacus.
How much should you be paid from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates user salaries from over 140,000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week now, the search engine has generally found that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement by the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
Based on the data available From its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34,247 gross annually in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros annual net, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The reversed President will have to abandon the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010 at the latest on the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of affairs of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that " Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in Brazil's embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the political exile condition that he intended to impose upon him the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets constituted the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions on a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, in order for financial institutions to purchase assets to be mobilised.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been almost completed and, without challenging their non-conformity liquidity policy, begin to put some sand into the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their one-year award next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing an inverse reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the standard levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize the private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again, there is a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a new revision to the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who were again trying to raise a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy that had curbed the destructive effects resulting from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore its place in power in the Emirs and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country in the euro area to fail to comply with its commitments.
On the other hand, it makes sense that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decrease and our differences continue to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our predictive indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, they do not hope much for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for now "cautiousness is a mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Sub-Commission of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched out for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, eight-closed.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million up to 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue changes, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that more than 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Government's draft Sustainable Economy Act is in line with what his business demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is a "long-term clear bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the market for the maintenance of Air Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on earth, will play the leading partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, is five years old.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Sharea fights its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site is an estimated tunnel of 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works company and motorway dealer.
The city mayor wishes to be able to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to US$ 1,700 million (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia are faced with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is run by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is built with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (filial of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of CSA), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market is promising large construction sites and privatizations, but entering is a major challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, mentioned above, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalided step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just acquired a place on this market by its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
millionaire assets
Actiona focuses on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for building and managing Adelaide's desalination maker, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the so-called Northern Link (northern link), is called to link the West Highway of Toowong to the Peripheral Road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this road toll will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief very fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the obtaining of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will enable 400 000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given up the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been entrusted with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is scheduled for early 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to Mrs Rushmore's agency, for a budget of about three million euros a year, the railway operator indicated.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies that have submitted to Renfe's call for tender, including four finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still a state enterprise has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivised.
An application store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary has followed the trail of other operators and opened an Internet app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At first, Orange's app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has contributed 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth positions of the clubs that have robbed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is on the top of the list.
Manchester United is on the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also billed the most money for their participation in the final Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atletico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate only received 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game they played.
There is also a victory bonus (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths of the final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in fourths of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça seized 2.5 million for winning the Europe Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The champion of the previous year accounts for 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers € 61 million for 29.9 % of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the stock offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 % of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Group of Jerez provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that it has made contact with the regulator.
If that were the case, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and judicial services of its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision made by the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sos reveals new diversions of funds in the coming months cannot be avoided.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday to the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the OPA for the exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory record submitted, as a result of the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the finalization of the offer, which he indicated was that the price had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate by hand the cost of repair between €20,000 and €30,000, including parts and labour may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest IT tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then to treat them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotif and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's business director, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car leaves the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphical image of each model is drawn on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car.
If this is a massively sold model, work can be ready within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information of 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
In order to carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audadex invests 90 million per year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of the scraps or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not propose it in our country, but she does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the lighthouse product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the painting scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open-source server to the Internet industry that allows for renting on vehicles that are declared to be broken.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific trade mark have gone to the garage for a breach or how many have suffered serious damage for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.

Internet auctions of injured cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimating and selling service is intended exclusively for industry professionals such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cassettes and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.

Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but, on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audadex company ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour prices, increases or reductions, and then print the quote to give it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audadex works to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
