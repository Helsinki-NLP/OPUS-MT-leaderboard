Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a windsuit (a combination of wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate Shrine, located more than 3,000 metres high, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While the planners of the U.S. road network have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the motorway infrastructure in decreption, many are those who come up with a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which record all the miles through a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government planning offices to revise the obsolete financing system for major American roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of major axes has suddenly led to a strong lively debate and lively alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road you travel on, and then use the information to write a bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles across.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental shift.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to begin recording the miles that each California car will be travelling by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by the American pump taxes, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they did before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the urban Liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce the build-up and emissions of gases, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate warming laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The open market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers paid on the mile.
"It's not just a tax drowning in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, policy vice president at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move on to the mile payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the Presidency of the Chamber killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to go to their work or in the city.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state for the cost of kilometres instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) investigates how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists had recently equipped their car with a device, the drivers were concerned that the government could follow their own actions and actions.
"Big Brother's concerns and these kinds of things are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs performance strategic management to the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to convert these devices into full localization devices."
There is no need to build a huge and overwhelming technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's day-to-day departures and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now going to find affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but not knowing the exact time or place.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-up from California named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to States.
She was seeking to enter the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have liked the planners of the major axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and don't locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by enabling devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "payment-to-conduct" insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered by the system," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wondered whether the entire debate on mile payment was simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay area, the officials say that Congress could just manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gasoline taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"It is not necessary to use radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listeners
The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury edition planned for November 4, with several unpublished.
Four have already emerged on the Toile.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, date 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real feast for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful safe in a video.
It introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and wallets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a highly mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished Already Listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informar is double-faced: a worrying intro before a light ride that slows down gradually to make room for a pop ball.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again made reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enticing, desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie is having fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-in informant, man on a rocket, potential marquen...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane characters.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not briefly released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not comply with the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including one soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist in Ontario, who had post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from the start, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine the latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in ranks, but who are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the required service time to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to prioritize tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet app.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled in 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, for children aged 2-7 years, tells the adventures of the Callie cat, sheriff of a city in western America where she makes the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice-President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published by Common Sense Media at the beginning of the week showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of those under the age of 2 have already been using a tablet or a phone, and 72% of those under the age of 8 years, compared to 10% and 38%, respectively, two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Intelligence Service whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide responses to their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the MP presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of spying and stealing State goods.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany were put to the test as a result of complaints that the NSA had made about listening to the German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who runs the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering it and completely ruining relations with the United States," he needed to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German Green Member, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that according to counsel from the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials – including the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix's on-demand video service via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary reported on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to highlight the most user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco's president and CEO Louis Audet in the interview.
Cogeco Cable thus leads its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date with regard to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers Telecommunications Giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service claims to be in discussions with some major cable carriers to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Fr.D. of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in his Speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channels packages doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that consultations by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CCTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy regarding television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decrease due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they experienced a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to up to 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet doesn't worry about seeing the number of clients fluctuating like that.
For me, this is not the indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very intense competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was detected in cans of beef products, sold by two small British low-priced distribution brands, today announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horses' DNA at 1% to 5%.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the British agency.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to examinations by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Just before 4:00 p.m., a motorist traveling north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not feared for their lives.
The traffic had returned to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay the baggage by hand
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers who carry hand baggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened cane with them to the descent of the plane.
The new hand luggage charges concern the bags placed in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding door.
Frontier's spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to pay this prize," she explained.
Air companies began paying for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these fees put as many things as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said that these new expenses will not really be used to collect money.
It's about getting the most loyal Frontier customers to understand that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's registration site and procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier's baggage charges will not be applied prior to the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often resent baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not affected baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost company Alligent followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the additional costs.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit's hand baggage charges reported $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the costs of unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career," he said.
I was expecting to see tooth scratches and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning".
Border also does as Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier has indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cane with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for hand baggage costs when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them rather than to contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, she reduced the premiums by thousands by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1 000-mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase their tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home city, Denver, but his activity retreats and he loses money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republic has tried to improve Border Finance by selling the airline.
NSA challenges an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for the breach of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the public site to break for a few hours, not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," the spy agency reported in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the breach was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least one online hacktivist group claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to inundate a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, once known as the "No Such Agency", found itself under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national and foreign levels – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former NSA's failed consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who are going to turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees go.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, met employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," says the Regional Director of Work Relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The Delta's closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he was investing in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employees"
After casting the sponge with failure in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site of Amiens-North promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire Titan, is now ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the factory purchase project in January, you are back today.
You had made violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fous" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, he is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs from the best paid ones.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours disabled in France.
In India, China and other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a fair price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the factory was announced, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys Goodyear the closed factory.
As a result, Titan could move machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from around 1,200 of Goodyear's current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of length of employment when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to agree with the CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in North Amiens for more than four years.
The benefits of Bombardier are declining, while deliveries and orders of aircraft are declining
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft would meet its ambitious trading schedule by September.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft only stole three times, and then the question arose whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not in line with the forecast and the stock prices declined by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his score on Thursday from "superperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock exchange in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the margin of benefit in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far up to 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential for new line aircraft economies.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
Leaders also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was progressing in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's shutdown time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and to plan for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was assessing the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information over the next few months.
"This slow flight test – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal calendar – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a 10-cent result per share and revenues of $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported delivering 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 one year earlier.
The net controls fell to 26 planes, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division represented $32.9 Md as at September 30, unchanged compared to December 31 of the previous year.
"In the Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautic revenues decreased by 13% to $2 Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that revenues from this division had increased from almost 11% to $2.1 Md.
The Transport Division's order card totaled $32.6 Md as at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered performance problems concerning some major contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The Bombardier Action Course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit on the board, fell from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazil's company Embraer SA, the world's third aircraft manufacturer and nearest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a gauze under Crolles' tooth since Thursday night, learned Friday from the Speleo relief of the Island.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri in practice and the other no, had left underground on Thursday about 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, the same source has been specified.
"The speleologists should have emerged around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Speleo rescue organization.
Tens of people on site
About 20 rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," says Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They lost themselves in the network, turned back on their steps while waiting for the rescue, specified the prefecture.
Refuelled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalist union invited its members on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services after further revelations on the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and couriers until new orders," she said in a press release.
It considers Washington Post's "scandalous" information, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headsquars (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Painted Dates: A Member Requests Brigitte Gruwels' resignation
The draft by the Minister Brigitte Gruwels of "relevating" signals poles in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project in central Brussels on Thursday to repaint 16 signals poles of the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal being both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repaint all Brussels signals at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamming" of the capital and demands Brigitte Gruwels' "dition".
"It is not happy to spend the money of the Brusselsers madly in relief operations of the flagposts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Gruwels continues his Flemishing Operations of the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her black-yellow-yellow-yellow taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who owns the NVA program.
It's a long time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Gruwels was elected with only 2,245 votes 0.5% of Brusselsers!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico de Pont-de-Buis demontée
The eco-tax porch of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national was diverted in the wake.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the Prefect of the Finistère Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomouv, the portico manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports to operate in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed online glasses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibre or an intra-auricular earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him at the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep dating.
There is no recipe, no mode of use to pass the invisible wall and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, placed on the table at night.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle against cancer.
That's at least what I thought on the day I found her body empty, crawled on this hospital bed with frozen sheets.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of candles that frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that believed in mourning.
And then she turned out to me while revealing my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This diversion from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" he seemed.
I've always been told.
I never believed him back then.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, lending my body to him.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, recommended.
I don't know who said dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mean: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream of them constantly, perhaps not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always something that prevents me from doing this.
I often wake up anxious when it comes to me and I feel deeply absent.
Sometimes, some dreams take me on the contrary, and they fit into my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I was supposed to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was waking up, I was going out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was smiling and glad I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with me what was coming.
Of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am delighted to share this common memory that lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused at the young bachelor's house that I was at the time.
I've done my grief pretty quickly, though.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, have not been, with the decline, anodized choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and rightness of the spirit of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes on me.
My mother died 17 years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that triggers alone, anywhere, whenever, in unusual places, moments incongruously.
Then time calmed down.
It was only the lack, the lack of response, the need for it, to entrust me, to reassure me at the bottom of its sweetness.
Yet, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes laying upon me, I see the circles that glaring her gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, the folds that mark the front of the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes around.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
That was his promise on his pain bed, so we little by little got back to smiling, and saying his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to him in the dark when absence hurts too much, she invites herself in my dreams when morals are a little bit reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was the conductor and we are trying to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take it out of your heart and memories.
In some ways, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 following asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my own beliefs sometimes different from his own, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, he'll always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The huge penalty that then invaded me has, of course, eased but it's always close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that in the wake I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was doing well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in the wind, anxious and turned on the hair lamp by looking everywhere, convinced that it was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I go back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his mind lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since I left, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a professional responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008.
Baghdad published on Friday official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication shall take place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants US assistance.
"We do not tell the world to be by our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's going on in Iraq is not settled, it's going to spread, and what's going on in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki expressed himself at the United States Peace Institute, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three-year imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Seats
A major defence attorney, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough on investigations into his drug-related activities after he had compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was known as "Bash" and regarded by criminals as a "priority file", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officials found Sarborough, 32 years old, dropping three sacks of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, her wallet and her credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £1.5 million, as well as more than $200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals because he feared that his addiction would not be revealed in the big day.
Today, at Liverpool's sitting court, Ditta, who works in Forbes Solicitors' law firm in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being convicted of two charges of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, at 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at Ewood Park football stadium, the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, her wallet and her credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had talked to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he was called by clients for legal matters.
However, the court heard testimony that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of which it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "If anyone needs to know that there is no need to violate the law, he's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of becoming too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications would undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He has become too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and has compromised his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has passed from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he began to take drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and made it vulnerable to the background of the leaders of organized criminal groups who commissioned it to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three chiefs of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning for criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will take place on December 21st at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
Ms. Franklin spoke in November about recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering, the famous performer of Respect had stated to the media on 16 October that the side effects of treatment she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of seaboard covered with a light coat: you could rub the warm blow in Menton with the bill of lighting.
An invoice which, unlike many communes, is further regulated by taxpayers, not trade associations.
To ease its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. Local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator of the shooting.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classic song for teenagers
Each time, the school clientele will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five diners imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor allow adolescents to appreciate classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Kingdom Lyrics Society will return with its Lyrics Destinations, a formula that now fills the Chicoutimi Pulperie.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities was the lyric Apéro, the concert-beneficie held last August, with the competition of the colourful soprano Marie-Eve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air from La bouillon.
Without providing specific figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is well-designed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"Finances are floating and we hope to last up to the 50th anniversary of the operation, a step that we will be going through in seven years," said the administrator.
"I'd say even beyond," added CEO Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostages, kidnappings, threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to de-start the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Package.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective redress against the Saint Croix brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor Brother Submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was for only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" explains lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both cases.
The collective appeal that has just been filed is a particular feature of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of Saint Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological restraint on the victims", that they "are aware of sexual abuse and have nevertheless choked them", and that they have "sciently and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is admitted by the Court, the second stage is held, namely, hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle in a friendly manner before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the LaSalle district in Montreal on Thursday night through Friday.
The rescue was called around 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were sent to the premises spent about an hour in control of the brazier.
The fire caused "significant damage to the structure of the building," indicated the chief to the operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty houses, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM indicated.
A lot of opposition to medical aid to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is held this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care House Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be in any way useless.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick First, believes that Quebec's bill disorients the population with regard to the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
The Kenyan press is ignoring the controversial law on the media
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He indicated that the new media court "will always be biased as it is a government extension" and that content and advertising restrictions would affect Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "media support." The Standard stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and forged the bill calling it "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is accompanied by a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate Trade Centre last September.
Kenyan media has provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack were so-called the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the call was withdrawn following a riot of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "done" or being unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, political men would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and collecting."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their winding wages of about 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A hard year for pharmacists
The departure of close to 10 pharmacists from the Laval Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a lot of excitement to the head of the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement leave, maternity leave or short departures, the pharmacy department has found itself highly deficient in staff.
Almost 30% of the staff needed, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSS has decided not to hire an independent labour force, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use the clearance, explained Mrs. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the institution have been streamlined or reduced, as long as things are replaced.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] in order that they come and stay here.
There is a competition in circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in the service of the CSSS.
Now, it's a lot better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains sensitive.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in the hospital or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always ride three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, we had a lot more, and there are no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema by the little door.
Director Lars von Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomaiac, his next film.
This porn drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two sections (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrennial add to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's appearance with his elder is striking: a toast silhouette, a diaphne dye and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put naked on ice paper will be displayed in much more sulfurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaiac caused the temperature to rise on the Toilet: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their powder in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it's the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, passing Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses into their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
One room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following pickets at the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility ordered the chamber to be evacuated and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the bottom of teardrop?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always that the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in full.
The room was airborne and everything came into order.
The cinema was able to resume its rights and customers were able to regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruit
Taking advantage of Halloween's day, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine hidden into the country at Montreal-Trudeau Airport on Thursday morning.
It was during the passenger baggage examination that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed in three citrouli having been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of narcotic drugs.
Air raid against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range surface-air missiles SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's flight into Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances almost identical to the one that had taken place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed an Israeli attack at CNN, this time targeting Yakhonn land missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's note of public debt securities goes to "B-", which is based in the speculative investment category.
It has a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance in three that it will again be lowered in one year.
"The government's strategy is increasingly likely to guarantee sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have massive recourse to support the local currency, hryvnia, collapseing, the agency increasingly considers a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious with Kiev's will to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the following day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered from its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has not yet released $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing the price of gas to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external funding needs" were "vulnerability", while "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with the presidential elections scheduled in 2015, the expert, interviewed by the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels calls for the release of opponent Iulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fear Moscow's "commercial restrictions".
Russia, which represents the quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire at Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus bringing closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third one, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the time-limit for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," both groups announce in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional upon obtaining other regulatory authorisations and approval of shareholders of both groups," they add.
The Congolese army hunts the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the rebels from M23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears about to be beaten after being driven from the north-east regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he had been in control of the insurrection 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and house it wherever it hides because it is criminal," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson of the FARDC.
We must not allow them to be reorganized because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the villages under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military reverses would not change his claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, chief of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall in Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staffing, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC Staff was remodeled and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to touch at its end," predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in fighting a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accused Rwanda, which falsely denied it, of military support for the M23, consisting of former Congolese mutineers.
British diplomacy leader William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shells in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived one year with the M23 and it seemed impossible for us to be one day liberated by the army," testifies a resident of this neighbouring town of Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," said this man.
The tests carried out by the Pastoral Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus were negative, announced by the Ministry of Health.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refinery margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining withdrawn from the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, increasing compared to 2.52 million bpj produced a year ago.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from $45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit falling despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been requiring from the beginning of the school year fees of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from two-resident school transportation, a service offered by the organization when it is in a position to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," says Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to work together and find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the shading carried out for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "declare the timing of the project's implementation, and in particular the date of the closure of emergencies that will not be possible on 4 November".
An official request "to take no risk of emergency management in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed to avoid disturbing the PS campaign to a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even though the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings to the emergency facilities of the Hotel-God will have all received to carry the thirty serious cases daily to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-God, emergency wards will leave place on Monday to five general medical wards.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the current of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says Loïc Capron, the president of the PHCP's medical commission of establishment (CME), which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, will he also ensure.
But it is up to the RSA to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things are doing progressively," said Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for the ARS, who, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or lied to him," Gérald Kierzek laments.
He resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the sling against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renewed less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly fattened.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the Lariboisere emergencies.
The ARS argues that 30 "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent an "advancate" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
At the RSA as well as at the APHP, the "new hospital model" has already been launched since 7 October, which is expected to continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also be involved in the establishment of an "exambulatory care stay".
"Where we're going if we ask people to self-diagnosis," Gerald Kierzek asks who "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen like for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the armrest, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, an adviser to the UMP of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, he clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if they were returned to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, PS candidate, recalled again on Monday morning on France Inter that she had acted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that was the case, she would have made her disagreement clear, said Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable schedule of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama ends the IMF and World Bank hearings
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, indicates an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hands in the case of NSA hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank monitoring has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
When asked about it, one U.S. administration official replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance for World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Expressing itself under the seal of anonymity, the person responsible did not specify whether such supervision had been established in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as that at the end of the hearings of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and have imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "overstep national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These DDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who was toiling them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes against a T-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd crowded on the place of Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there have been reports of reports of conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo, the worst hanging since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 Md of investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italie and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the root of recent clashes and has launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize the concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces left to him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga said that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open and specialist university speaker from Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the votes collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term of office next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led to disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located hundreds of kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was quite shy when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is the latter to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestor, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as " lifestyle models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not weigh against the subtle russian, while the arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland recommended a "mindful selection" of the works adapted to age.
"I find it great that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "completely catch up", the messages being "subblished" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended well, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The well-known basis for what we show and what we don't say.
One Hamas-armed fighter was killed tonight and another was injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, and medical and security sources were learned in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian and Israel when they dried up an Israeli armoured shell.
NSA espionage: The United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the field of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the intercession by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this will no longer happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London where he participated from Washington on Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry ensured that the US authorities had since played out numerous attacks projects through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," said the US diplomat.
And, John Kerry said to Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"Yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and undertake a review of these practices so that no one would feel wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to rage this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former consultant of NSA Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR", and led with the British NSA counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by internet giants.
Some 181 million items had been collected during the last month of January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this issue, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized of these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be about "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would not absolutely target Europe, said General Alexander.
And the controversy was spreading in Asia on Friday.
Indonesia called upon the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of an extensive international spy network that has also triggered China's area.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without his master's help, the injured Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, announces the League 1 club in a press release.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco as a difference of goals, broadcasted the list of players selected for the 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqué simply states that it is "stricken", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee on his return of selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the creamized dead
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased creamized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, is to attend, and will then explain at a press conference his proposals on funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own objects, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsequies of a close relative, it is the opposite: the French prefer the burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cream.
In his book La Mort en ashres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee of Funeral Ethics, stresses the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which relates to "the elimination of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still ill-lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approving Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to appreciate it.
Approving the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would have been entitled with a burial.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a strong commitment to organizing the ceremony.
77% of French want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to hold a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For some ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handing over of ashes," said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer master ceremonies, which proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: hosting the assembly, appointing the deceased, linking him to others, recalling him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that Father Lachaise's crematorium has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of memory, both secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who were creamized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast in line, to those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the relocation due to rats turns to controversy
In the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, that the couple and their three children be accommodated in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the Office Director.
Rats, there's always been rats in the cities.
The derailment undertaking carries out two steps per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have made 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not push into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, clearance products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, one child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats at our house," defends the father of the family who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the noise and are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline in the dollar against the yen, which was detrimental to the export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped from more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house caught by flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that triggered on Friday noon in the Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were sent to Hébert Street on 9th.
The flames appeared in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminary.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firemen, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took strength to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for firefighters in Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, Vaudville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the poster heads emerged in Carolines, and had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have been through non-traditional circuits, for example showing shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable chain ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football cheerfully lascivious of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but is still best known for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville, downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comical DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would come down a street between two buildings and he would say, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil continues to decline and approaches $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing sector is increasing.
The US reference gross price for delivery in December fell from $14 to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow steadily after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Issued Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal restored certain restrictions to the right of voluntary abortion that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and calling the right to abortion largely into question will be able to enter into force.
The court of appeal judgment means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have to have a "privilege of admission" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a hospital nurse, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
IMG defenders argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court of first instance had found that the provisions concerning the privilege of admission were unconstitutional on the eve of the law.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is at the governor's office, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the trial judgement that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has successfully returned to force, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, which is 5.6% from the audience.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates took part in the 10th season hearings to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement to find their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored during this first prize.
Like every year, the first audition shows are a wide selection of weed singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes have even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision on Thursday requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed it from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the appeal filed by the city.
The judge had held in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city called for its conclusions and remedial orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the record because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the critics of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by misappropriating black men and Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where most controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons whose case is dismissed after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls registered has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
partisans who advocate changes in the NYPD's control and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, make it possible to have more effective and reliable police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the police's morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Renters must go to the vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes to the City for taxes.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 million to $5 million in case...
Let's vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef cook of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of the Élysean kitchens as committed after having worked in embassies, the cook climbed all the steps until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, through Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of greats in this world in a quasi-anonymous that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The open-faced man, skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!", ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Don't mind the heads of state who showed a relative indifference to earthly food, "they're all greedy," openly denounced Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, "he's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime request".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the State dinners in Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in my heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said hi.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in the Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-bedroom building, located on rue Hébert's 15th Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire service.
The fire came forward, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house was home to four houses, but no tenant was in the place at the time of the fire.
The damage was very limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the saboteurs have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: Exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out a few images of his next film, whose role-title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is framed by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decoy you in his role as a defunct trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island stock market broker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a large corruption case on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then climbed a cliff that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzy fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is chaining parties, women, drugs.
Decency and excesses of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took a delay due to its installation too long.
It looks like the film lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the race to the oscars.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a canon pipe on a link involving the then-executing Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC stated to the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and to "plant at all times in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three ways to investigate issues: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about wire hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, "Of course it is."
The rumors about a link involving Clarke were first repeated by the NotW editorial office when a source, having a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
One band, on which were recorded voice messages hacked on its phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Ms. Pawlby's oversight of the minor acts and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as other important men, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr.Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defensive Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to have conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to doing telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in the throes of violence
The U.S. President was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of US assistance to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most deadly month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher assessment of 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nuri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence is causing a renewed apprehension while neighboring Syria is in the midst of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are killed in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was perpetrated against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), an affiliated group in Al-Qaida (Sunny extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nuri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of interviews in the United States of Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki that will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At that time, the American President, elected on the promise to put an end to the military commitment in that country, had set an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nuri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the Congress electors.
Thursday, he pleaded for the international community to lead a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nuri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectoral and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nuri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighour group of Tiananmen's attack
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang Ouighurs separatists on Friday of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, has darkened over the crowd that was on the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and has caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau on Homeland Security Affairs, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan as the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighours, a Turkish-speaking minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are fuelled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kongese Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, as his words were repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighour origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican tests contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun to conduct a large worldwide survey of how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the ties of marriage.
The survey was sent to each national conference of bishops in mid-October, with the task of getting as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate way to sound the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, or a few hundred combatants, were located almost 2000 metres above the farm hills of Chanzu, Runonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue even at night," a Jumba resident told the AFP, on the phone at around 12.30 p.m., saying that a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of confrontations has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have turned the rebels back a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "past night" in Jumba before going up front for a "ratification operation".
It was very clearly heard behind him about small arms-fed cracks.
From Bunagana, political fief and last strong place of the rebellion on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonation.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDC had "circling the residual M23 positions to delocate them".
Since the resumption of Friday, clashes between the March 23rd (M23) Movement and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fights, but provides key support to government troops in intelligence, observation and planning.
By the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-stocked in ammunition, were on their way to the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, civilian-aided soldiers carried a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure the rise of another device flying the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels on Wednesday evening to "disarm themselves voluntarily" in order to be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result for now.
On the spot, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only at Uganda's mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without the immediate confirmation of this information on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which is refuted by Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5,000 people had been displaced between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC which had begun in the morning reversed at noon.
"This morning we went through to go into our fields, but the military told us to retreat," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on his back.
It seems like fire strikes are approaching populations.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take their wings.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: French music is a successful genre.
Long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts would stop in the ridiculous.
And the successes like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the gift.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first takes over, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success so hard conquered.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve on the part of producers...
Some use beautiful pictures and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old back bond on the pretext that we can serve about anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
Afterwards, we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes English-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Spider Woman" or "Spring Eve" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists that are turning projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-roadway...
The living of talents is also a consequence of the number of positions to be filled.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Providing beautiful young men (often talented) in the lead of a musical show is the assurance of a taste of these girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are carefully held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise rose up in Paris and enjoyed by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning about 5:30 a.m., on the Brussels inner ring at Hoeilaart, heading for Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is compensated.
The ring was closed at traffic until 9 a.m. at the location of the accident, as long as the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation did not, however, cause little bottlenecks because the accident occurred at the time of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was seriously injured following an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Caribbean Pirates" attraction.
It was closed to new orders.
DRC: The Army Prepares a New Attack
Children play on a carbonized armour that belonged to the rebels of the M23, in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in the eastern part of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to delocate the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall out of her own way.
It will remain only the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been located almost 2,000 metres up on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Jumba
In Jumba, a resident who had reported near combat on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot injured, and three others were injured, including a severe evacuation by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the PSA.
Since the resumption of the fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not given any record of the loss of human life.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation led to an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of Intelligence, again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "stolen the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a whistleblower, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on words.
Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. storage service providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever triggered the paranoia of companies in relation to state surveillance.
The revelation that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY board.
However, in all of Mr. Snowden's documents, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German parliament member says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of American spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock to some companies who thought that China was at the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a Cloud Security Alliance survey, a professional organization reported that about 10% of non-American members gave up their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the American Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF chemical manufacturing society.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally not inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB key at a professional show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, says that collecting mobile phones before council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid during their trips abroad due to the risk of reaching the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were second-degree guilty of committing acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company considered that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former French Interior Intelligence Director, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who died under unusual circumstances think that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in the gymnasium of his high school, believe that their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a supported carpet standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
The investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family disagreed with these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, representative of Kenneth and Jacquelineyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
"They think that this challenges all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered solely for the purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their sons to school with a poster and they were brought into a mortuary bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to provide all video surveillance recordings that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes guidance on children's allergies to schools
Wednesday, the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies has risen significantly.
One in 20 children in the United States are suffering from food allergy today.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
He also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the self-injector of the EpiPen brand being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily of the epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the feeling that something is beating my tongue," "I have the feeling of having a hair on my tongue" or "I've got kicks on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How to explain the French government's contradictory attitude, which on one hand went public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World at a few weeks of interval on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the American power, this constitutes an important enlightenment.
When we describe the American systems of interception against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to irreverent us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The establishment of technology tools for the United States, but also France, for the last ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, on the other hand - it has already been said - the Americans can provide information to the French about other regions of the world.
Therefore, the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have interception tools, that the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the question of infringements of freedoms.
What do the United States really risk a degradation of their image?
We've got good news of them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The American risk can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are demanding, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American suppliers subject to American laws, and therefore to the NSA's power.
Last element: the broad movement of revelations committed by media from around the world, which helps trigger a debate on practices of intelligence surveillance until now almost non-existent, could motivate legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexed children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female gender of newborns will no longer be strictly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to enter a "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, concussioned and balked.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexity being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term designating persons with chromosomes or atypical gonades (ovary or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best information available to assign it, then wait for and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Jack Drescher, New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law "seemed to be a good idea."
Intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that consists of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young boys of a non-conformity now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian named Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this land-based Catholic country signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, a baby's mother also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And only about ten years ago, the medical community regarded the genus as an adorable, which can be erased and on which we can redesign.
But now, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors can sometimes deceive themselves, not knowing how a child will feel about his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He dedicated the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/John", his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a small boy whose penis had been cut off during a broken circumcision to have him castrated completely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he remarried a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher stated that some doctors "always repeat this model".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say, "They are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something wasn't going, he asked for his medical file.
What he found he horrified.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director general of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Reported Choice, fears that German law "invits labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth.
This is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Bartz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law will "responsive" parents and children.
Dr Baraz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or portable mothers.
"The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don't have to make early decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a period before entering "male" or "female".
So everything's fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that's something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and the right within the coalition in power near the vote of the Senate to unravel Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left center leader says he has "firmly intent" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw support from the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, decides its dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last his refusal to give in to the Berlusconi injunctions that already wanted the cabinet to fall.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to an appeal of "many wounded".
"The law enforcement is on site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while the images of television show people evacuated into ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesperson from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told the AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a rampart, and a second person transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 p.m. locals (12.30 p.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that the two and three are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights upon arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tanks killed a Palestinian Islamist militant from Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, learned after sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secret, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's 2012 campaign book "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told on Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out "in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were waning.
According to the Times Policy correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing the Vice-President with the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the poll.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been carefully kept within the Chicago campaign GQ and within the Oval Bureau.
Only about half a dozen of the president's close advisers – including Daley, Obama Jim Messina's former campaign leader and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley took the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal links", before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley said in the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in shape, and so he was saying, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley was qualifying for the "counsel" exam, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his employer was aware of any change.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" was not answering the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
You want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball thus costs me about £ 140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands as a musician breaking the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was tai chi's master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before she died, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their Springs house (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are citizens, this is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver graft last May.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more penniless.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it again this year.
But the states show that I'm the Welsh sheep when we talk about Halloween.
Most Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million on candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises should represent $1.2 million out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's all right to stay traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed up in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't brag.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 million on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, napkins, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and we are not telling stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery that I haven't come to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you stepping on that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment of the style "beautiful head".
Finally, let's talk about citrouli.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Citrus One when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped lemon, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've done since we were very small.
Fortunately for us, the "citrouille baby trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Citrus- lanterns that slowly float on the porch of your house were probably coming from Illinois, where 542 million citrus fruits were grown this year.
If you're looking to make more of yourself, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg lemon.
In-house Royal Bank of Scotland will create a "bad bank" structure of 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and speed up its reversion.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtable assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned up the bank within three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubtable claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of getting involved in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and about 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said the new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsoring of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point harness seats and belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options included improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, the Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the United Kingdom and internationally, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of raid rallies.
We have had a lot of pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornic in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaghetti, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was found three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the career
Firemen came down in remembrance along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover him safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable ascent of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month Spanish cocker, escaped after an accident on the road Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire's Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought their lost dog and launched a call on social networking sites after she disappeared into the career following an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp view walking his dog found Ruby on a cornic in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team at Cleckheaton's firehouse rushed to the ground and came down to recall to save Ruby using an animal sink to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to get rid of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't first think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and she had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters were good.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, pop star said she was a choreist on Jagger's "Old Habits Die Hard" song in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he tricked me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "disclaimedly denied having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charters this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security body boss on a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official designates a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighours from the same family in the Xinjiang Muslim-dominated region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with fuel canons against the entry of the banned City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, former Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among Al-Qaeda affiliates.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish people the choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Trade Area in order to be able to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper has indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it did not appear in the major titles (and that was to be expected).
Neither has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when they arrange them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from Scotland.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke against Brussels, in particular now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the major post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely dead.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties opposing the EU or militating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency gain ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes during the September federal elections and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the heavy burden on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis in the euro has little to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits – that was true only for Greece.
Rather, the European system has had to weigh on its members the exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a national currency devaluation, the countries of southern Europe face an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in salaries and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper imbalance in productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the consumer's expense – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a cost-related drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage gels in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
Consequently, the revolt rages, particularly in France, one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy badly to move.
As a result, the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrage – a timely warning for the British Labour Party which reminds it that it cannot start from the principle that a split on the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-Money and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and single anti-money feeling in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the free Europe of Nations (sovereign) favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I look forward to the United Kingdom taking its distance from this project, and I hope that it will look gently in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left on track in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England region (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to walk Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could agree on a more free European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is to be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that has the best success in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Equiquiquire, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former correspondent is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair begin to grow to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that took place this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Pedocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time in reassuring parents," said Kaplowitz. "It doesn't usually indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty."
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budging, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and a small size at adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that "the control of puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they're going to manage hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frightened school and was upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 who linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate, by genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger puberty area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and infants.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"That may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen Brothers, Grand Prix of the Last Cannes Festival, is a fun and nostalgic film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that began to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography had just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had rallied the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the Peter trio, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their return on the American movie star Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the movie, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich circles of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less attractive clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury owed to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week the troubles of a folk singer who can't get through and angry with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements on his feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, this is what interested us in: a mixture of mischief, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a career worker but an integral one, with self-destructive behaviour," declared to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers of folk music built their story on real personalities of the day like the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentary allures, from the 33T-invasive dusty music label sold by an old, unpaid secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where singers were.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who passes through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with a scary look, companion of fortune from Llewyn Davis.
Questioned how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "grown in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be regarded as good", "unfortunate can also launch someone's career," and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise everything about his music, star pop explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
Phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated him to "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, theatre of the 198 and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was traveling with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"There is no doubt that between 120 million and 150 million countries are all confused," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a Foch Avenue building near the Arc de Triomphe, the maleic eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, drawing a stack of books on the table between bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 arpent countries to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the picture of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, adisgent Austrian aristocrat and a contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself at the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zesty of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send a message.
He was working "like the great reporters of earlier war, like Albert London, who went on site and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS' father said "make a kind of geopolitical leaflet."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, and people of the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
Hence, many of its SAS are often pre-monitoring: thus, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several high officials, he had told the story in "Le Chemin de Damas".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980 he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 of jihadists based on the capital of Mali.
I am not guessing, was defending Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips in often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his marguerite IBM writing machine dating from 1976 "of which all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords are attached to the walls of his office.
Regularly pushed for machoism by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are complaining about the width of seats while large controls are at stake
The dispute rages between the large aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, opening the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dubai air salon that takes place this month.
The conflict focuses on the width of the proposed seats on long-haul flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortlisted by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as airplanes are seeking to sell even larger versions of their long-haul bimotor planes, possibly waiting for a record of controls during the event to take place from November 17 to 21.
The way in which seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its "777X" remodeled can accommodate 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautic giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to understand recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Will you accept that?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in tighter seats than in regional turbopropeller planes," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats on planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-corrier journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American size of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a concept of headquarters dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly called jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study indicating that an additional inch at the seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the width of seats and asserts that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that the cabin experience did not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do in order to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race on aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at market price in the coming decades, sufficient to cover the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first mentioned in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a yield per seat in their latest models of long-corrier bimotors 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to be able to house more seats and make its planes more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that booths set up with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are going for a denser configuration, which can go with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
Air salesmen who travel around the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger side-facing seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large equipment, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautical industry to establish a standard of size for seats ends, but that he could forget the sales wave of 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the compensation proposal for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just auracious of the victory of his ship at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had received a negative vote on his remuneration.
The Oracle boss resigned a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but perceived approximately $77 million related to stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
On the whole of the 2013 fiscal year, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5% while the course of Bond Stock Exchange of 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence on their lives.
Other tests are needed before testing on human beings, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will be able to help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular antibody flow.
The antibodies trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before reaching the brain, thus preventing the smoker from having a dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the mice that were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice who had not been vaccinated "were calm," said researchers, signaling that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely that it is used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will take no pleasure in it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habits," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit by an American drone Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has already been announced many times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which was carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
On the eve of the day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (IAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr.Obeid had pressured several government ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any calls for tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr.Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of former Deputy Secretary General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be the subject of an invitation to tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which related to the Obeids approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any calls for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to IACC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr.Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under the orders of Mr.Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, that wasn't it.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says one responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried air raids on missile cargo in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently considering the possibility of setting up a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criterion to prevent visas 457 from being used to occupy unskilled posts or as a means of diverting his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government discourse on foreign workers, saying he could offend the neighbours of Australia.
"The failed statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artefact.
The working paper lists 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are being examined.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring undertaking".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The 9-year-old son of a man was traveling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 is opened in 2026.
The Minister of Baron Transport Kramer said that the project "would bring together the United Kingdom".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown called himself "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British government, in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the duration of journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it has are enormous.
Without him, we are faced with a capacity problem of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "unmistakably" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British Ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps."
The rules on the use of on-board electronic devices remain for now in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US gesture to ease the regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers consider the decision that obliges American carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it reviewed the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft on aircraft," she said.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety on a permanent basis and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but stated that she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our planes," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it is currently in compliance with the current rules.
"According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA decision and its reasons.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand baggage transportation programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will require passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia has experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people according to the testimony collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rixe involving several people broke out on the side of the Poste.
At least four slight injuries would be regrettable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore pledge lenders take advantage of the medium classes that are forced to tighten their belts
At the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga places a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her girls' tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went inside," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, became the third credit loan company to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Donating jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms.Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore bond lenders take an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not asking for creditworthiness checks or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to mortgage lenders while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and overindebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit powered by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to bond lenders to bridge the gap while their economies are experiencing a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the increasing debt of households, mainly resulting from the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of debt to households/gross domestic products in Asia.
Malaysia is leading the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [wages scale] are looking to supplement their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have led people to hurry to wage their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the items in the 200 city's loan stores are in gold.
People say, "the price of gold is high, let's get the chain in grandpa's gold and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest stock market operator has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores over the past few months.
The increase is such in the sector of the loan on pledge that ValueMax, the shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops such as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will finance them by using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have swung out the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that borrowing not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage goods they already own, and monetaryizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she said.
Wages are being better accepted socially as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
The people who go to the lenders on pledges are not only those who have financial problems.
People from Singapore also go to the ValueMax loan stores to buy gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs to pass a difficult heading," says Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who dealt with young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor worked, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes into Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before he gets rid of it.
A man dressed in a barred Nazi uniform of a brassard with the game cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it arrives, it was already gone without bursting," she added.
I was doing the tail when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were a good mouth.
"You don't get out of the street like that unless you want to draw attention," testified a client, 60-year-old Rosina Rusin in Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as monsters, but it was difficult to know if it was a canicular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armrest twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining that I have "mental problems".
Savings plan of $325 million for the health system in Tasmania
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the wavering health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year funding was decided upon after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Pibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
Additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-scheduled clinics in Hobart and Launcheston, with better external care, training of medical managers, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the health system in Tasmania," said Pibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania."
However, he congratulated the Government for having responded to the request for urgent assistance that it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system in Tasmania from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "lucky solution".
"The reason we're here is that the state labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government that rips up almost half a million dollars and the Commonwealth pays $300 million, and claims it's a rough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Pibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
While in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the endless cruelty of a Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never comes into lubricating or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the surveillance agency
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons surveillance agency on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with an advance day on the deadline of the
1 November established by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made while the fighting was raging on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapon production unit and storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human balance sheet through a Syria-based network of activists, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces found death, of which 18,678 were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and about 5 375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fights emphasized the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they must complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within a short period of time.
A statement from the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the critical production declared and the machines for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites, according to Syria, were "abandoned and...that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which had been inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Safira's unit was one of the two sites that IAEA inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the IAEA Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coast province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed against one of the bombers in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence imposed on the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the bombings.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacks on two overnight boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges relating to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, qualified as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators about 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the execution squad," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outdoor parked van, exploded just after 23 o'clock on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a backpack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He collapsed in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – which were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounded hundreds of others, that's not a lot.
Patek is the last of Bali bomb owners to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden with a view to re-establishing links between South-East Asia terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was mocking himself with the grief he could have caused to others.
The verdict was given on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek, however, may appeal his sentence.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Air carriers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk about their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will take place will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft at the descent of the aircraft before landing and do not speed them up until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, air carriers whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, said the FAA.
Most of the new line planes and other modified aircraft to enable passengers to use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiting, said she was happy about these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," explained Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "roomkeepers" when it comes to this question.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the CCF, that they could disrupt mobile telephony relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to discuss the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the high-tech gadget at that time.
New online aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Air carriers have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of on-line aircraft should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit far lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who pressure for a smoothing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders commissioned a Kindle electronic book reader line plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee of mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there is only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them meaningful arrangements for travellers equipped with technologies.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helitried after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil platform, was released into nature.
The water stream was mounted on board a helicopter heading towards Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
The exhausted bird appears to have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help."
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and to define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov questioned more than 1,000 business leaders, who are generally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on those countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to become involved in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcades.
When asked for their opinion on specific political issues – ranging from monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate compared to the benefits to be part of the European trade area – 40% of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European ones, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey with business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that gives back power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – achieving a change in the Treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow 16% of the votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for one moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate Britain's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is engaged in a closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, it means once again focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in the colours of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from Halloween's tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed chills to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the crossing of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the party caught up with them.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
Everyone is overexcited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.

Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Director of Gazprom said.
"A historic event took place today: Construction started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should allow Russia's export routes to Europe to be diversified.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is transited, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is launched in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bhutanese mutineers, an episode of the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly of the descendants of the Mutinés of Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
An Assistant to the Mayor of the Island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, who lives in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify those 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, neighbouring Pitcairn.
The FAA relies on restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but calls on mobile phones will always be prohibited.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former vice governor of Jilin Province in north-eastern China was sentenced to death imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million yuan of wine pots, reports the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and managers to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first middle court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tricks" as with the "mowers" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, including former Petrochina oil giant executives.
The most recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest positions in the state.
However, the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees at the YMCA in New South Wales were accused of sexual assault on children following allegations against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in his opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and one YMCA physical education monitor Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, a counsellor to the Commission, that he had known about the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by stressing, "External controls of YMCA have been carried out and have indicated that children's safety was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities held in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings to children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was framed by Lord and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she was responsible for child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have clouded their judgment, which means that they have not reported their actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views before the Council of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "reporting" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have confidentiality agreements signed to staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director General of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognized that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and his role as a special envoy of the Quartet for the peace process in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to Prime Minister's position, Mr Blair would have replied, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it might happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to fight and win the horse trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the little one and his ponie Shetland Toffee trout during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparables – of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap on his side in a casual way to make his 2-year-old Toffee pony parade around the track.
Fenton was hailed by judges for his unusual natural qualities of dress for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton has had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has been training since his Pony Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo."
They showed up against and against all, but both of them increased the golden cut and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded her."
He traveled all the length of the track running and even though he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will probably soon participate in the horse show of the year – and I'm sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and how they walked on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of himself.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be remodeled"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reissued, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to produce stories about a semi-public society.
The New Express is now going to undergo a "complete overhaul," the regulator said.
The order of "recast" comes from the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company named Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete re-engineering of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation of the responsible people at New Express and immediately re-engineer the newspaper management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted he had published false stories against money.
"In this case, I have disturbed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not correctly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear boilers, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed us "unavailability" of the ship until mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the DCNS company, a defense naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the malfunctioning boiler.
"Everything is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not call into question the ship's activity program" to nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier leaves an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had equipped from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is, in particular, to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small damage", surrounded by the space of containment of the reactor, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a deep dissatisfaction with the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken forcefully from taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no concern about sumptuous spending and maintenance of cattle ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to or demolished by the private company.
It is also regrettable to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I would like to make an honourable mention of the transformation of former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but rather in the private sector, based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that the lakes at Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large population decline, water use has declined considerably across the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never lack water and strict regulation about its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to accomplish great things with the money of others.
I should be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for most and I don't think a sheep breeder is making it worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzak over an equivalent length of nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which allows easy concealment of drug-related trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of sight, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with a sales intention.
They have been sentenced to life imprisonment for 10 years if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the Marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that need to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that departed from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be able to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated its appeal against its extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on June 19, calling for political asylum for that South American country.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to meet with a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange is afraid to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after revealing more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How biometry will invade our lives
Do you finish typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craving for biometry, but worry about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of hand or the venous network of hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and at any time," was Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in each other, and pessimism, in each other?
Biometry will be based on new techniques, which will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the hand contour, assume a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data to their own senses - and a drawback: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Consequently, research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computer computing capacity needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, it calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture R&D Laboratories in Europe.
With our assistance, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are doing research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," said Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible markers, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospectiveness at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase of €90,000 to analyse DNA samples at the place of crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometry are divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person among others) and authentication (make sure that the person is the person it claims to be).
The identification had so far concerned the issue of identity papers: we must compare the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) with the information that the state has on all already established citizens.
This makes it possible to ensure that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
"We recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who move freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, charged with commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a picture of someone who queues in a store, follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication was initially related to physical access (frontier, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the partner who points for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But more and more authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric player: this gesture replaces the secret code strike.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and major distributions: at the time of paying in store with its bank card, the client does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tracks to Secure Users
There are three ways to make biometry attractive to the general public.
The first one is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash thirty seconds less, it is appreciated," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, ensure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
However, due to a lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A 210 km/h driver with a hot drink between the legs was given a fine of £1,000.
A motorist was given a fine of £1,000 for running at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
At Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit led to a 6-month withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and an overtax for victims of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the measure of capital gains tax but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp right for properties of more than $2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The right to stamp already applies to residential properties of the arrondissements of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million over fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the right of stamp on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located south-west of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London show steady annual growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing internal market, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to the studies of Savills.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs were moving their tail further to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs were moving it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to tail movements disordered by other dogs, researchers followed animals watching films where other dogs were found.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes from one side to another.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films featuring other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factors – and we were able to betray the tail movement and present it as going more left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression move the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail turning mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience which movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and breeders to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, stated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in different studies did not fully consider animals of films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviours can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with its singer.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to take place on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to the Hydro de Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to happen in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20, and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will be held on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this is therefore a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony at which bishops will be raised to the dignity of Cardinal, known as a consistory.
"Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the consistory from February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholics said that by February, the number of cardinal voters would probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as he needed to reach 120 and as many cardinals as he wanted.
The next year's constitution will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis' election in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope had decided on his own.
"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "as far as possible" that Francis asked for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that François was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will appoint".
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the United States to fix the seat records
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a statement by the American vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could show a defect at the inclination mechanism level.
Consequently, records do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," said the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups started in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's share course rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama took place about 11 o'clock on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the roundabout of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all likelihood, work on the foundations has been carried out in this area for some time.
A mitoyen foundation wall had just been built over the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived on the site to recover her tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We saw only one part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a coffering company.
Revival maneuvers have been attempted by emergency services, but with no success.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Safety and Health Commission was dispatched to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He said Obama had made commendable efforts to overcome the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the slowness of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's about the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients at night and I lay down, this book brings me back to the time when the policies inspired millions of people and where the speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept every newspaper they found.
A young visionary team was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period prior to his appointment in 2008, he had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, by the end of the "no seen nor known" and the murder of Usama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American privacy, nor the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government's wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overrun of authorized expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are the "most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
And more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict previous political campaigns.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his application.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and poorly refined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index has dived under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton's benefit at the Primarys of Pennsylvania.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get on the right track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
This is five years later, Mr President, and I am no longer in agreement with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place on Retinne Street in Fleron.
The biker, 26-year-old Jonathan, from Fleron, didn't wear a helmet.
Despite rapid relief intervention, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining mining tycoon, which challenges the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument to try to rule out issues relating to a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially stated that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a restructuring of the suffrage removal system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, France and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it possible to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Today, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new "very serious" duties.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of stocked dolphin off the northern shores of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, who is responsible for the scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Milieux (OCEAM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Is the discovery of this new species of hard-bossed dolphin any wonder?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or membership of a species of a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged due to the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close species morphologically were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific-bossed dolphins and the Atlantic-bossed whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present here.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have dealt with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, the population of the new species discovered, its stock has automatically become lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
The marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene burning limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
It is better to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Marianne pit, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it's a long time since it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency market division from two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global regulators' investigation of the suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where $5.3 billion is changing hands each day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Interbank Libor rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted instant emails and messages, sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European accountkeeper for foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash trading manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that she had attempted action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma stated that she was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine the allegations made concerning bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News on these surveys has shaken traders in an area that has been one of the largest drivers of growth of investment banks' trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast exchange market strongly liquid, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have a low-cost impact on the market".
The news came on the same day as the Swiss Credit announced that it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it had caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation was terminated, supported by a lawyer
After police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby said they had never seen an investigation "so messed up".
Me Ruby said believe in La Presse Canadienne that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's casual friend and driver Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion over the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they had observed this man delivering packages at Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby has qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, claiming that Chief of Police Bill Blair chose to know why not act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also require an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as an "obvious and desperate attempt" to argue with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down to mid-term, with the exception of London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are decreasing Friday to mid-season, led by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
Furthermore, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse its policy of quantitative flexibility earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street are pre-empting an opening of US shares rising, after two consecutive replication sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest replica of ACC 40, led by the warning on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published results declining this morning and announced the creation of an internal bankruptcy structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) is still leading the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
In the exchange market, speculations on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy go well, as John Hardy has shown at Saxon Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the reduction of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to decline against the US currency and has hit a lower than two weeks to $1.3517 in session.
These same conjectures support the euro area's mandatory market on the other hand.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's health system reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the law of reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, judges have validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, on condition that they pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional under the government's tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the health system reform law, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered in order to lose all federal funding of the program, was binding in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in high school during the 2012 primarys, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, strongly opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to Veterans Veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Acrochment between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, 31 October 2013, at night during a violent hanging on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stocks were exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell shot during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a monitoring operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 metres into the territory before withdrawing thereafter.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a press release, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defense of the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"The Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell of an occupant," threatened the spokesperson.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said army spokesperson Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in north-west Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite chain.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he just added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombardment targeted a shipment of ground-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base at Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Dance Dance his two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, progresses, of profile, fine as a line and clothed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple features, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: an array of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully clothed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate, emerge in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in unison group (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Morning Glory", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
Energy is high, rhythm is always fast.
There will be cracks when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a portion of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotone in the scream, and continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up sweating and swallowing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard's - such as those hair that get boisterous or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the chorégraphic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, imposed himself, with his tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michalus, like forms of Gestalt, open a wider and gibocious imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hit by a stroboscope light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches the magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the internship, are richer.
The scene is partly gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers were relaying to play the scores.
Their rude, touching music gives real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duo, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with the red nose, in very polarized romantic male-female parades.
Loves are butchers, fugitives or players.
The gesture, laughter and small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the room takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotin dancers, descend among the spectators, glow, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a well-calculated disorder that remains sensual.
The joy and madness sweat, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings concerning Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nordal patents has started an avalanche of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he co-signed to the pole when selling to patent auctions that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the North patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent-infringing companies before the United States Court of Assis in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that enable advertising to be displayed in relation to search terms on the Internet, indicated the findings of the trial, which is Google's core trade.
It was not possible to contact representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which gives fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering 4.4 Md$.
After losing the Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 Md$, a partial market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it has violated and continued to violate those patents," the court's findings indicated.
Rockstar claims more damages and interests against Google, because he claims that Google's patent violation is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater at the origin of the explosion
Grandma would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a faulty water heater, indicated Friday night the replacement of the King's Attorney.
The expert posted on-site by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
Grandma lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life-threatening forecast of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was heavily burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to Liège's CHU, she was in a helicopter, she was in an ambulance," said Miss José Paulet, who came down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairway remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were rejoined by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnea has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected President to swear
Mohamed Morsi lent the investment oath, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the oath of investment to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to clarify the new president and, taking into account the presidential façade of the Mubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the little charismatic "help wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to appear not only as the candidate of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun at the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room adorned with woodwork where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was in custody.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand...", which was introduced by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and the former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended Mobarak's authoritarian regime came to an end last year, and vowed to regain the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former out president, possessed him.
But by agreeing to formally give an oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the USA has curbed the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published Friday by manufacturers, five of the six main performances below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualised and seasonally adjusted rhythm sales, but the market was 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst by Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he felt that this slight brake was first explained by the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first 15 months."
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared with 211 563 expected by consensus.

Renault led in Stock Exchange by Nissan's Warning
Renault accuses Friday the highest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had decreased by almost 20% its annual net profit forecast, reported traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a revision, also announced a renewal of his leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected by "warning" this morning.
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said one manager of the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese builder 15% of French, according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was severely injured Friday night by fires fired by two people on board a motorcycle that passed by a location of the Golden Aube neo-Nazi party in the west suburb of Athens, learned from police sources.
The police were not in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Aube doré had claimed that the victims were guardians of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the counter-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of New York, where the incident took place and closed the area.
The incident took place a few weeks after the indictment of six Members of Aube dorée, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for having hit Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club called himself "very disappointed", thinking that his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity across the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The areas most affected are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in black, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also has its lot of pans with almost 7,000 private homes of electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had begun in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are well on track to achieve record results throughout the year before interest and tax deduction," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector has increased during the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate for a domestic market for small-scale business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Her subsidiary in the United States recovered her losses during the first half of the year where the seasonal demand is lower and was expected to benefit from the overall exercise for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown ones pull over a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Caught unknown opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making any victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with fired employees.
Assailants fled, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif, said.
This attack then occurs when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A combined English language and literature course will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
On the other hand, Ofqual, the Regulatory Examinations Bureau, will reveal a restructuring of the structure of the CCSEs, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was a "wide consensus as to the need to reform our system of reviews to restore public confidence," stressing that the CSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time in maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore make an average of 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GSCE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance attached to the materials in international classifications – would probably encourage schools to provide more hours of course.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and which is widely called into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An eight-year-old welcomes children with a gun at the Muy for Halloween
The minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the banks of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his mark, was in fact buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily high-pressure based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the post-War.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"As of August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
"In the left inner pocket were his service conditions with a picture," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormous taste of bad.
"The memory of the victims is greatly crowded," he insurmounted himself in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is among the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, in particular, under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to choose the "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the sequelae the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to obtain any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," says Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock, yell at the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are incurred in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and all his fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they start in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrains to get to the villages that need help most.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, singing and dancing and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and overwhelming energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive beckons, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, a mayor or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exciting rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night long to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," explained Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a second year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr.Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn in the field they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help drain the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwell," explained Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have a chance to do in America when you're a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there is no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do that.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Surprised, the academics have long painted and located Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but by highlighting its weak for the paths of crossing, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of others' works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred thing cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the the thesis, of which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and a federation of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
In this uncertain image the monument of the "Memorial Place", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Bad languages were able to see there a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp glance and eruditional but incurablely amateur.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed by for not writing had a lot and well written.
The book here should ultimately render justice to him.
However, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual hoaxing, the retirement that is set to leap as one's feet from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book to such a beautiful title bring the striker to a single passion: that of discovering the core of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a matter of time.
Soon, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliged, was entrusted to authorized prefects and subprefects, interpreters.
What Pierre Nora does is everything else.
He does not inherit eternal France, he refuses to define it.
Concerned analyst for a strange family, he wanders into a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of rebuses, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so sustainablely settled in its borders, if it was formerly charpent and solidly masonate, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are just as pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that splits into two national stories.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but not to deny it; rather concerned to regain its sacrality and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head to the one who was the evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, shared between left and right, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this unique French identity feel nothing worth the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American co-ordination only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men covered by an Old Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when she here sowed the drama and confirmed it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are worth making, and who have been among themselves.
There is an institutional constancy, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as many errors to catch and tests to resume.
France leaving, France coming
However, there was a time when the French thought they could wear the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of number two.
In this IIIrd Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, by teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France was darkly preparing for modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only took some time.
Here again in debate, surrounded by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of claimed minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises.
It was discovered that the fireplace was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The smoother was held at the centre of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, this is more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had abstained from the initial exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have done it.
Of course in a less rigid, brighter and more subtle form.
But let's not be mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Taken to Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team filming a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released about 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation of the "Otage of the World" hostage defence association, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to lodge complaints and bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families since.
And try gradually to resume their course of life.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the "Otage of the World" association.
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h board of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, in particular, Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the safe of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're depositing us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive on the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French take us to the French Embassy.
It's the time of the first blow to the parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirts at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate ourselves to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Upon arrival on the helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on French soil take place?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the aircraft staircase, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The biker pulls his ass to take pictures and follows me to my place where I have to do a little police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop. We're good to know.
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But we've made it tougher.
I'll be at 8:00 the next day. I'll be on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for one or two months that are a little like vacation.
How did medical examinations and Debriefing DGSE happen?
I was entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the following days: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage takers.
That was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's said.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to do the part of the questions about my past as a hostage and my "Otage of the World" association's chair that allows me to get away, and it seems much more interesting to me to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify the taking of hostages from "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to lodge complaints and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why don't we say to hostage-takers "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
However, it seems to me to be grounded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but it doesn't listen, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger rages in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
It is not a trial that underlines this militant of the Muslim Brothers.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial instigated a pro-Morsi, he's supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel reproaches 9 American States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and to the benefits that come with them," the Minister in New York recalled in an address before the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard," he denounced, accusing them of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these maps, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access to their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The leaf of the nine states began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implantations of the Texan National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texan Law and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration is taken on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m. before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the award at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young Hieroian prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he does not like anything as much as showing up to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Ask Him About a Drug Case · Global Voices
In Canada, Toronto's mayor is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media outlets.
A video sent to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested man, Rob Ford, always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property to interrogate him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological survey has been undertaken to identify and assist people who could have contacted this kitten between October 8 and October 28, including," the Ministries of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the symptoms appear, is very effective," says the communiqué.
The ministries now call on people who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin injured by that kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"As France has been free from rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, without compensation," says the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "aboriginal" case of rabies dates back to December 1998 and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE).
An angry case on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the ministries recall and it is transmitted for almost 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama goes back to his reform of the health system
In an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of termination from their claimants, the Republicans criticized the president over the last few days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" about terminations, President Obama encouraged Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You will win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the self-insurance population were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "sadly."
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who pronounced this sentence, while she believed her microcute, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Mrs.Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel features a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected, Jake Vite Prekop, has combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the track.
The German Sebastian Vettel, quadrupled champion of Formula 1 world, has expanded for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose out of 1,500 drawings sent around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, his stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet for the race on Sunday to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban Party
Let's not be wrong, especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieu" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies it.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent, its project, presented Thursday at a press conference in its native town of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural mixing pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal No 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorially attached, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I advocate in my programme are attached to the left, but if the people on the right are ready to support me, I will listen to them, too, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme - consultable on the Internet - from many themes that are supposed to speak to people living in the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the office as a custodian of real estate...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, this may be fair, he acknowledges."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have received since yesterday don't all emanate from suburbs" he is delighted.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry pointed out that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programs had been reduced by admitting, on several occasions, that spying "was too far off inappropriately".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by denounced Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came up.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then on September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage had passed the borders, but he insisted that the rights of each had not been violated.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged U.S. case of espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had expressed himself before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had voiced concerning a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration that comes from monitoring the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in their mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and president of the Sub-Commission on European Affairs of the American Senate, during an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, but the Agency's director said this week was inaccurate and that this was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents issued by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and those from 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affective firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been applying themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to visit this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by the bad results of Shell and after an announcement by the Fed of maintaining its state support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian appeals for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for allegedly being assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on June 15, of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her earlier on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after she separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the history of all parts.
She was detained in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
He is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of rugby Peter Tunks, who called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously experienced a stressful moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed to the court and was released after the payment of a security of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an abated sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's Phuket, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will stop Anderlecht supporters coming other than with the RSCA cars
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, announced Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson of the Brussels-middle police area, Friday.
The Belgian carriers of the RSCA who will want to visit this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesperson transmitted.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture reported that measures have been taken to make arrests or even guards in sight," announced Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This has motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to think about how to better integrate students who live on horseback among different cultures.
The school board has just revealed its vision of "Living together in French".
The Organization Vision Diversity has been in schools for a year to help students from all backgrounds to discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of strain or have come.
Who are our builders?
"Therefore, projects are created to identify themselves with all this," explains vision diversity president Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the New World Institute, has identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we see within the student clientele," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who also sometimes come from.
Rachida Azdouz of the University of Montreal will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: language, school, social and cultural.
