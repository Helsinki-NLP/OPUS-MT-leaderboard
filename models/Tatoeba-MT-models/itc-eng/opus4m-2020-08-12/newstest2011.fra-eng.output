What's going to happen? CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital city hall will seem to have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in recent years at the mayor's office, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream started in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the new elect did not understand the well-known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a jeunôt in pragois politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to the culture to test the vocabulary of the "parent".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elect Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf crossing".
"It's the only expression you're proposing me to use"
Otherwise, I don't use the bow.
Of the vocabulary, including the daily Akualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year prior to the pre-ectoral congress of the ODS, the writing chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the bakery, "beef nerf", "capital betrayal" and "enter".
Three of the elected members agreed for the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who has to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then didn't pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has basically refused the test.
"I do not care about all these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy are amused: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not seem to recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-Mary Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he came up with in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said and immediately added, "but I know about the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," funny him.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, they know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of going to the bakery.
"It's about, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's about the headquarters of the companies in Janousek.
On the same subject, your Brezina recalls that he learns his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of argot in social democracy.
"I've been consulting with colleagues and it turns out that we don't really have anything like that."
"The names are said to be sometimes used with abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democrat Party, who members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called to Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like that," Karel Brezina said about nicknames.
Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The Weinert election is Papy for the party members or the least friendly Old Petit, the Miroslav Pouche representative, who drew attention to him before the election by the scams during the party's sponsorship, is called "the little joujo".
Nicknames are also the only ones who admit to using social democrats within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragmatic president.
"Doctor in matraque law" recalls that Petr Hulinsky won his title as a doctor in law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "flies", it has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sorry" is isolated to avoid threatening the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We don't judge healthy young women either because they participate in work and give birth to children," said a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who were rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit hunting to witches.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the daily Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil they had sprinkled.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
Criminals claim it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used in ritual anointings has been ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil ignited, it seemed, when the team wanted to "put out the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorts" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Human-spirited eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia did not later than last year even see the President himself taking part.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for witches who, it seemed, would have participated in his death and would have struggled by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Français from Guinea came to rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and personal custody of the President, men and women randomly selected in the villages of Gambia," the organization "Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, imprisoned persons were to drink a plant potion based on hallucinogenic effects, which also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released on international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The heated polies, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out of the door of the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "coal bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is trying to serve a penalty.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the wire will have to settle from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 kroner.
"And there is no hot water and heating works with solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the signature power.
"But I signed anyway," he explains in anger and half-resigned.
The Citizens' Association of BytyOKD.cz Apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says another thing" by rubbing his eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what is expected of most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Akualne.cz has for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, rent 2011, is on touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts lighting up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - requesting repairs, insurance and other events.
In the Ostrava region, people with more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio receive mail with new lease contracts in their letterboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special shop for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for about a week, so it's still being tested" responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originating in the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of Social Democrats has reported it quite sustainably before the elections and now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a put...no board in the toilets, relief in introduction the man mentioned.
However, according to employees, pensioners come to be sure that they will receive a refund on the new rental price if they sign now as RPG promised in a special offer.
This is a drawback of half of the rent that will be received by other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee said at the window.
And yet RPG places both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, the decision will be made by an independent court.
'It is not about threats but only about informing about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally', says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the client centre is right.
"I have 13,000 retiring crowns and I have 5000 left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she says.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the company's GDP Byty residential portfolio, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 GDP was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the cushioned chairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments".
"And it will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech kroner at m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase of rents (see graph) is given to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lease increase agreement have priority.
Mother's school is also part of the offices that have included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also houses a mini motherhood school with all the necessary - colour walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The architectonic project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal school of business since the first drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of children, and it was important for women architects and project leaders to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this mother's school and with the support of management that they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
With funding facilities (up to 2.8 thousand Czech crowns) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) Arch. Design. company has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-maternal school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and mother's teacher take care of children. Children can go to mother's school without age limitation but they are more than three years old for most.
As it is a "mini maternal school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more to replace.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini-maternal school program is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not just play it, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to the preparation of schools, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their children at any time and not have the stress of a delay to go to a remote school from the parent's workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The house still fascinates after 100 years. Look into Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric sarian, the staircase with a dinosaur spine and the balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname of House in bone from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of tiles and mosaics, façade recalling scales and everywhere present of curves, here is all that is ypic for Art Nouveau d'Antoni Gaudi.
The front of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colours and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, you can see geometry, rhythm and order that are precisely thought.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
Rolling and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
Wood copies window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the blades.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district on the March Street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of old construction and the construction of another all new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual reconstruction and better market.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a house with multiple homes was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol was working with him.
It is precisely on his project that decorations were born for an apartment representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators have also worked for the facade.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after it was finished due to its organic forms "the House in Bone".
Others, in view of the specific opening mechanism of the windows called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely failed to comply with the construction directives and did not allow themselves to be hampered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded changes.
He did not, for example, like members of the municipal council that construction pillars were impeding on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from Josep Battlo demanded (and got satisfaction) the permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common lounge and on the third there was a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a lucrative company and they expanded the field of visits to common spaces and barns, including roof terraces.
The ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist maps have 20 percent discount.
The amount is still above the entry price in other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summary: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so mattresses and summits provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status, and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the top is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously slept are not appropriate because they are "heating" slowly.
Moreover, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. The mold can also form.
The habit is also decisive in choice.
The person who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a soft layer will feel hard on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all hockey people who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their weary shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a lattice layer of lazy foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore take the wrong "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in the stuffed furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy mousse conquered hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy to be able to appreciate a lazy mousse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't go back in the night as after a hard game.
You're just sleeping better.
The lazy mousse also works as a protection against the quadrants.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm altogether.
For single beds, for example, single beds, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Mathelassiers and Decorators who has spent many years on the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs his own top and mattresses, so pay attention however when choosing the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only be able to climb the top at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"To touch or sit on the mattress you should not feel the springs," says Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of summation.
The bedroom, when the mattress and the top are united like Siemese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we must not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l, it's clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a large (and closed) stale.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or life warranty.
But everything to his mother.
And for that, an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to the hygiene or to the washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with slide closures for the whole, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a sink?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the plane (if there is no) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of such a bed.
For single-position lump summaries with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconuts), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the bottom of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions, it is not necessary to take mattresses with springs because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the rigidity adjustment of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special link of the blades that allows you to push or even tilt the blade to make the sleeping arm "integrate" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as back", it's really important.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for "male" began to use a shoulder rolling area.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hip level.
For the most difficult customer there are wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure spreads to more points and diinues tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and summaries, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple ear: the ear must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the earring must be raised (with the shoulder cradle of the top or the area toss in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw and grass base.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
"The Bio Qualitative for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender perfumes.
There are differences between man and woman.
While extracting from bubble plants so the coating of the mattress absorbs the heat and cools the body, "cool" the man, the coatings "heating" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cell structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of the cold mosses gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, back bottom and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less than VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached first place.
Saving for mattresses and top is not simple.
From time to time, we may have in special actions by manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Like the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam memory sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second one for free.
The era of the lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempor material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were going to start huge load factors.
The Tempor is soaking in heat and hardening, on the contrary, cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes an optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this to fight bad sleep and to increase comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and vein system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
The devices to track people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child is making people more and more think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even though the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of bad use of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his view, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if the child doesn't want to bring something like this to him, he'll get rid of it.
'And even smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control.'
"Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
"If it's a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything he can to keep the child from having an electronic device to locate him."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as trace devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
It also confesses that such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, he claims that having such a device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on regular emission after a specified period."
"In case the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in an extended position without moving', says Cech.
According to him, smartphones called intelligent phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after they have formed it with a special proficiency.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the one that is being worn in pendant of the size of a lightbox or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll figure it out after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for drawing cars.
This is a combination of systems for acquiring a position using GPS (which is commonly used as a self-sustainment) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could turn the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army purchased 445 km of strings used for explosives.
As of last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km of it.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the strings is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating strings at the company anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the award of a huge amount of detonating strings to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has contacted, it should be noted that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vladimil Pick, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the 60 km army of detonating strings.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that was true, the military reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to provide more than 2 m of detonating strings, as the experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that the shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body clothes we don't talk about.
"And I don't take my head if they buy us such a lot of detonating strings."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive as traders to content," says STV Group Jan Decky's business director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating ropes will be paid by the army to have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reported only four years of life of detonating ropes and police and army pyrotechnics only two years old.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it can even go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in view of the army's criticism.
Each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains an integral part of the life of the soldier and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating strings.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 245 km," said Spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating chains of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always command only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be more flexible in obtaining more modern and more reliable detonating string types.
today, the Ministry of Defence has major problems in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army was preparing to move, heading towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonating strings that it buys today "at cheap".
So far, I take advantage of contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the best individual entrepreneur competition.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun likes to travel.
And abroad, it was found that in Liberia there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments to half-demolition.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region gave me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his work as a contractor has allowed him to open 4 pensions in Libérec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was up to recently the four Pytloun stars hotel design.
This year he was given another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates showed up", number 1 of the entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory at the contest of the entrepreneur of the year served well," said Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and being known to Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses until today his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the reputation of success also impacted employees.
And he's about 70.
"I observe in them especially the loyalty and pride of engaging in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Signature of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight competition', said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic bathers.
Not long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
He became the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after successful competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they were working with a society that had the greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year didn't go to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their auctions of new materials and technologies.
"We have of course not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fire," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that unpopular measures are needed from time to time.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the staff, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibition fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything lets us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of affidavits is higher than the number of employees with them.
"In the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates foolish regulations.
The survey on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year's Absurdity Survey was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor could obtain it in two clicks of mouse.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the Trade Register for Insurance Payment Controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske nounny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters showed up, at least 4,000 votes were made this year.
And it's not surprising, in our country there are the most diverse legal obligations that just slow down the company, and, that, more and more.
"Perhaps we are in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal for all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place in terms of the company's conditions, i.e. 8 more places than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first established in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can report annual administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, last time before the closing of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees there is, for example, the obligation that motor vehicles for the maintenance of motorways and rapid routes pay tolls, or even entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always starts in early November on the Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public life figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts horns in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to delete at least three dozen paragraphs each year that today only complicate the company', said Martin Kocoreek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to eliminate absurd declines is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the employer's obligation to report three days before the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most plebiscite obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has existed for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Signature.
The objective of this competition is to support the fair and reasonable enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the company's 2010 competition, organized by the company Vodaphone, companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different, one may consider their support and forecasting activity as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is no example of the Prague and Netera proficiency company that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund sponsoring children with disabilities for 17 years.
In caring for employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent, has been awarded the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohème region and has moved third in the region to the competition of the Vodaphone Sign of the Year.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, decreasing wages.
The jury also awarded it the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports an activity in the surrounding environment and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Logit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has established them for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the society.
At the latest, for its activities, there is also a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of a bonus above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravie-Sylesia region.
They were automatically enrolled in the responsible corporate category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone year's competition, who had responded to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and sent it to the organizer before August 15.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Signature of the year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Sign of the Year," says Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organizing agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public contest
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have been making arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and trading in real estate Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to handle precisely a call for public tenders for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a determined candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for initiation in connection with a call for tenders and a public contest." said Pravo, the chief of Plzen Antonie Zelena's Public Prosecutor, knowing that more explanations are forbidden because the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that the police had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace, and that was during the public competition.
"He was a client and in no case an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for land transfer under the Land Act" and is set up when several legal candidates show up.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to receptacles which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the acquirers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had applied for the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had offered candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably in the process of withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He was in the case of the former chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be constructed.
Later he exchanged it with the mayorate for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor's office was obliged to accept because otherwise it could put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 krona monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
The families will therefore have to remove from their wallet from January up to a hundred monthly crowns more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas is almost 2 per cent cheaper, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be around 100 kroners annually for households in the apartment than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the development that is sensitive to encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
So we can also count an additional 100 crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
They are mainly the largest municipalities planning the increase in prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more than a month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the pragois they will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4%.
The prices of rents will, for example, increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children are bubbling in rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are not yet fifteen years old in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from hospitals' children departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be a saucer."
'The trend is really strong,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemian.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of papa into the cupboard, it's sometimes whiskey, but it's the fernat and vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today is fashionable alcohol especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he acted as a Slavic who brought them home," said Jurinova.
According to the head of the Pelikan department, seeing drunk children aged between thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice last year, he was in Motol, where he had worked for ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought students from large areas completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She began her twelve-year-old career when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with plus a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their tolerance out of the common because their rejections are due to the drinking that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"It's the alcoholic word that means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it, but that we don't find it in children."
"For those who use repetitive acool, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," explained the Chief of the Department of Pelikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
They are only integrated into statistics with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization.
Drinking children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, it existes according to Pelikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, St. Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
" Either they drink despite bad results or instead they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I lived on the day of witches a single admission of 7 drunk children," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the day after the "wood mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients needed by the body.
"They are better lotis for this because they spend an excellent evening then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They're only surprised at where they are," says Pelikan knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drinking cost and that they could spend the entire summer at seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pelikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover parental care-related burdens, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in all, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone else than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration thefts.
These are the two-place versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech army and were in a state of flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
For the time being, they are located at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - has taken them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is for the moment unknown.
'The L-159 single-seaters planned for the exchange have been taken on long-stocked aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two places L-159 T1 have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He argued that the army would not be without a biplace since the department signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four L-159 monoplaces used in two.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one who takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the person considering how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noun announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa plane and the purchase of three more planes for 3.5 billion kroner was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and has contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only 24 of them wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with longer index than the annull are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years of age," proclaimed the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer test, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the annullary.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those with the longest index the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60, the risk decrease reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers quoted - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of compact snow, the miners worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 auro in Brno towards Prague is the same fate.
The Central Car Club Dispatcher (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st km a truck was injured, at the 93th two heavy weights struck, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the intersection.
The problems are also on the highway D1 to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th km or go to Brno and then enter the 182nd km to Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometres has formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, that, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, rows of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams take a delay, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the state of Prague's crisis must meet again.
Railways and airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to delete due to the rapid snow of 7 connections.
Lines like Prague in Kralupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling with vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road to Brno there are beginning to be by snowflakes and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass some channels of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region has been one of the most affected areas.
To date the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowshoes and strawberries.
We can't estimate when they'll be rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is strict in the white Carpathians region.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warning CTK.
In Chechnya, it fell between two and ten centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemian, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in Czechia.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its shells are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive actually works as small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at the target's contact but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
Neither is it protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it mainly in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a specific target point, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."

400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their place of work that is currently located in the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates his branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, so far located on the Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs that have yet to be found in the region.
The offer of rental was extremely attractive. Also, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a large company within the region has caused yesterday the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the city of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith related to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding only one place so exceptional that it remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building at Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical" company, as well as the rest of the buildings at Place Marienbad, was part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the city hotel. It provoked many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the surfaces that used to be used in parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company rating and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Immobilien-Chancen specialized Frankfurt purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. One year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group, based in Tokyo, considers itself the world's third largest IT supplier.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu has certainly more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This old 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among others the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its host server until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator, Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, probably stayed in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", indicated on Wednesday (local time) cyber activists at the origin of revelations via the Twitter social network.
Recently, the cyber-business, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation of Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would take this action earlier on previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the honourable senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, and in doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world," said an independent senator.
"No company that is aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks' spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were reported against the site.
"Calls have even been issued for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief of Government Counsel Mr. stephen Harper stated ironically on television that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre for Counter-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for combating escapes.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also intends to verify the ways in which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day launch course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German, the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula and then starts selling it.
To find out, we do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbets founded the ice university in 2003 to ensure that the ice creams released from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day launch course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Also, practical sessions are held in private glaciers.
In the middle of the 40th crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others just risk realizing their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a quality European product in the future in the country of the Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management advisor and, after a few years, she wants to take a few unique things out of this challenging profession for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children loved Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is crucial not only good taste, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees with an electronic program, and immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out a pasteurized base white cream, based on all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately called into question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizers?
How can we give free courses to personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who only speak of "made from natural ingredients" ice may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is of course possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will crack nothing but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is dust and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to reenact you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Be in the fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in the ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when added with cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and nuts with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily have the taste of the walnut, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice is manufactured from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
Ice manufacturing is a calculation exercise: if you use peach powder with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the vine growers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as it once did.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it occuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, small tires are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is bartering with fruit purée from his head to his feet and thus slapping his fellow students when the control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that such an "accident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that has experienced the cultivation of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," he said on Wednesday in Munich, Director of Testbiotech, Christoph Then.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked decisively to develop the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond to the position taken by the Ilysi pressure group by paragraph and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking head of the Ephesus recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or without transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused both the suspicions of the German Federal Environment Agency and European MEPs.
However, Efsa does not admit that there is any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he was working for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi).
This body is considered to be a neutral forum involving experts from, among other things, science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the impact of genetically modified maize causes on the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which do not allow reliable results.
"If you're not looking for risks, how can you find them?" asked Mr. Then about your accuser.
That is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region and in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers that are not related to societies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The stone trace
Uli Gsell has searched for it, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon she was standing in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was some noise.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against project S21, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was ruined when demonstrations resulted in the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He's been looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that when he cut it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with that fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former deposit of French army ammunition in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken or disappeared into the dump," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He said that he was subjected to insults and threats when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of project S21.
And he explained to them that there was nothing he could do at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallepipes weighing on average 80 kilograms, of which the value is between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a reminder in everything, hoping they can also make it during reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still packed into the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscaped gardens, Particuliers.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could into the safe and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass-bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"in the summer this political component."
He enters his car all over land, turns his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did law studies that he had abandoned. Later, he began studying biology before he became interested in computer science and finally became a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40000 tonnes.
He's hoarding treasure all over Germany.
HE asserts that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's talking about it.
Stones of sand carved with art are placed on the snow.
"They used to be part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, asserts with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
He showed a lot of his finger: Red sandstone, before, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Good travertin."
The parallelepipe was once part of the Neckarstadion rostrum of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the cathedral of St. Blasien, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what a effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that once the stones were hand carved and moved using simple palanes and carts drawn from cattle, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He didn't become rich, even less demanding.
But today this career employs 14 people. Moreover, stone carpenters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycling company.
Right away, he has to go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
talent struggle to conquer the high potential
The counter has a strong flow.
16 students are pumping to buy small salmon bread, tomato sauce and white-foods.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of some sort of contest of ideas, they need to talk business about the future car with VW designers, and, in turn, meet the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to detect better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most skilled graduates in amphitheatres as far as possible before they arrive on the job market and are not brokered by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performances, they try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to be loyal to them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the car group loves talent.
A young lady of the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards that include the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's premises.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know students, look more closely at serious candidates and appreciate those who are on the line as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's happening again is the offensive with which we try to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was rather on the professional project," says Mr.Selle.
The struggle to win the new graduates will become much worse.
In sector assets, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a kyrill of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all shorten the highly qualified workforce.
Above all, they are the graduates from the engineering industries who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will expand further.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and counseling.
It organizes costly events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of rally-paper where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they can travel through the United States.
Participants can visit KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The participant decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the resources used for the search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all the people who took part last year in similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he said.
Apart from the direct softening carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises work in a very classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they hunt brains.
"We're trying to reach graduates by participating in professional trade fairs."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Fair," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company installed in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the problem of resurgence.
Currently, 35 posts are posted on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant posts."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with different higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or to write his project of completion at our home."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to make its advertising by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group can't do that," said Stübe, chief of staff.
There has been a long time since money no longer played the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies 55th of Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual board of honour of German employers.
To this end, he asked employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at employees' framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hoped that this placement would enhance the company's image with job seekers.
"I think candidates are referring mainly to external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image in its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When dealing well with employees and identifying with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Southeastern United States, over the coming years.
The Government of Washington has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus has finally annulled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new boreholes remain banned for the time being.
Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform, which is at the root of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this one-time accident that cost the lives of eleven employees and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not so far resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims for compensation of several billion, is at the heart of the charges.
A commission of inquiry established by Obama must present its findings in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the ice of the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited following numerous allegations of corruption, is currently being thoroughly reformed.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector of activity are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The Government's objective is to halt the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, prior to the ban on drilling delivered on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new levels at the expense of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a similar smell to that in the gas station: Because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil destroyed Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't wear out," the environmental activist throws the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man lying in the muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat sleigh surrounding him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It can't be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil swabs.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom relates that she used to collect shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil flowed from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen live in the small town near Bodo now have to be reduced for six hours to reach the fishing waters: Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the ravages jumps to the eyes as mangrove marshes crossed through watercourses.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat splits a brown crading water. Anyone who dives his hand takes it out completely covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like batons of reglish. Isolated palm trees sadden their palms.
Birds' nudes are sought in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As long as the off-board engine stops, a phantom silence falls on this paradise of times which resembles a service station by the smell it unleashes.
"What happens here is war on the environment," said Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where Ogoni lives is a battleground besieged for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was carried out later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni is still forbidden to this company: while more than 2 million barrels of black gold are daily pumped with more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines across the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni are not exploited, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters stand in the water of the steel truces as strange sculptures: Very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees" the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are run by corrosion up to the benchmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion litres have been poured over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that in the sea during the accident of the superoiler "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who must bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution?The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists consider drilling head explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conduct failures is "even higher than alleviation".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with cambouces up to the neck.
A spark fire under one of the many tons that are sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
We have crude oil heated in the ton for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline penetrates into a container through pipes, then at the end of the conduction of kerosene droplets fall and finally obtained diesel.
So Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre Diesel barrels daily: "This reports 34,000 Naira," about $22.
Delta residents benefited from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the pipeline network in perce throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small small part of the provisionally stored raw material is unlawfully purified: organized crime networks that also count among its members of politicians and high-ranking soldiers, charge the lion's share in tankers and graze it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of laxist production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of withdrawing the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to unravel" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at all they will offer them pots of wine.
Even mostly soldiers from the north of the country want to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
"From a point of view, this piece of shit has dropped our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company were visibly more likely: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft were having a serious safety problem, and it warned against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the oil pipeline connection level, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
She could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
The reactors produced by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft from the A380 series are concerned.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4, Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in respect of the incident in early November.
Parts moved apart and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced around the world.
Australian investigators announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, the spokesperson of ASTB, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the Quantas airline had immobilized his entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa replaced, by a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest line aircraft in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany grow: By cold temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to reach the end of the snow that was constantly piled up.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the shoreline of the Schleswig-Holstein Baltic Coast will be held with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowmas on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather alert plant Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt Land, the police authorities announced serious road disruptions.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls hit motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, falling trees on railways, Catenary or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop his trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply 165 train passengers with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in many flight cancellations in Germany's major airports.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Port spokesman indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer numerous, despite the fact that only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train on a level pass.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car drove a ton on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will turbillonn in the case of light gusts.
But the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin tours.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to reports from newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could account for up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
The financial group now clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as written by the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the intended sale.
He said, "We'll check whether it's more interesting to take care of the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back into rental later."
Thus, Germany's largest financial institution has already divested its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from own funds holders, and then re-assigned them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have included, according to some indications, around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Tours", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry to the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the underage minors who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to reassemble the bodies because the security situation of the sinister well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team could descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors were no longer able to survive.
Until now, the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun bursting in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 underage minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfing boards, also had their place.
The flags were put in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative festival that New Zealand had nurtured the hope that minors would go back to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial celebration.
South African and British minors were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to put out a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the movie Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
Which audience could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) having only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his burrow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, just because our hero uses methods of brutal murder. When he is in bad mood, he removes the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the border said no words on its real name. Even the other characters let escape at least one or two sentences a few shrieks of appalling agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and we feast in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it is harmful that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy of the drug traffickers, full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and testing cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
Lovers of action films die from boredom, when the border departs, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no movie distributor in Germany and that there is only DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of poverty that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a film that strikes, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lugurious soundtrack, but especially with an insatissible hatred that flows from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who loyally stands by the edge, preserves some innocence, all the others are excited by anger.
More than anything else, the bourgeois hero whose furniture is never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by becoming a warrior, is perhaps sending the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims to bore the frustration, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious Earthquake Work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 km: it is Dair as-South.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it is about the reactor that Syria has built seems to have been built with the help of North Korea in stone parallellepipe, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the plant which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, more information is available than at the time, and even with time, the mystery is becoming increasingly heavy.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weaponry program".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "appropriate".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how he made sure he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer saying that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hastily removed the ruins of the "unutilized military building" and carried out a methodical flattening of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers from one Member State showing the moment that the attack was directly followed. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that uranium found on the site comes from Israel's weapons.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analysis of particles by calling it intrusive.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion on this matter, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuse access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this case has been delayed since June 2008 without a result and it "has become increasingly a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat in service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are here for, or what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also as neighbouring cities.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is stated that the Syrians fear that the inspection group will actually be spies sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by American secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallepipe in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used for fuel production".
It would have "no indications concerning sensitive activities", such as enrichment and recovery of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
Whether the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in all three sites, is unknown.
When hundreds of trucks charged with land have disappeared, no one will have information on the storage site of the engravings.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998 only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken terrasing work on the three suspicious sites and moved large containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to dispel suspicions.
In the diplomatic arenas, it is said that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan on inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time spent shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, Glyn Davies, for example, said the US ambassador who has been referring to special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open to the future," but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation rise.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to: "It would be useful if they did not find anything at all."
Love in Wartime
It's wrong since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian burreau during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Federations of Bosnian Women protested immediately. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasicic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie herself is a good-will ambassador to UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she has already proposed that these women have a meeting with them in Hungary, but these women have declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says enough about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner that he withdraw his capacity as a good-willed ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted a shooting permit to Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself ensures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that she has made a great deal of effort to learn about the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other long before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is amorphous from her burrow".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie expresses herself, is "unjust and based on incorrect information".
Now only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as well as many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, everything's fine again with the Irish.
no trace of consternation.
That is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy at the bottom of strong music, they trample their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and succeed in dropping table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer goblets from the opposing team.
This strange show is called "beer-pong". The winner carries 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to the World Championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cyan Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the computerist reserved, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the lukewarm question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she took off her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes full place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects well-trained young Irish people who have only experienced moments of happiness so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, however, three in ten persons under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper has published widely the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave extinguishes the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a darker future because the government only throws dust in the eyes and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cramp from a practical internship not paid to another.
She states that it is her greatest concern to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to positively address this theme.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the levels of the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gale, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just came out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost no longer."
He burst out of a messy laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-suited front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"They were times of madness, no doubt money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, reserts hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn't like the regrets he's often heard in recent times.
"No one has to suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad is not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns you well in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell night.
"Only not much emotion," he said, drinking a long beer throat.
"Good-bye, it seems still worrying."
"Let's rather call it a good-bye evening, all relaxed, gathering some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerged from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the quite sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, thus reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; it was the same as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a strong increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook the support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly because many countries in America have experienced only a brief recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased only slightly in 2009 and again decreased to 32 per cent this year.)
But mood varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see table 5).
About 31% say that they themselves or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure has fallen from 38% last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the most influential country in Mexico and in most Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country suffered and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot, scattered ballot papers in the jars, looting polling offices and intimidations were presented
The polling stations would open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who had been displaced following the January earthquake, would go to the vicinity to find out where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community prudently stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapist, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support from voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower to reach the second round.
With an angry cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake who still live in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganisation.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this is its highest level since its election in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, obviously in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income on will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has subsided into the disarray following Mr Kirchner's death of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one member of Parliament struck one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend on will.
The economy overheats widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage claims from trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now adjust these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation eroded the growth rate after a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government entered into an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towardss an agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it west some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which resembles a prelude to the consolidation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very keen.
When the Argentines returned from their summer vacation in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her had declined.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate her husband's many policies without sound.
Half an hour for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented themselves on November 27, 70% of eligible persons, to elect municipal mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for feelings vis-à-vis the continent, having developed innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My success in the test, but that's right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including tapping country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum outfits.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, held an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters towards the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid establishing its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from activating the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the cradle.
China has not wasted any time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has been reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
He was a challenger for explicit independence from 2000 to 2008.
But a new generation of moderates came under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can commit himself to Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems to be overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results had they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic one, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite a dizzying economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson said his office and his local antennas would be remodeled.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to become aware of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama to take place at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a major appointment in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not go out more than three albums before recording; which "set up the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding compared to the brilliant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "tool album" category, a turning on a reviving frisson of a recording that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by Veteran Saxophonist James Moody and "Positotly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored with the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest to "Treme" of HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognitions in the whole category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic appointments for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscaped musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the appointments, we quote Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
Classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
One category for the classic producer of the year is five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos.3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daughty du Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnat Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was appointed for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he soon wrote the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the mandoline Avi Avivital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the category of orchestra benefits, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a Stravinsky works record.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalists-solists; here are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project is successful in approving the planning commission.
A Temecula mosque project received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics have taken part in the project by claiming that it is promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners held on Wednesday evening that the new religious centre respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Temecula Valley Centre, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice takes it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very loud voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at speaking time almost equally distributed, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"There's no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"The America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 were carried out in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really "foreign" way of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday's Science Journal.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough not to work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; so, researchers have assumed that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways of shaping life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at first," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research has been funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two four-fly exposure dogs outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two cordis pembroke Welsh - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the sheriff's department of Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and healthy, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, had disappeared until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National AKC/Eukanuba Championship in Long Beach, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests planned in the days prior to the exhibition "AKC/Eukauba", Peek said at the Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the canine exhibition tour of almost one month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and corgis in thicker fur in the truck where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit, so the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal New York bankruptcy judge officially leased on Thursday the "pre-packed" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be cleared; opening the way for the entertainment business, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no more legal obstacles remain before MGM to float under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become directors-general of what will be an alleged studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at departure.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and to meet the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, sales to auctions attracted few bidders among whom none of them was willing to pay the additional 2 billion that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again when the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive premiums of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's businesses, which have collected $375,000 per month for their management services, will receive a "first success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch MGM's production, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be realized by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Toys Tech to keep your budget gifts balanced
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important gap in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholeale Club BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength, while at the same price if not a little less than last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known ones, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button-mounted toys are increasing, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of an Indian pig who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel blocking.
Children who have broken the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a 80s child, you will remember Alphae, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a back bag filled with questionnaire game cards designed to turn a ride into a session with a self-correction and valve rack.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to provide electronic games and books and has a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a light box, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an on-line pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) that includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit from Club Penguin for two items to choose from.
It can be wheelchair skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10 for 5 years and over) is the last battery micro-robots.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It is fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to order maintenance in China
Tang Shenbin was running a place in the city like a coaching urban sergean, seriously inspecting his nerve charges, emitting orders with a military authority in a low voice.
He wanted women members of Chegguan - leaders of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and thought of violence - to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be handsome!"
Show them, he says, "What do the pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored dresses and pants, looked at the guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, in line with the rule.
Four hats perfectly lined at the top of hair attached by a knot striped in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"Models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong exchanged green grey uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with a strong look: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the Colporteur packed his cases and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, yellow and young.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulty drawing attention to this underground urban brigade from China
And because of that, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them while dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, stolen and posted, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry worker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the assault of street vendors.
"Chenguan has marked the government," he lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after a huge controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or were only tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; they are the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temper and the "indoor qualities."
The women of Chegguan are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of facial features.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
"We can't let a person who boxes or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apple cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not regard the enhancement of her appearance as gender, she says.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a wasted air.
Xu Yang, her colleague at 21-year-old caskets, said, "Our job is to present the city's image."
They did not oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply hunting out sellers in the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much as possible small bread or tofu bowl before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu as a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-carrette to noodles.
Agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread of false rumors that chegguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and police officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of placid houses Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike cried out in the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the face of the sinister face, took a elbowed path to their vehicle and left at full speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, male coordinators, aged 40 or older, are purely supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"At times, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li, "it's a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the public is starting."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice raised the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the woman's husband, announced Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential until the scandal around his case made the major national titles last year and harmed his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during a campaign in Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of policy donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called lobbying door ban.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be reluctant to pursue policy after a number of high-level reversives by its public integrity section, including last year's decisions to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of citizens' responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and followed up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the prosecution.
"I am not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an inquiry following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martled" the Ministry of the Interior on a contentious issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allelegiant Air, and he asked the transport secretary to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after undertaking Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electors and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to fight a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that he hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were being tapped away in the ranks of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and children attached to their beds in a house that was burned down.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in the court that sketches arguments of appeal, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing, is that intense reports on the trial - as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere ", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by public passions.
The request could lead the appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms undermines the human rights of a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleu of the Superior Court of State, rejected the claims in the judgement made last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been encouraged by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
Appeal courses have recognized for decades that the media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's murder, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeal judges may be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms might allow for more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who are likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes when the jury was selected.
Some of the jurors reported being horrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley, and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge has unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who has been criticized by the prosecutors, and that he has unduly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to a deliberations on a weekend.
The jurors have not been kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the position of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media was constantly turning on the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily tweeting of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "they didn't look like anything that had been seen here before, in New Haven, and maybe even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion, that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the press releases were slower, was a ludistic view that would undermine the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, representing Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civilization bring the cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invetiveness and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a foreword of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not cause any breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the session of the "Boyy Dog".
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. empty notation point partisan.
The commission's Wednesday public meeting on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but that still divides members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and testing each other to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Both parties remain within miles of taxation, spending, health care or rights.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed over the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections give rise to partisan passions and then disappear.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boitous duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or whole, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is likely to be made on the extension of unemployment benefits, because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of reducing taxes on the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is set on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "boxy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" Pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame Duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the Chamber and to the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reversing the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own opinion, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plans as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The highest resistance remains among the group's elected members; this suggests that there is little reason or will to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first one will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, given that the Republicans are challenging Obama with regard to budget, tax and health care; then being followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the response of the public.
The one who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, this week's civilization could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be required from both sides to find a ground of understanding on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents released describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and leads to the Kremlin some of the wine pots and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its part while the money moves up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
It was written while Iuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he said what follows on a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by a overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy's report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime led some people to name it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government acted more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "top " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the Moscow government.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note points out that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their cases close on one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy's note transmits reports of men bringing bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would rise to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the Non-Governmental Organization Transparency International (countries are at least classified as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy's note, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, would certainly remove discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the statements that US diplomats had divulged by calling him Batman and bringing up Robin's Medvedev.
"The problem rests on the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Veterans of Red Khmers forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with low-quality decrepit concrete walls, the manager of the secondary school of Anlong Veng referred to the man who built it, the last leader of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouges in northwest Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge visited the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed to it a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, at 35 years in prison, the former chief of the sad-known torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In view of this development, anxiety has increased among former combatants of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouges but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overturned the U.S. Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to undermine the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Red Veterans have plunged into black poverty, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many of them remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some Khmer Red elite officers have kept their local leadership positions in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are unskilled farmers at low grade and file levels.
"These people have received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are implicated with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a business environment is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeding everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs."
The current Khmer Rouge Court has also raised concerns here.
The court should, early next year, begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the top leaders and the main perpetrators of crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond these four cases.
It takes more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem came back from work to the field located near his wooden house on a pilot, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who damaged the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians challenged this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at the high school in Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he came back with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet, the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the weeds and spread out of plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black silk, covered with a rusty roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, who sold mobile phones on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated here.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants will go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last place of rest where she would leave a bunch of mature bananas hoping to bring luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Foreign Minister of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military quality uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of around 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Safety Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit.
"It proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton described the agreement as "very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have maintained highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and low enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus drew close to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials indicated.
It was loaded on a special train which traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, indicated those responsible.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented with a view to building confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a manager of the Energy Department specializing in the Reduction of the Global Threat.
According to estimates by the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium of military quality this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has expressed no objection to CIA flights
The government has expressed no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading towards Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked for the Spanish Executive to be informed to "be able to prove that they exercised adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero Government off-the-shelf" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to prevent them from being "taken away," says Aguirre in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as she was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to seek the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than the declassified information of the NIC or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the Ambassador of the United States and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented to him that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a ignited rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has deliberately tolerated or ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that passed to confessions complained in the network of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur à la Galicienne"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used when she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of Coruña whose origin she was.
Messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
With him, she's been cohabiting for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to rock the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she is in Minorque, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it was a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like it, let her leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until 19, because I have to come to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything was all right, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person if this person is not my mother," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she taps it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to have been murdered on the 10th of that month, is dead.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but he is not."
"On the one hand he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other, he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) a few hours in the summer and so I save some money from the baby-sitter."
The 17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos on the e-mail, you see, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm ahead of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Terreur à la galicienne (epigraphe) " .
The last man who lived with her, on the watch, expresses her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had happened so that she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered Palma's provincial penitentiary yesterday from the judicial detention centre in Minorque.
Office lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the facts had happened, "and neither did she intend to harm the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would earn 4 seats in Congress and the CSP would lose 9 seats in Congress.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these comencies normally doubles the one it receives in Catalans.
For example, the Catalan populace received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while the autonomy in 2006 was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the CSP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the CPP could go from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and CSP would lose no more or less than 9 Members (at 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a member of Parliament - he has three of them now - while ICV would keep a member of Parliament or win one of them.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relay to the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree with the fact that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the chance to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic that this training loses its representation in the City Hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including Mayor Angel Ros, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, Thailand there were three of them.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by officers of the General Information Commissioner of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Les Tigres pour la libération de la Terre Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "was disabled" Al Qaida's counterfeiting device at international level and therefore "its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations involved, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be similar blows the following days to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained, another took place in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who were leading the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connects prisoners in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of stolen passports in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
However, it must be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the integrals of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC's leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur Mas's conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which resolves to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that she obtained 18 Members at the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make herself loved, because the candidate from CiU requires at least one of the trainings that will be carried out by the opposition to abstain in the vote of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are taking place in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to undermine the political machinery of a very over-exaggeration of self-government and the elimination of tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be taken care of by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The managers of the Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmaé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for during the period he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with counsel from the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the responsible" for the dead but "law and responsibility compels us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discretion that the entity may suffer for failing to detect on time the criminal activities of the infirmary at night, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmaé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - which he suspected in many cases that no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was done by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an index of recklessness on the part of anyone other than the accused."
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of staff from the centre to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them inside by giving them lassive as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the range of October 12 - 17.
The Caritat does not believe the nurses' statements at night, nor do they eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted suddenly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that prevented "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The differentials of the devices have closed down and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to deceive ourselves, and the euro has hardly recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative closets.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its ineffectiveness and elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the sale of unlimited access to quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and that they had collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Last year's one-year trading auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change of market feeling after Trichet's words.
Figures from Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and have a period of up to February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures can be assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, employment recovery measures sound to investors like the four seasons in Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange rose by 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with a strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to apply for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million cash available, triple compared to March, very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to appear."
Come on, let's get out of here!
The President of Eulen will challenge the Council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "null de droit", El Enebro's judicial council the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the company owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year whose challenge is recorded in the Register of Trade and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, reopened the tuna box within the Alvarez family.
The use of the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism which guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquirez is called by David Álvarez as a "unsatisfied remedy of the applicants' five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on January 18, according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged by considering that it is "nothing of all right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate convenes a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group calls for 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for a complaint for which there is not yet a indicated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all waged on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
The German Sebastien Vette, not to mention the ability of the Renault engine to drive his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
In reality, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching goals from the high motor competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thereby avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a short time, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment to analyze and design all kinds of changes on the bolides.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull Bolides except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a single limitation of this technology development madness, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bowls in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty have 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the enormous technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and which is not known.
The factory's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that R+D's progress in racing cars was 50% of the win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by IT, as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with its associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Vice-President Helena Herrero, Spain, gave as an example the renovated store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first ones opened were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have the same image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of trades claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already hired technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'flying' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's managing director Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it envisages a collapse of the margins of interest, which will try to compensate partially with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years one million private customers, his task to do.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will be valid for three years.
The aim, apart from surviving without needing to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by picking up a million new private customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can get out of the bank - its great task to do, because so far this bank had damaged more SMEs and companies than the individual client.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is productivity bet, or the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will complete this year's Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional fiscal year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business," he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war on liabilities - which penalises margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums paid by banks and cash companies for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't lock the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías on November 22 and 27-.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of undertaking corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will seek larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that the capital needs "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that the issue could not be issued, but, contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding could be obtained through rest, which mitigated the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the Spanish savings fund concentration trial began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were in reserve for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Funds (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it can't be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most has been fully achieved; it is possible that instead of going to 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Banque d'Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is carried out "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time limits established in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The 45 cash flow with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unequal trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain reminds us is that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
ECSC Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of 426 euros of aid to unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, from the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to his responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which is shocking to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, although now it looks like science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
At that time, she was strongly criticized, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published was against Greece's recovery.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable a country to recover and at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has rushed the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she does not think to cross.
And she tells all of us that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves discontinued and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked for is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquillity.
And we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard him in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with large businesses and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the the thesis that must be put in order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And one of the possibilities we are considering is that we cannot rule out the abandonment of a monetary zone that is too depleted by less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The deaf expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will carry out the regulatory sanction during the next game of the dam game against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team coach, José Mourinho and the players involved with two games.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather a common practice in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of theethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his anthem shows nobility and honor and who on previous occasions condemned his players to a fine for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, that adds an episode more to his dilated history of hystrionic and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate asks whether such behaviour expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions are a fraud of law; because they are indeed respectful actions with the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm that they cause in the sport spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of the goods mentioned with the right game is to avoid the team of the infringing players benefiting in an unfair way from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it is not appropriate for them to normally characterize themselves as fraud or fraud of the law, because their violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as it is to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the kind of advantage that offenders gain from the deliberate errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put ourselves in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty match and pass into the second round of cards, in which suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, of which it is still part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but they chose rather the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without playing the penalty or fleeing the penalty.
Although the boundary between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, I think, appears due to two factors: because there were two self-ejections and because of how to transmit the guideline to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to collect Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December comes they also come to dinner groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the accounting process, this year's calendar (like the night of Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of 13 December, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirm the president of Gremi de Restació de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrès.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to get out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he said.
The case will be "for those who give good quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down one step with the crisis, so that the slice around the 25 euro has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre, there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boost of applications for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the context, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the specificity of the calendar has assumed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros", they detail.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine produced according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its Vice-President, Enric Gomà, trusts the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall bookings are "animated", even though customers "negotiate at most".
That is true, the hope for holidays has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy of Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details they offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decrease" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones, "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan employs staff with strong religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy dispatch, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a high-ranking anti-terrorist fighter to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it is dated 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents in the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The 20 International Police Corps based in Lyon, France, issued Sweden's order at request, but did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have been indicated to identify or locate Assange "to obtain her provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red appeal as a free way to arrest -- which the national police body must realize -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by video-conference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentity Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missile denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they urge the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as " ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself charged a high-ranking anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
The trial of President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute any person providing contributions or assistance".
Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has come back to his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use a plane without crew or something similar."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"The one who is in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eyes on the fans of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for resolving the last internal revolt within ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches that he had with other extinguishing currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelashes that allow him to block until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By means of ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the cardinals want to pass a certain penalty vote to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified by half another one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than to make his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will vote on the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the convention for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of the ERC has admitted that the "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all capable of washing its laundry as a family.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of Puigcercós' ideology, the owner of Innovation thought that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e., to include new figures from the carod's apceptive sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the conduct of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion directed the management to revise the assembly model at a specific convention for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years has not recommended that this issue be addressed.
Now, without critical sectors in the assemblage, the time could be good for taking it back and closing it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in Mexico State, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of Mexico State.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut out in the Mexico Valley.
During the past month of the year 390 deaths were recorded in organized crime theory.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the shot of thanks to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned on the road Mixtecs in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalan municipality.
Early on Thursday morning, the four, the owners of shared land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the collection of garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head shot impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front one found a man's body on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body one found a bullet struck with firearms of 25 caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black waters channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
Tepotzotlán residents warned of the discovery of a body that was in Peña Colorada, the hands attached behind and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the safe of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, while two messages of death warning were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony one found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two women were found in the village of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the morning following the location of the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck we found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Aquautla.
On the woman's skin we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, the body of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head of the ruby and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the San Agustín Colony's Center of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second one had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 ensured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and had detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent before 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that its country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he exposed the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings targets, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he stated, there are various multi-year plans in progress or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another one for the change of filament lamps by saving lamps and another one for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to the government of that country with regard to climate change, ensured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained that the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, she has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make it a similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The National PAN leader explained that the former bread leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez has ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former bread leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of the Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to make a claim to the National Council Order Commission, where appropriate, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that it is not time to think of 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, when a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The bread leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we will taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to elect the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, so it would give the answer "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the revival of the party in the elections on 4 July will be reflected on the next debate, even though "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "many hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prisoners to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Grutari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armour'," he said.
He stated that the Federal Executive may make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no stake in the country, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today with the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama said.
Its short message maintains an open cyber link with a wider document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as voting on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the Bush tax reductions and government funding were extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we need to solve this tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted on from Thursday next in the Senate, even though it would be most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But partisans require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the competition of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project are involved in intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they were not going to support him on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature you put your finger on the wound
The second step of language pleasures was a walk in which participants made the presentation of the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and that this time used the title of his question (while another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... put us in a trance", slowly launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "wheat" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: " Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrating approach with the traumatologist who cut off his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighs relieved and concludes: "On the wound I could only know that it is actually open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling story he called Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but is discovered at a given time.
With touch of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorority who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone away or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a story that turned to speak America, the great news that had its own chroniclers from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the stories of the conquering captains.
"Servans who invented us all (the writers) have mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that even lacked the powder."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "the madmen and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to his legacy that we're talking about."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table He owes Him on the wound.
The Cuban-Porto-Channel has placed itself on the great scourge of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "this must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "late every statement there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put your finger on the wound and to disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he did not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine finally consoled himself with the underchampion medal, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santiste strategy arrived at its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament when it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure it also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournoi Bicentenary 2010, again against the Devils, Rubén once again suffered a reverse, as his team made a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival to the tournament, so he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to separate himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that the institution is more important to him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," he said when asked him what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last finish, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee blows the end, we can't celebrate, we're prepared on the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot us were already prepared to run and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the penalty series, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we are prepared, the previous tournament has been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety to hold the title between our hands, he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will not get back in that situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a underchampian technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the process of visa processing at the Embassy and Consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide some advantages for the aspirants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a need to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the visa processing and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspiring will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not have to engage in an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the nearest AUC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants wishing to make a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/bolletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that it would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculations from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems we're talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an atmosphere that we thought was too Venemous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any event, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the biggest satellite in Saturn), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposing 'block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just moved in when the Congress appeared to be an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonn' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, did they repeat, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the directorate chaired by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally, we constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from a political will and if they did not, they would be served again by the two parties and thus the opposite coalition will end.
"Until now (the opposite coalition), this is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he went on, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartisanism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Member's personality, to give him his seat at the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave with a couple of agreements outside of 5 which will probably be Members, now the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we decided to join in order to find a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform that they did, that they decided, we're outside and we don't agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Hall pays another check to the owner of the electric equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mayor.
With it, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipal Transparency Page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what he's owed, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, on 19 October, on 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, in accordance with the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Northwest had published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, revealing that in the period of March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the City Hall paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundpoint in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Dorada Zone, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad street and sidewalk conditions affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid close trades.
"Politics only know that it means closing a business one day and they don't know how much fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Host José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the visitor's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Mayor.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not just making the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the Mayors must change their strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has clean in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We haven't paid them the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that's known to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under the secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to get in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Heuriously Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should first be ordered, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP requests results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges facing them.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a work legislature that is dignified and free of agreement between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was installed by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new elements of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges facing them.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make covenants to secure their own interests and they become a carnival mask for governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges for the current Governor to make progress.
"We will ensure that they are doing a decent job and especially committed to society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 people's representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is inconsistent as an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and competes directly with agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources have to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help to provide certainty to the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislations have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a magic king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wish of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, for their home is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live up to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell Mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see my son', because he was very expensive', they remember with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shoes size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, shoes size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six size would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream come true for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment that were used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Spokesman of the Sureté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Persons arrested were to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with allegations of cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
About 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Étrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Regie participated in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative Bill that, according to the government, should solve the problem of ships in charge of clandestine migrants, is obviously going to be beaten while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for the holding of up to one year anyone from a ship identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Chief of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms of his party that are not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers, and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative Bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," explained Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring Canadians' will.
"Canadians say massively to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections when it rejected it.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member of Parliament who would oppose it would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not act unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
Minister of Public Safety Robert Dutil argued that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Standing Council on the Police Services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the public security critique, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit coming out of a hat" and "a brigidled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, just say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest refuses not to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign from Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent scout is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments to this case.
During the spring 2001 operation, which hit the motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently adopted the Gangsterism Act.
High-supervised rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance because of the severe precipitation that has taken place in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slide would have taken place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There's a road down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell over several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The northern areas of the river and the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of total rain.
As these precipitations must be added to the already accumulated snowmelt in some areas, there are fears that several streams of water will overflow.
Warnings of flood alert were issued on Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Safety for the Oureau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood guards and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall led to the flooding of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julian, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overrun of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on the alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Crusades Forecast Centre issued warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, including Maskinongé, L'Assumption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly Blame Dupont
Quebec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont has had a partial reversal before the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as its gross language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI team 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that did not fit the broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CNRC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of Social Assisted Persons.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the show were inaccurate.
Animators need to provide strong information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the Committee ' s members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont the noon" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been taken on him.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had then turned to a media face-to-face that had provoked a lot of reactions.
CHOI's animator said he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because we couldn't know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during hours of wide listening within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealers of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for some fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the game on the ground present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as commission for the UPS company has just issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories, he explained."
"Now I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
"The fighters who finished out of the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and feet, as well as projections to the ground, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugillist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most elevated and most prestigious in China," explained the sympathetic Gaillard.
"It's a bit the equivalent of Lampinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro, did he analyze?"
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face their final category."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies that obtained the most important, that of project management, for an amount of $295 million without tendering.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in a manner consistent with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium created the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is the new way to collide and break down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this secretly, are now doing it in an open way," said Pequist MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said he had difficulty seeing how the public's interest could be used in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied in the afternoon, denying strongly that there was a collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she insisted, arguing that the PQ had been "bad" and had "missed rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a limited alliance over time that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is due to be phased up to 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition playing; there was negotiation.
As a result, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devour, the consortium formula in the engineering council sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overhaul of Quebec's business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory has responded to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s."
The major employer of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), provided an explanation that made a mockery of the fact that the project's management contract was granted on a voluntary basis.
"If you go on a bid call and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has increased 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including his participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau left it clear that the PQ is also linked to these "financial" companies, before stating that they were rather his leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer in Quebec has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and eco-friendly certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, although bathing in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption pull, deplores a lack of credible information, lack that he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, indicates the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebecers seem to be giving very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University Consumer Observatory responsible.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be co-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speech on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information seems to be crucial in stimulating this currently animated consumption bread by about one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the void and doubtful nature of the information would soothe the burns of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
On the other hand, a third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they seek to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were about half in 2010 to change their habit and above all to change the brand name of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from shoppers in their neighborhoods and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Quebec's Consumer Homo likes to appear as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or recommended co-vehicles to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioural survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which it was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but with only one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full movie vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to involve itself in the file, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of government offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He sent him a last report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the firm reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to answer.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's donation must really be removed.
Let's remember that the Association of the owners of cinemas and cinema parks of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which he did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the environment were calling for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, held the cinema as author for ten years in his premises of the complex after he himself financed its construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films was crying out in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to be loyal to his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot a private financing campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallelle, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February next by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Duty and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals that are being made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States considers to be the lowerity complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but at the same time betray the feeling of superiority to Canada.
Thus, US diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more eye-catching details than substantial content to put into the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in the full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gave some explanation to this situation.
"A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may make Canada's political leaders talk about internal issues of daily life rather than bringing this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the elephant proverbial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands all the less the "surgent silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"S logically, does he think the ability of a candidate, a party and more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the government's survival in the early February federal budget confidence vote, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan," writes Mr. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast at CBC refer to the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's Muscle Interrogations.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the responsible for this massive flight should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations proposed a domestic, commercial and industrial lighting renovation plan in Cancún in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GHG) that corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the incandescent bulbs which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diodes bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the planetary car park emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt balance in order to stabilize by 2020 the increase in climate at 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy disappears in heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs average 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturing Philips this week - this company has also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations to fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and they need to be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulb, but rather coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of election results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the United Nations leader.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the interim results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission left the deadline for Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the CIS had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday around the world to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposing Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudual" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the coup d'état missed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the campaign of intimidation of the voters practiced by the FNs in the north of the country had dissuadeed the supporters of the president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who disagrees with the former rebels, found the delay in announcing the results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that bringing complaints before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IDB) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% counting overseas departments), showing the adjusted data of provisional seasonal variations (SVCs) published Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the population in metropolitan areas and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More generally, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a further increase in unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The seniors experienced a slight rise in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points per three months and one year), 482,000 people aged 50 years or older, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini examined and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and destroyed at the Luynes detention house, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini was examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, repression, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, to make the judge pass before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday night and ruined.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to handle.
As for the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never had knowledge of them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on encountering the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts he's been charged with."
"The instructor magistrate has taken this into account by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is pursued for "trafficing of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined one for "removal and diversion of public goods by one person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicated diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini was Stéphane Brunengo-Giard, recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies that they have been used to clean up money from big banditry.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from the city of La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spinning", held the opinion in haleine in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything in the eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on the treatment of their own "hate" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not, in return, been the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials to the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Elysée Counsellor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals held in force in Iran.
"Do sound," they say in the media, "throw in the media the words "rights of the fundamental man", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more so that the Iranians ask you not to do it."
For, after attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not regulate anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilating maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, when she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (EUR 230 000).
And it reveals that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iran Majid Kakavand, whose US claims extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is targeting Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear equipment, Majid Khakavand's expansion is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The release of Iran from the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier made sure that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, has not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée advisor makes up a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, Elysée does not make any effort, by means of media releases and "futes", to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears its fruits as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the "blitz" media of French officials".
On what is so based on "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their laudable statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée paid in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immature".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion in Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it from Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country."
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, have indicated representatives of the Ministries of Culture and the Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental officer responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, he said.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit their daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are applying for them, the manager added.
It will also make available to people who demand free software to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In full turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates Thursday the World Cup organizing countries 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may take a step on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the queen competition of Fifa will take place in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of delegates (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emir, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measurement of the economic and political issues of a World Cup.
Backstage treatments are therefore likely to last for the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temari and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, a football cradle that only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC gave up a layer on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that pinned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to disappoint Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on an intense lobbying these past few weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the coup successfully by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organization of the JO-2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore the British flag to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could give rise to their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, became an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (statements, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced a "loyal competition in the preparation of the vote", in an allusion barely veiled to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared as the logical favorites.
First world economic power, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long run on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the World-2026 award to China, which would in fact lead to the collapse of Asian chances by 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of paid TV rights (because of the time shift) by European countries, the nerve of the war on Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
One mandate to Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not good at cleaning up with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then you have to make it as if doubt still existed.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even if not believed, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that he would make his decision "someone takes part in the fall of 2011".
Let him mention before MPs UMP, Tuesday evening in Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a bit of weakness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The President simply pointed out that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years to two.
He made a note, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the president, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"To the worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His previous remarks do not make him more candidate than the previous day; they do not make him less.
If they give comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race, on the one hand.
But this isn't the high school entrance of Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because its application in 2012 is clear that many of the PS are calling for an early battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP up there," immediately and cautiously reacted to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for the exit of the crisis or, at least, to announce the closure of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt is binding, and the Frankfurt issuing institute will probably not be able to allow itself to be as permanent as it is to worsen a situation that is more than currently being laid down in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchasing programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)."
The previous day, in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissert as to his intentions, simply stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will retain its main unchangeable policy rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect significant changes either.
If loans operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's significantly changing her program."
"If not, it would be to take the risk of causing new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Comerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipated by Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to stimulate an atone market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is at all costs necessary to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," testified an important mandatory manager yesterday.
For if interest rates are on the rise, States will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt or to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns its back
After a worrisome beginning of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline of compulsory rates at 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the region said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and expect a "unforeseen" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the difference with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had fluctuated at 263 points, leading to a certain influx in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" by "the turbulence of the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the tone of tax returns that goes with, running to the state the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate table on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, it calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the rumor of a new budget group that could be set up after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have been repeating him for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," said Pier Carlo Paduan, a leading OECD economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the House of Deputies, following which early elections could be held by the end of March.
It would then open up a period which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have still demonstrated it on Sunday and at night, are of course solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," says economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more generally, with their G20 peers go well.
This is also for the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings in the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro-zone countries in the market sector (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a round of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-east investors of the crisis developments in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the land.
The first EFSF securities issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are on the front line, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to more effective austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both are at all costs to avoid asking for international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are necessary to restore lasting confidence.
European donors are finally talking about the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of sovereign bonds markets.
On the move to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advance of the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand it over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading actor in the European sovereign debt market, felt that an extension of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments en vigilante orange
Negeous episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and are likely to disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now under orange supervision due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowy episodes are quite remarkable enough to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, predicts Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned with heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to gendarmes that recommend taking its vehicle only in case of need and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardia.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invits all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly due to future snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, the billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro is to be built by the Society of the Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow some of the funding of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Financial Corrigendum Act, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a realignment of a tax on offices that already exist "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Society of Grand Paris".
How much would that account for?
Mystery.
It is not numbered in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the state and brought to the Society of the Grand Paris as the project moves," can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the GSP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the moment that revenue is created (the two taxes, ndlr), one can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion later, it is explained."
"This will be included in the budget and taken up and up to date."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion are still for missing subscribers, is likely to trigger a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revengers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears only as a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could be read for months in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinister caricature profile was for long time for cabaret artists sketch material.
The rule that secret records should be composed only of news already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And that is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do unprecedented research (he does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who go to occultism only believe in what they already know, and who confirm what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) the chief of secret services (unless he could be, I know, editor at Libération), who retains only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have become spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it's only through hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a welcome blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims as much in crisis as the "boreals".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could conceive all power like a Big Brother who was controlling every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy has been fully proven since, in order to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's revenger - may know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets keep?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secrecy, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks didn't do any harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made too much damage to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on line any information reserved - this would be published on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that for now, my forecast is about science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who travel discreetly in uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at the very least, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key closed drawers: the Watergate's spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now progressing in crabs, i.e. backstage.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
Video cassettes (analogics) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (numerics) allow only to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macro portions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communication policies and techniques return to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being done in the secret of the embassies.
It is now the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Bidouille’s Promises of Financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review compliance with the promises of fast-disbursed funding (such fast-start or early-start funding) carried out by developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out of the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated for its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 EUR 2.2 billion has been released, which puts it on the right track for compliance with its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, some Member States of which France had blocked the procedure.
Today, each one chooses the reference that is best suited to him.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" of the year 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
In effect, France's total support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution between gifts and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that €1 loaned is equal to €1 given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often projects related to emission mitigation based on more efficient technologies), it is a mistake to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to a euro given... Moreover, it should only be counted on under its commitments as the cost of lending for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has only made such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In summary, in its fast-start funding, France operates a double fraud: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, she can make it appear that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a negative double impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in negotiations as developing countries are not fully aware of...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year's early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape from the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are accounted.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of a nature to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Warning to children-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old child swallows on one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (former Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought food generally consumed in four meals and one in a day by a child of about ten years in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris between July and September.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as chills, have been examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogenic and five substances classified as carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain cancers as well as about 20 residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for by the study, presents traces of six chemicals, of which a fungicide is still prohibited in France.
Same thing for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, the tin in box, and even the bread wand and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Greens (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "to address the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported on the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
