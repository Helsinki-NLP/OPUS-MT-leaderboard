Cumulative rapid progressive incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Disease Control and Prevention Centre informed the causing agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary artery disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, i.e., an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of Hubei Province in China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5, 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Acquisition of cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of notified cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases from each country until 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m., and we compare them with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including update testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalization in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011.
Modelled scenarios related to the saturation of the health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity of intensive treatment beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that the cases have so far concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally meet a defined regional coverage population, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, such as in affected regions of Italy.
As noted in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronary artery disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by coronary artery disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which develops rapidly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks following the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus has a great similarity to the coronary virus (COV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called COV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number one public enemy", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article aims to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by COV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and forecast of the disease, as well as the other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice found highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of VOC in the documented history of human beings.
As shown in Fig.1.1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequencing of the CoV was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, the contact of health professionals was communicated, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of onset of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until this report, the disease has already spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is rapidly deteriorating, the final size and severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qH2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, especially in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and in its environment.
The COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The average time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
Glucoprotein spike (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (AEC2) and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively and subsequently membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsidene proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original location of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was found that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human protein ECA2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the human cryo-EM structure of ECA2 of total length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the transporter of amino acids B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a number, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by means of civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bats similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of the species and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-term seal mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being awaited (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with a humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in the deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, especially on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host by means of standard recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectine receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receiver (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoural immunity, including supplements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at the worst of the hypotheses, multiple organ failure, and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence of symptoms in a group of people, affects more elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that the health authorities adjust the effective time of quarantine based on the most precise period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not exhibit symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually the initial and main symptom of the COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, chorus, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the symptoms of the disease appear.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the lung imaging diagnosis, should go through screening to the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a population study in 2012 showed that patients at MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the patients at COVID-19, which consists of the highest mortality of MRSE compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MRS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, when confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the confirmed 8.096 cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and that of SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it was reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and cured patients who received discharge from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral blood white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobin in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count presented a progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19 and present irregular bilateral shadows or opaque dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR).
When ADDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious results of chest X-ray usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of the COVID-19 demonstrated the clearance of pneumonia, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncicial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ADDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of the polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as a main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour without the need for complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, at the best of their capacity, palliative treatment for patients at COVID-19, at the same time as trying a variety of therapies that were previously used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response directed to T cells; blocking IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
However, short treatment periods with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marburg.
Subsequently, rembesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients treated usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who cured of the COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered cautiously.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excess immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma demand is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportions.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or triage for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Chinese Traditional Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and fellow workers published a comparative study between exclusive treatment with Western medicine and combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await more properly controlled tests on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious disease that can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
Moreover, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-insomnia, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidity, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, symptoms of psychosis, delirium and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of the actions of the public health system against the epidemic of COVID-19, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who had contact with them, as well as to the general population who needed it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and people infected to susceptible hosts, and are usually complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and durable neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these candidates for vaccine in older individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses still need to be determined before a clinical study begins.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS outbreaks continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MRS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the VOCs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (with an average age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlations and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the result.
These enzymes are expressly present in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other questions for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as an attached therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Considering that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they pass through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and testify to the death of loved family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), in a manner similar to other coVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or incubation period may produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the epidemic of SARS.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, hoping to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornet rubble of patients who recovered and received discharge from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising evidence occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, finally.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker with respect to its infection and, at some point, becomes a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable by cough and spiral and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fetal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, work colleagues and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent droplets of fluids from a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or becoming attached to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of mirions with size from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use isolation jackets to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a major warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020 the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproducibility among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left the people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this tough lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal medical and authorities communications; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently deliver targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve society's response system periodically.
The epidemic of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sensation of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than with SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular testing of RNA for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of bats similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original host, of the bat, let's say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to Questions Nos 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical trials have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or will it have seasonal recurrence, like influenza?
It is essential, but it may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the necessary efforts, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an infection with HCoV can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous usefulness.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of host animals has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating the interactions of the host of the CoV in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of the CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we compare and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective on the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple tape RNA.
These viruses with the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in an electronic microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have non-segregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two overlapping open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoVs strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most HCVs and is subdivided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of rangeCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of the species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human coVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms such as a common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of development of acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDR) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coriza of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which cause autolimiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the present and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCOV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current coronary heart disease epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the driving force and the restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search by the reservoir hosts, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration among species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoV’s parental viruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission interspecies to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
The CoVs of animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the coriander of patients who contracted common cold, different coVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, canundong, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, spir, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in mice brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the period of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCOV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCOV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it was estimated that each contaminated person may contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and high creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients at some point require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been dedicated to research on HCOV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its incidence of peaks occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in a community way, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Just as HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four HCoVs acquired in a community way have adapted well to human beings and are generally less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has been reported recently as a cause of severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by laboratory have origin in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and in Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MRS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MRS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, which made MERS-CoV one of the most devastating human knowledge viruses.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuous epidemic of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, in the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of the evolution of HCOV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired in a Community way (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during HCoV infection acquired in a community way, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in HCoVs acquired in a community way and in SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing on to human beings, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It is still necessary to be clarified in future studies if the oro-focal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in certain circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can display seasonality, as in cases of HCoVs acquired in a community way.
In any event, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its transition to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All HCoVs acquired in a Community way that causes mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient HCOV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate themselves in humans to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four Community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to human beings, and their transmission among human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the opportunity to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in a community way.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as HCoVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired in a community and less pathogenic way than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural ones, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCoV if it houses a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses HCoV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCOV or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt properly to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transient manner and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
A HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endlessness.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero patient of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Further investigations of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG, compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxinim in the live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was corroborated indirectly by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could be only the amplifier intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close-relationship bat CoV, named CoV HKU3 Rhinolophus bat related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat-ferred bat.
These bats are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other coVs of bats share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bats, but no CoV, with the exception of designated WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
It is known that the human angiotensin 2 (AEC2) converting enzyme is the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from faecal samples of bats was demonstrated to use ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as a receptor for cell entry.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent patients of SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor with closer relation to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bats and the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 of bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor as dipeptidil-peptidase 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to betaCoV counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV was found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the dromedaries are seropositive to specific MERS-CoV neutralization antibodies, in the same way as camels in the Middle East in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedaries, increased evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noted that generally mild symptoms, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed plausibly to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a RATG13 bat CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to be attributed to a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical coVs of bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of animal transmission to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (javanic Manis) could also host ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RaTG13, with about 90% identity at nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolim is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that confirms the direct origin of the pandolim SARS-CoV-2 due to the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the panzolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pandolim, the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the largest genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the betaCoVs beta-coVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 derives from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter argument is in favour of the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOVs, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses was also studied.
phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have originated from bats CoVs, while parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a coV of bats called ARCoV.2 (CoV of Appalachian Ridge) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another bat VC, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that the camelides are their intermediate hosts.
For more clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCOV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of bat virus to humans.
First, human beings, but not the alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, human beings have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs of bats related to HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the alpacas obtain from humans alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E.
Actually, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a HCoV-229E genetic pool, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries for humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in the dromedaries dates back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is causing a mild disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through the slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been newly introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced by domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple tape RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered "moderated" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessive high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of the VOC by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation of the CoVs is almost one million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, which suggests its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of the RNA in CoVs exercises extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolutionary, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of single reading tables and protein functions encoded in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing vessel, the exchange of tapes occurs frequently during transcription of the RNA of the CoV.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
phylogenetic evidences of natural recombination were found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 as well as in animal coVs, such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates of human and civic beings, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes a rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in protein S DLR.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is highly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in fragment S1, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its corrections for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize ECA2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and guaxin dogs, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and from civets in the DLR, and four of them are located on the receptor binding ground for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 unit implies that the binding affinity of its protein S with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrector may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCOV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different portion of protein S.
There are several other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidasis N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these coVs into human beings after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and HCoVs natural reservoir hosts such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the factors of dependence with the host and overturn the factors of restriction of the host to an effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of host virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tending screening at the host's genome level and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCoVs arise: back to stake zero
The diversity of the coVs of bats provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a HCoV genetic pool.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also boost the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since the viruses of bats related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of exclusion of nucleotide 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Exclusion divides ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and rangeCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombined with other animal coVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of the selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the pressure of the host’s immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCOV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, alpaca alphaCoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural extermination cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the inhibitor receptor of natural extermination cells NKG2/CD94, and to the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive species (ERO) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains by being introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt the host.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic patients and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, where the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response was switched off from replication of the VOC.
The same strategy for switching off the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflammation NLRP3 in bats is deficient.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of inflammation NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was discovered that betaCoV of bats shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of bats that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that the civets and other animals in the markets contain viruses similar to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that the pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of the pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
The CoVs returned to world attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of animal zoonotic origins and reservoirs of HCoVs in transmission among human beings.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civets in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, the pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lines of betaCoVs of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of such transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the coVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic coVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new coVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle from the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to human beings, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, a pangolim or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the coronary heart disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Sixth version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is officially termed the 2019 conavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called conavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick online guidance guide published at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, it notes that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context in some.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We wear your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (Sixth trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological historical elements with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occur; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and near areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occur; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases group of cases (more or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic features by image of the infection with COVID-19; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronary virus; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or any change in the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increase in titre greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR exam for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tract was added to the second and third edition (18-22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth edition (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in searching for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us of attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, since it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we await the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide in good time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed registered cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, IEDCR's director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic of COVID-19 on March 11.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, Bengali minister of road transport and Obaidul Quader bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
This paralysis of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections in the world
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 worldwide dropped from one million, indicated data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronary virus.
This mark came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours before 10 a.m. in the Central European Timetable (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronary virus infections on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without coming to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency in 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended all day the duration of the curfew to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement pickup from 22h to 4h
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australian Woolworths and Coles store networks have reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and a transaction package in all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposed to store in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper with home delivery to a package on request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four transaction packages implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in her March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still exhausting the stocks in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand for "no precedents", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had an "increased increase" last week, according to a Woolworth spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To alleviate even more scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI had previously made available stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varegists, said retailers try to increase stocks, but that local board restrictions on truck delivery frequency make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, since suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion of Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail specialist at the University of Technology in Queensland, said stores are replenishing stock every night.
He stressed that the toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant amount in the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [bought] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces the toilet paper Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being made with buyers entering strike on the extended weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily print, included an insert of eight pages in order to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
Just as in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO emphasized the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for an answer, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres, is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside the influence, no other respiratory viruses have been monitored from the emergence to the continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronary virus".
And he went on "and we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, "in short, will get worse."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous coronary virus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome co-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It is estimated that the mortality rate is from 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, pick-up touches, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused severe global socioeconomic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the population in the world.
The disinformation on the virus spread online and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descendants and appearances of the East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industrial closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Wuhan sanitary authorities in China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
To a large extent, the cases had links with the Huanan Sea fruit wholesaler market and, therefore, it is believed that the virus has a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-caused virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close ties to the bat, pangolim and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms of knowledge became ill on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the posterior group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had links with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case was pointing to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei Province, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases declared decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's leading scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that, in China until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the cases reported.
The initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre concluded that it can be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official death count for the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and had positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, in homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episode reports of underreporting in the U.S.. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the estimates of fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1 – 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die because of a disease, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who die because of the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection through case resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Evidence Based Medicine Center of Oxford University estimates that the rate of lethality of pandemic infection is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of CFR.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, said that, "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when it will happen."
The senior medical adviser of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it may end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, declared that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly within 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I find it unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of recurrence will depend on group immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (cataro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results of the tests that confirm the infection, researchers therefore recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and closely examined to rule out infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio estimates range from some up to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory feeling was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and small drops produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, being the next contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by drops that remain for longer periods of air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing drops can also be produced during the expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The drops can lie in the mouths and noses of close people or, possibly, be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
Propagation may also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oro-fectal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although the ease with which the disease spreads is not fully clear, a person generally infected from two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in paperboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimate animals and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronaviruses related to its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by home soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgeneral Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same strain are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, throughout the genome, to other coronary samples coming from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolins virus and humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found a maximum of 92% of genetic material sharing between the coronavirus of the pandolin and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography (CT).
A study conducted in Wuhan, comparing RRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC is not used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually made available from a few hours a day.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal swab, although throat swab is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been sufficiently accurate to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved to be used in emergency only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of X-ray images and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric dark glass opacityes and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus infection, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of thoracic CT with those of PCR and demonstrated that, although the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of images of the virus with radiographs and CT.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper sheet and placing this scarf directly on a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential trips going or coming from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health professionals take care of individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by localization data governments from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for the COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinse your nose and squatting with colutories, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after touching your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises against touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (up to one minute of defectant exposure to a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected in case of suspicion or confirmation COVID-19 on a site.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the folded elbow or with a paper sheet when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any sheet.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask may limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory drops when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands." It has also been recommended to use masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as the caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (making 1 meter or less distance).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical mask is recommended when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks of cloth at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or cover your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear facial mask when leaving in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that all who enter supermarkets should wear a mask for the face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for the face in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of masks for the face on the street is mandatory. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who could not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone when they stay at home, limit their travels, avoid crowded areas, use contactless greetings and keep away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social separation in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people assembled recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of transmission of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" led to implications that social isolation was necessary completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home self-insulation was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspected that they were infected.
The health agencies issued detailed instructions for adequate self-insulation. Many governments required or recommended self-forty for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions of autoquaren were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals were advised that they may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide-scale transmission that makes 14 days of self-hundredth from the moment of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is performed in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproduction rate below 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. At this, we call "buying the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions which are not of pharmaceutical nature and which may administer outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for the face and self-hundredth; Community measures aimed at physical distancement, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as the cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain outbreaks, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, remained quarantine and travel prohibitions were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines. Moreover, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed the self-hundredth and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those that stocked up medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that reduction (reduction of contact speed, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e., reversal of epidemic growth) present major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce demand by health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overloading health systems.
The suppression may be the best alternative, but it must be maintained while there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this happens before. On the contrary, transmission occurs again as soon as the relaxation of the measurements occurs.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, which include the existing drug test.
The use of medicines for cooling that do not require medical prescription, drinking plenty of fluid and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid.
Using steroids can make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "traditional and home" medications can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat outbreaks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, as well as the increase of intensive care capacities through staff training and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from 1 December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronary coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huanan seafood wholesaler market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The following day, the doctor informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a "coronavirus of the SARS type".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were accused by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was accused by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a statement to the population on 31 December and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled to approximately seven and a half days.
In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre, as well as a main point of rail connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms until January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
Depending on the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home containment orders or lockdowns) and pick-up touches. On 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are in some way confined in the United States, over 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined to South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined to India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. Her hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27th.
Initial genetic tests on 27 December 2019 in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronary virus.
A release to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications took place, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police by "scattering rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the biggest quarantine in the history of humanity", a health cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips to or from Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The commemorations of the Chinese new year, on January 25, were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention and stadium centres. On 26 January, the government launched further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken several measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were carried out in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport has been modified, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
The control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) went through some sort of restriction of exits. After the outbreak entered its global phase, in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers arriving in the city. On March 23, continental China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, by means of a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese premium, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had basically been blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details as to when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., agreeing with the Qingming Festival. However, the central government asked families to pay tributes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of China's COVID-19 to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency of the country reported a significant increase in the cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were placed in quarantine after testing confirm that three soldiers were positive to the virus.
The schedule of the air lines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and most well organized program of the world in terms of screening of the population for the virus. The country also isolated people infected and tracked and placed in quarantine those who contacted them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel by means of a mobile application, test of the virus by drive-thru, with results available on the following day, in addition to the increase in test capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not placed whole cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided on the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions requesting the impeachment of Moon under the allegation of government malmanagement of the outbreak, or raising its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of lower cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing of the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and religious events on Fridays, the closing of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran had five trillion Riyas to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the New Persian Year was continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the midst of claims to cover the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries traced their cases related to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members with positive test for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch strongly requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissidents, as well as temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of virus spread in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the start of the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 current or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
Until March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be alleviated to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of emergence, people's entrances and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sports events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government demanded the total closure of all schools and universities around the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the A Series football matches, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy moved to China as the country with more Coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.

From April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus up to that point may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first arose as one of the weakest in the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending the interruption of all non-essential and social travels, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as quickly as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two persons and restricting outdoor trips and activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersal of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with business exceptions considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and car workshop.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow beginning for the tests, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test was marked by defective testing kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval by the federal government for test kits that were not from the government (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested until the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).

On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic close to the festivities in the new lunar year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that "this was certainly not a recommendation from WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated." On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission among humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as Public Health Emergency International Scope (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO's Director General, Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked due to "the risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that interfere unnecessarily in international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance a strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "have no systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it does arise".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "to invest now or they will have to pay later." On February 11, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated, as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO states will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and developmental context resulting from the outbreak".
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide assistance to international experts and WHO on land in China and to evaluate "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and carry out field visits to evaluate "the impact of response activities on the levels of provinces and municipalities, including urban and rural panoramas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible Coronavirus pandemic", declaring that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should nevertheless establish "a preparatory phase".
In response to an emerging outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global Coronavirus threat would be high from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Agree.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that current data did not authorize public health officers to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned with alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and with alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms, so it was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 thousand people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, tens of United Nations human rights experts stressed respect for each individual's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that each individual has the right to health, including disabled people, minorities, elderly people, people with mental problems, homeless people, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of Coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the United Kingdom's Minister of Cabinet, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators in China's Communist Party Province (CCP) were resigned because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, e.g. Zhao Lijian rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way of diverting the failure in the administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has obtained from a United States government cable a detailed stratagem of communication with apparent origins on the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "That all has to do with China.
We have been advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and TV apparitions. "Channels such as Policy, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy leader, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence struggle through a trendy and 'generous policies' point of view.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending help to those countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks for Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting the aid to other nations to their own country.
And he hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
Turkey has also confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Mayo dispensed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said that "to offer help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a small scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries that are participating, but the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political figures in exercise or ex-politics.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipate that this may adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a forty-two-week place designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions asking for Moon's impeachment in relation to those they have called inadequate emergency management, or commending their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to approve emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been responsible for several cases of shortage of supplies, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The Food and Administration of the United States issued warnings on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the panic-driven shopping event leading to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including scarcity of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also caused delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with WHO's warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, dajiu, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulae for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that has been foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not see a major reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very hit in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
Since Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing centre, viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer image emerged on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of a specialist at Washington University in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is supposed to have been "confounded" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of China Continental.
On 27 February, due to increasing concerns about the outbreak of Coronavirus, several U.S. stock exchange indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed its most significant falls since 2008, with Dow's fall at 1.191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three other indices ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH stated China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many consider a probable economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the effective emergency measures of the central states and banks.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist spots, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the Chinese New Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivals, with private companies closing their shops and tourist attractions independently such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Moon year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in the hours of temporary shops or closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
North American and Middle East resellers observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% fall in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The world-wide Shopping Center operators imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperature, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government help.
The outbreak of Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate may reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid by means of daily pay) unemployed. A research by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some kind of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second 15th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany put their workers under low-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The reduced-time work programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
Performatic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and help artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerated impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the period of the Christian Lent, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home than attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made available the services of the church via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer drive-in style cults.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming locations around the world were closed and face poker tournaments were also postponed or canceled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many great theatres like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live shows or creating online "festives" for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several internet memes about coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidences of fear, mistrust, and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving a fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak in new countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions by pressuring the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan went to the Trending Topics on Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was the target of criticism by referring to coronary virus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from north-east India, who border with China, and students in the big cities of India allegedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unity in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them."
The comments were later condemned by the Consulate of China in Calcutta, who called it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign waste" and targets of "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS - CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronary artery RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
The antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal scrubbing or saliva sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours or 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharynx rubbing is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by suction catheter or material ejected by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as a base for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He is looking for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use from the National Medical Products Administration of China for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for the Crownvirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real-time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests based on failure reagents, and one obstacle to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only from then on the local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories began the tests at the beginning of March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction was announced; sample collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Holgic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the USA and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in particular to the protein of the new coronavirus (nucleocapsidium N protein) is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise".
Typical CT features include bilateral multilobar opacityes in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve according to the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its aspects of image matching with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after symptoms have arisen, to determine immunity, and in the monitoring of the population. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through remote laboratory tests (POC).
High productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although many samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their testing kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
The antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the acquired antibody testing kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong organized a system in which suspected patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result soon afterwards. British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the country's fastest and most comprehensive tests. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Medical Officers stated on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, and 10,700 had been tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: either "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this test capacity did not have an online access.
Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily income was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open-source models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need of robotic handleters for liquids.
In March the shortage or insufficient amounts of reagents became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the genomes of the RNA for additional tests. On March 31, it was released that the United Arab Emirates are now doing more per capita tests in its population for the Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on the way to increasing the level of testing and reaching most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a mass-scale mass processing laboratory of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside China.
Different methods of testing aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method for the manufacture of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests available to the USA and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the testing kits right at the beginning of the outbreak; moreover, these countries with Australia failed to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs such as the best way to delay the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of cottons and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported specific problems in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC showed "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private tests. Spain acquired testing kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results imprecise.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure in sampling or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish minister said that he would cancel the kits that produced incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China have produced wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million testing kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Attas Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the tested kits of Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million testing kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to strongly advise the inhabitants to stay home on March 28, but the schools reopened after the holiday on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests, compared to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptom.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by country testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's shampoo or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, franc or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After snoring your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal discards.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of washing hands is to clean up the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing of hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary heart disease and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in births made at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand-washing can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand-washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to poor areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with the washing of hands with soap. Washing of hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, transforming the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths by diarrhea by almost half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in one room.
Washing of hands is generally associated with other sanitary interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing your hands also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand-washing is that frequent hand-washing can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of peeling and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCT).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (mythion, defecation), after cleaning a child's bubbly (throat) before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand-washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or grinding your nose; after touching animal discards or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A study in 2014 revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index with 97 percent; the United States was close to the average with 77 percent; and China with the lowest index with 23 percent. Several methods for changing behavior currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to inciting hand washing in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deparasitation twice a year, supplemented by daily soap washing, toothbrushing daily with fluoride, is at the centre of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
The water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public aware in terms of health.
So far, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulae may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce microbial load in hands.
A hand hygiene or antiseptic is a non-aqueous basic hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-alcohol-based basic hand hygiene agents (also known as an alcohol-based hand hygiene product, an anti-septic hand hygiene product, or a hand hygienizer) begin to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbon (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moistant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygienizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand hygienizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygienizers are almost totally ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for alcohol-based hands or hygienizers can be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The backs and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their ends are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be washed well, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Control and Disease Prevention recommends hand washing with hand toilets, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the proper washing of the hands unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygienicizers may cause skin drying unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The alcohol drying effect may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand hygiene agents containing emolients caused substantially less irritation and drying in the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand hygiene rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritative contact dermatitis has become an attractive compared to the washing of hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not wipe the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygienizers are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hands hygiene is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based hygienicizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, different from alcohol, which has shown to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Ash or soil can be more effective than pure water, but can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Dry your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem relevant.
Refrain your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rubs for a longer time removes more germs.
Drain well with running water.
Washing in a sink can recontaminate hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, finger and nail areas.
Artificial glazed enamels can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to maintain hydrated hands; dry skin may cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cooking with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to clear a small amount of water in the hands and a soap bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to drying in public bathrooms.
An increasing volume of research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by the paper towel, hand dryers with hot air and the most modern hand dryers with jet air.
After washing and drying hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air outside the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hand dryers with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The towel papers did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with paper towel.
Washing hands with wet wet sheets wipers for hands is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand hygienicisers shall contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates have reduced with their use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to steam and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there is waste under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of hands by these surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate hand washing and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of infections in the bloodstream related to catheters by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the standard of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory conformity is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicine soaps or antimicrobials) confers an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such extermination action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized tools for cleaning under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and forearms up to elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, water in the forearms should not flow into the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterilized towel and the surgical gown is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand-cleaning in the first 20% wash, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted for food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds for each revealed that the wiper of the hands based on alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygienizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and difficult Clostridium spores in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the team's awareness of hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand hygienizers and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for further research on which interventions are more efficient in different health institutions.
In developing countries, soap-washing is considered to be an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for hand-washing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of hand-washing.
For example, in most rural Africa taps for hand-washing near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates may instead be the result of entrenched habits and not of the absence of soap and water.
Incentives and defenses of soap-washing can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and cause a long-term change in behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. One example for promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotional hand-washing campaigns carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The world day for hand-washing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF announced the adoption of an emoji for hand-washing.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand-washing in developing countries in relation to the DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who had just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and health-care-related infections led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to encourage more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "appropriate hand-washing techniques" were hung close to sinks for hand-washing in public bathrooms and in bathrooms of office and airport buildings in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring the reluctance to take responsibility or to be consistent with something.
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary spot, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing anti-ethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleanness", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including the bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and the netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity, and the ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam authorize the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazard controls for the prevention of coronary artery disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and on the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Labour Safety (OSHA), less exposure-risk functions have minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues, for which basic measures for preventing infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or direct contact with people on whom it is not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of COVID-19 contamination, but may be infected due to existing Community transmission or having travelled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public as in schools, working environments of high population density, and in the retail market of large volumes.
The hazard controls for this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation with use of high efficiency air filters, protective coverage and provision of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system workers and necroteroterotheries that are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of generating aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic may have various effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are ill, because they have to take care of other people or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are on demand and the means of purchasing these products (such as making purchases outside peak time or by delivery services or drive-thru.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in health and safety at work to group hazard controls by efficiency.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without relying on the workers' behavior, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or work procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE shall be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, properly adjusted as necessary (e.g. respirators) used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Labour Health and Safety (OSHA), low exposure work has minimal occupational contact with the public and other working colleagues.
Basic measures to prevent recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick and using the respiratory label, including covering the spire and cough, preparing containers for sheets and for common waste, preparing for telework or for shift steps, if necessary, disincentive of the use of tools and equipment of other workers and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and other people at work.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CCD) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relieve other symptoms, and also recommends that disease licensing policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a family member, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people on whom it is not known whether they are patients confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission in the company's locality, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail shops. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic toilets and the installation of a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include incentives for workers to stay at home, replacement of face-to-face meetings by virtual communication, establishment of shift shifts, cancellation of non-essential travel to places with current COVID-19 epidemic, development of communication plans, including a forum to respond to the doubts of workers, provision of training and updated guidance on risk factors and safety practices against COVID-19, training of other workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment, with training, and use of resources, provision of services, and promotion of health care.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolation of the sick person from other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer her a facial mask, or ask the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with cloths when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should use disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for biological waste, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected below. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include deferral of the journey by the patient passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms during the trip.
The ideal is that medical monitoring occurs in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of trips in the field, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a snack, increasing the space between tables, arrival times and more rigid departure, limitation of non-essential visitors and use of a separate place of health care for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged school exemptions can be considered. For law enforcement authorities performing daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers contact individuals suspected of COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of adequate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the containment and disposition of PPE used and for the containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and necroteries as being in high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure functions include drug delivery workers, medical care, laboratories and medical transportation, who are exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests or invasive specimen collection.
Work on high exposure necroterories includes workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some necroterinal scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution for level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particle filtering, approved by NIOSH or superior quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening employees at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, facial protective or protective glasses, surgical vental and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall supply of PPEs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care for patients to enter into a comfortable room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary PPE for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPEs and disstimulating the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

Subject: [Covid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
Date/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to the other.
Its challenges have no precedent, but we know that our best actions work together with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you working colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
The work of you makes this possible, because you keep your workplaces active, pay our coworkers and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
At that meeting, we consider what we believe to be an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and how best to maintain sustainable organization in that period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to stay away for a while, no problem.
For all employees, service providers and employees by contract:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work on the normal schedule, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy supplies or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule would not need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No attestation or paid strike is required. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives the appropriate attention of the management).
Staff who work per hour shall receive the full payment.
We've said that before, and we're committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work for an hour.
They will all receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work file under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate to your manager, so we know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we should continue to perform.
Site Trust Engineering, HR, Trust & Security and Funding (among others) teams perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Deceleration now will not harm us in the future.
We have no intention of "working bent to recover lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impracticable.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces the current workloads of planning and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmed.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Given this situation, by caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entry bag and all lifts that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own care duty protocol using products that are safe for its customers.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to come back.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and with all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings for up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider dividing them in several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and forward material for reading in advance.
Use videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and real-time connection.
Have a leader to facilitate the meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching on ergonomics guides in the context of webinar to assist in increasing remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed subsidy activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep the focus on their own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in that together and we'll help with whatever we need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries significantly affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, do not cease to notify you and work with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations of HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary as support right now, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months after.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family to be in your best condition when needed.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resource team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (AEC) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also works as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a Peptide M2 N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain that carries amino acids and cholesterol in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the domain of transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, enterocytes of the thin intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and muscle smooth arteries in most organs.
The expression of the mRNA of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
The ECA clicates type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2, in turn, phenylalanine of amino acid carboxiterminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis of angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also clemates several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinine, apiline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the transport through the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point in cells for some coronary coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme in endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serina-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing levels of ECA2, in cells, may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolissaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II is in circulation is high. Infused rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to help monitor in response to the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have contacted infected individuals.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy questions were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open-source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was in advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and potential absence of effectiveness if acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple sets limits for types of organizations that can add cronavirus related applications to your App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using cronovirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the cronovirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement asking for limits for this type of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as evidence-protected;
digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalisation;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for by law;
safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse should exist;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health specialists and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potential problems of considerable privacy.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a series of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application based system was used to run contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate warnings via text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to comprehensive changes to the information confidentiality laws after the emergence of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralised system.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to, at least, 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the proximity of one user to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include the Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never comes out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location or crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research from the technical publication "Applicatives play dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the Enigma MPC, a commitment that develops privacy technologies and originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of generalized adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, became open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow the government to create official conavirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by running system updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposing, reperfilation, redistribution or therapeutic replacement) is the reproposing of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugs, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable development project of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trials process and is only authorised by the EUA as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when there's no other option.
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipyravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to base the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japanese medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration about buying the medicine. The medicine can be less effective in severe cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by connecting with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to reprove specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after the remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against wire, pneumonia, paramixus, and coronary coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more severe transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and seriously ill people with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The aim is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited among the serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Currently, researchers from the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are breast-feeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods were not included in the tests.
Various anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study with 300 patients is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14, Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to approved and developed antiviral drugs for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary artery disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical tests completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that caused the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five candidates for the vaccine were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a great spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists reported 10 platforms of diverse technologies being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (developer in phase I and candidate for vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidates for vaccine are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being planned).
A phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter-controlled, while at the same time determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing the disease while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in humans (still in pre-clinical research).
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the start of the work in a vaccine, with the goal of testing humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developed an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner in Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immmuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "in the next 90 days."

On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring Spring, both in the western region of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
By March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for the vaccine is researched in the laboratory, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine together.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have pre-clinical testing results in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could start for human tests in autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Preparedness for Epidemic (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of ECPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to 29 million dollars.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, health authorities in Russia announced that scientists began testing on animals of six different candidates for the vaccine.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-ampplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of China's sequencing.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccine in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other Coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines from the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that triggered powerful responses from specific antibodies to antigens [in rats] that were evident that started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A randomized posterior test in Australia is seeking to register 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific to COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for containment measures for level 3 biosafety to manipulate live viruses, and an international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in copies of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
From March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (DNA-based) which concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are vaccines vectorized by viruses, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
The disease by Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The exposure time up to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
From 17 April 2020 more than 2,24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through drops produced by cough, spir or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious in long distances.
People may also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reaction in the chain of real-time reverse transcription polymerase (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Virus-infected patients may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty staying awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sliding nose or throat pain may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function these asymptomatics perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking high frees more drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people's rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by the air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, although it is not fully clear how easy the disease is to spread, a person normally infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day on paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the initiation of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the higher viral load, while the sixth patient presented the higher viral load on the second day tested.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus that was first isolated in three patients with pneumonia who had a relationship with a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately connected to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells by means of the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to IOCID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, it has been demonstrated that the pathogenic T cells that secretate GM-CSF are correlated with the recruitment of secretory inflammatory monocites of IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in necropsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample can be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish their genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, testing through antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) was under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing showed that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar dark glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (Lobular septs thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available regarding microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffused intravascular coagulation (CID); leukerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a coughing or sneezing scarf, as well as cover the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the sheet is not available.
The appropriate hygiene of the hand after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
Distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective drug for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to decrease the peak of the epidemic, also known as "purchase of the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after grinding their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends to use antiseptic for hands based on alcohol with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where antiseptics for commercial hands are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "a substance active for aseptic hands".
Glycerol is added as moisturizer.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. Intensive Doctors and Pneumologists gathered recommendations for treatment of various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
It is necessary to take precautions to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being performed that can generate aerosols such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, respirator or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but FDA authorised masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-described uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure on two levels.
If either of them brings the same benefits to people who are seriously ill, you don't know.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits that aerosol particles spread, when compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in elderly people (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have per capita hospital beds in sufficient quantity, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of cases of COVID-19 serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are necessary to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High PEEP level may not be available in older fans.
The research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical tests are being performed with several antiviral medicines.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the medicines tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the tests of effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorisation for the use of plasma of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses of mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorised the security agencies to track mobile telephone data of persons who are allegedly with coronary virus.
The measure has been taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to research and prevent virus transmission.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who is responsible for quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by cell operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hack at the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's president Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but there are no data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of those hospitalized in hospitals with COVID-19, while renal impairment was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Cytopathotic viral changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image examination looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, damage was detected in the heart due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates by comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-notification of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or to die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This may also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronary coronaviruses, but cases were reported in which COVID-19 recovery was followed by positive coronary coronary virus tests at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin by means of transhipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but since December 2019, the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission to humans.
A study with the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of the onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of the onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the mortality rate per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals dying of a disease, and the lethality rate for infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and accompany a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had the death by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50-year-old range, with the difference between men and women only approaching 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of female smokers and development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on gender-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is of "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is since the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus causing COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Koronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal zaragogas and respiratory parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the next.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, incorrect information and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study was unable to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine was approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein of the spicule that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmlessly copied genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 clinical tests have been underway since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists of most Chinese research, with nine clinical tests in phase III of remdesivir in several countries due to an end-April report.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of candidates for medicine and vaccine for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with rembesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being performed in the USA, China and Italy. The chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a joint review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although it recommends a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to the criteria of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be more studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial spicle in preparation for serum 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have large limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be a complication in the posterior stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine timestade properties. Tocilzumabe was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized phase 2 test is under way in Italy after it has shown positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected that neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of the death of some affected people.
The interleucin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of cytokine-refractory steroid-induced cytokine-free syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumabe is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, e.g. using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are developing.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disorders, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
