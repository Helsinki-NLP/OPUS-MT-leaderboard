. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown at the top, with pale or carotenoid colouring at the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information on the evolution of the feathers of the birds.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachid, but has other typical characteristics of feathers, beards and beards, researchers have concluded that the rachid is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.

Huhne resigned and was replaced by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for businesses left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the magistrates' court in Westminster is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider must undergo a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon didn't explode when it was pointed to the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from an eye, he lacks a skull section and his face has been rebuilt in titanium.
Schneider testified through video conference from a USF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two individual championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race he participated in, the giant slalom, saw him ranked tenth in the female group of the category "sedati", with a time of combined journey of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four women's skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants at the Slalom Giant did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her cell phone and her laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with a covered face.
None of the three people who were at home at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the Red TT Audi.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital of Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the court of the sheriff of Edinburgh with the charge that he killed his own son.
She is detained pending referral to trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eye witness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters. In fact, the Scottish courts have considered the publication of photos potentially detrimental.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on an open terrain".
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has specified to journalists that no new comments will be issued until at least the formal indictment.
According to the above mentioned, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, that Palestine wants to be based on existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other topics dealt with include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the association Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the association Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth interim electoral council in Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country into new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee has set up Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which started in October, which are challenging the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the failure to conduct the elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused mild burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its reply, the ministry called the postponement of the report by Apple "absolutely impermissible".
The earthquake at Marianne was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Marianne Islands, no damage was reported to the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took hostage Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 Rolando Mendoza rifle he set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elders, were released immediately with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins went through his father's footsteps and took up his doctor's career.
After he was trained in the hostess, he began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in leisure time Liggins began studying cases of premature work.
His research showed that administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His wrestling colleagues also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Mona was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, exactly like you. A strong woman."
"The moon was as strange as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... we hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted over 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to Australia's transition to the Republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the Acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents argue that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% feel that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have won in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three staff at the Commonwealth Games, but it accused several disturbances that led to doubt its physical form.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer teacher at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known until today.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter on earth, that is, matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how the planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, having been clashed with comets a long time ago.
Como, 53 years old, has been in charge since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he has put his signature on a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing more than "tricks and political idiots."
A candidate for the presidency is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to drivers.
Additional transport is not being arranged and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, while car parking or interchange parking is not available on site.
Fears related to the absence of the means of transport have revealed the possibility of having the game fought compulsoryly at closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was considered that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic fringe of Darwin, strong Geospiza, and the fringuel of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirotristris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and intertwined. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand painted images in books called "miniated codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color according to whether the chemical element is acid or basic (alkaline).
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH H letter).
Hydrogen ions mean protons whose electrons have been extracted (as hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean hands and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, remains of sewer nets have been discovered in the houses of the Minoic towns of Crete and Santorini.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public baths, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone away thousands of miles, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was made with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visual.
To carry in space a satellite or telescope is necessary a high rocket more than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to provide us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium sized felines that feed on medium sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline (including free domestic cats) that feed on small preys, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The niche concept is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every cat has and which allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social feline and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 intertwined, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Women are usually closely intertwined with each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The herd of lions acts in a very similar way to the flock of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is indeed surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other great feline), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a tensile force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four feline are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
The birds like to feed small animals. If possible, they go hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all prey that catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the birds follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, watering on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the birds mingle with the surrounding environment and then plunge them over.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population to which it belongs (e.g. if you move beyond a mountain chain or a river, or move on a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment other than the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passing of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it increasingly resembles less and less to the other population.
At one point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different between them that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide from them (through inspiration).
Plants develop their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce our clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants the animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his age and therefore feared nothing, except the other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws there were more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for whoever crossed its path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it may have the biforked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not have competed with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for various strange or unusual ranges, such as boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women were eating while sitting on chairs, rich men loved to banquet together while lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
For every god the Babylonians built a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests were trying to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary only accessible to the priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built that became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor benches overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red gave her name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes lived there.
Although all countries are "scandinavian", the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the film "The Mystery of the Temples", you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Although on the back of the document there is something written, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of original independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down to the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the wide parchment document (measure 29.75 inches per 24.5 inches) has been rolled to be restored.
Probably, then, the annotation was only affixed as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded South France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragonon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
With civilization it is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, making up a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civilis", that is to say citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a way also defines the dimensions of society.
The cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces, thus not being recognized as true and own civilization.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, it was entrusted to the State authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of their acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax and duty laws between states.
In order to change the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was needed, and they had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports there are: football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey on track and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and they see Italians engaged in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, we refer to Japan as a "archipelago", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing there gradually registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Eastern Indies Dutch Company in 1624 established a foundation in the south-west part of Taiwan, beginning a transformation that concerned the production systems of aboriginal cereals and taking Chinese arms to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus giving up Taiwan's sovereignty in Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, and in particular the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration works are still under way.
The most common format in the world for photographing fixed images, for example, is the 35 mm, the same as the film most used on the end of the analog photography era.
It still occurs today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the formats of image sensors of digital cameras.
Strangely enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing for twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the formed municipalities (for example the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The often exploited third-party rule is a simple driving line that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, became under examination.
Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite language and costume differences.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to launch a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proved effective: it envisaged the interruption of any essential military and civil supply, despite this blockade that violated international law usually accepted and codified by many international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters to prevent access of any vessel to entire sections of the ocean and also put neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and efferats of the first world war, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his previous work manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or any family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynastys were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, fierce wars were waged among many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all men candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since military classifications, rather than class-based, are now based on calibre.
The French Revolution has also been a source of inspiration for many other workers oppressed in various countries to start their own revolution.
Maometto had a deep interest in issues that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave lies on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if there was knowledge of it. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large number of mountains around it. From within the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has arrived today not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of Kings in Egypt, hosts numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), various smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arranged up" looks like a V and the indication "arranged down" to a graffiti or a square without the lower side.
Towards the top means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc results in a stronger and more determined sound.
You may decide to add your custom pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archery you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women in the forced market King Louis XVI, in prey to terror, left Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Mary Antonietta, to their two young children (Hary Teresa, 11 years old and Louis Carlo, 4 years old) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep loose the windows of their carriage.
At some point someone among the crowd showed the frightened queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds oscillated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the huge profits resulting from the exploitation protracted in the time of the Philippine people constituted profits at the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Temples you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period when events took place is commonly called the Upper Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII century (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which concluded by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or from technological imperative to the narrow sense that the fate of man is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily leads to a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a greater percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new relief techniques for the care of wounded persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over the course of time, customs and culture related to this geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a neural centre of luxury began around 400 AD and continued about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century his prestige was diminished, especially because the Crusades returned carrying gifts like silk and spices, which were evaluated more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was influenced by the strong influence of eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slow pace of communication makes it possible for the spread of styles in the West to be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crosses, was the introduction of the buttons to tie up the clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Sustainability farming is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining maximum from crops.
Historically most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, which do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manner and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialisation is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, as a result of misfortune, or because of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their parents themselves): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children could have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning even simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, the more help for those who undertake a new learning experience, as can be the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the little assistant in the form of Microsoft Office graffiti.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and have the purpose of questioning, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling alone.
Children are given in trust for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee nourishment, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to meet all the needs not met in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratification.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relations".
The use of video recording has enabled significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements of a few milliseconds' duration.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks explained how people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even maintains that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century the research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is removed from the expressed variability pool.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backwards between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive apparatus similar to that of human beings it is difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids with the plant resources available in savanna.
Moreover, failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and vegetables, but for primates like us are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors themselves have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as they do today's savanna chimpanzees.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by sleep recovery (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to lead you to a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If I decide to reset the clock to sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorithm provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force themselves to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive is the existing vital force. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and settlement.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is hampered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love course of the Mahayan rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-inclusive way of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of lighting) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, system conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the breakup between the two countries.
After two years since the end of the war, once allies had become enemies; so began the Cold War.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for by mercenaries, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken down; the only option was to beat in retreat and reorganize along the head of the Romanian bridge.
These plans, however, were immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army moved forward and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods through the oceans.
It has always been the task of the marines to guarantee the country the preservation of its ability to move people and goods, contrasting at the same time the ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is represented by the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods through the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German military navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated on Zagros mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of ancient times to have milk, wool, meat and skin readily available.
The domestic goats were usually raised in mangroves left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like the shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These pastoral methods are still used today.
In the 16th century, the wagons were built in England.
Although they were simply formed by parallel wooden axes, the wagons, if compared to the slightly more injured roads of the period, allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively soon to keep track in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had at the top an iron bar.
It became a common practice, even though iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place for those in iron. In 1767 they made their appearance the first rails completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Human beings began walking in erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "man erect").
His predecessor, the australopian, did not walk normally erect.
Specialization signs for bipeding are present in the fossils of Australopieco dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this works only as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a draft handwritten signed by the President of the John Hancock Congress and by Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's typography a few blocks away.
The night was produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on 8 July in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the commission was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made her read to her room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 dunlap borders still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to regard them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that combine them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scales and claws, lay their eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that it makes an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a container of medicinal products or open chemicals.
Check whether there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term mites is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted themselves to become man's parasites.
Both killer monkeys and bedbugs are nestless, that is, adapted to live in their nest or in their guest's home.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has recorded about 400,000 known cases, placing first among neurological diseases affecting young people and adults of middle age.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or that of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their children.
In one adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But this is not only about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend in a decisive way on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, compared to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a battery.
They have performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophagus with radioactive sulphur.
The mutations may have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and depending on whether the cells concerned belong to the germination line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism brings people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo's oranges.
Every morning, people leave small country to go to work by car, crossing other people whose place of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic, everyone is somehow linked to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time supports.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, almost all of which complain.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or bridges falling into ruins.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they thrown away every day? Are engineers planning them to be incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic Flow" (i.e. "trafficking flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to the other and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generally mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to stand out for the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to the enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold the wings along the body.
This enables them to exploit a greater variety of small enfractures to hide from predators.
Among all existing insects today, the only ones who are unable to fold the wings are the dragonfly and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone he was right, but many others believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and the second longest river on Earth. It carries a water quantity equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that at some points reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that is poured from the rivers of the planet in the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main river Rio delle Amazoni is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). In it the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries are poured.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, Giza's pyramids were never exceeded in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is made up of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more to the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a temper.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a core with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission pump.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a little push or nothing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the surface lava climb.
Content theories focus on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what is involved in some people and lead them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most widespread content are the Theory of Maslow's needs hierarchy and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, when managers begin to run their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put into practice disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
To the extreme opposite, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire operation of the team and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to differences between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, since meetings can take place according to the various time zones, which may not be included by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" ( Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a key element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to deal with the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organisational learning can be innovation.
When you are able to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the collaboration path within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organization to be innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. The research area becomes more restricted and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the basis of scientific research.
It has long been known that some types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can influence behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fictional connotation, IA represents a very important piece of information technology that deals with machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research on IA includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require smart behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocals and facials.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various applications software for home computers and video games.
The tours represent a fundamental part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing experiences and reflections of travel with future classes.
For example, every year Bennet School students, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, their first experiences with blogs are often characterized by an uncaring grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of a public changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgment the author of the blog commits to improving writing.
Blogs also "require students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop the learning of students well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's suggestive and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and uncontaminated beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the views of foreigners.
The widest areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost unsatisfied wildlands.
If a comparison is made of the population, the result can be surprising to many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the Arab lands the Arabs also took Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by Sahel, while to the south and west borders with the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: It is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of the actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one of too expensive appearance).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, gripped by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenidi.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of White House, which they left in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the most interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, norghilè and a lot of chicancaglierie, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano lava destroyed Goma, burying most of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a wedding-boat (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuttu" ended up becoming an exotic and distant metaphor for land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabizing touch than African, the city stands out clearly from the other parts of the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support to a different wild fauna.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry into the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, since it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by Victoria Harbour waters.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the land that has been enriched on the north coast, densely populated.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point from which to go.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared the heritage of humanity by UNESCO. The forest part included in Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps: in them is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild fauna; in the area there are estimated to be 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 mucked deer.
Buses start from the interdepartmental bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since bus services between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust Japanese small buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a paved bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tralices have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two wide lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to the traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-made hunters and they also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who lived on hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Indie Province", was born in the 16th century since the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches even at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the sterling of the Falklands (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of British sterling (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that they will not accept credit cards on peripheral islands, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check beforehand with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency out of the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below that marked by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "pious" seasons defined: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/m from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/m from all other wild animals.
No matter how sweet it may seem: bees, hazelnuts, deers, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they do not maintain an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Keep in mind also that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odours, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there occurred the sadly known naval stable of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 US and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the trees of pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitetata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops. You can take the bathroom safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You may have many French wines, but those Australians and New Zealanders could better face the journey.
The water of the local tap is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, the bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. The 'express' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (non foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions to the coral barrier and accidents for one of these causes on the coral barrier are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, stick to directions and pay particular attention to security warnings.
The cubeduces appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can only find occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep themselves away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he has reached his destination.
Travel agencies often conclude conventions with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer breakfast packages, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combined packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted before the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some musical festivals, most participants decide to camp on the ground, considering this as a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive soon and get a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stage, there may be sections of the festival in which the music spreads until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the ice crossing causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted exemption from visa requirement (check conditions).
Usually, casinos do everything to increase as much time and money as possible spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of the guests high so that they stay.
In some places alcoholic drinks are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On frozen and snowy carts, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in a very short time it can fall so much snow to keep you trapped.
Precipitation and snow reefs, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, may also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out by land, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so it is sufficient to have a normal equipment to get a good visual.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful, and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with the binocular.
A safari walk (also called "bush walk", "walking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. In fact, the first Olympics had been held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however, most of the coronavirus cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not reach until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 and 130,000, while the normal tickets will cost around 7,000.
Drying wet clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer the use of iron and iron boards, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear skimmed socks, you can try with a hairdryer if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The efficiency of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged within sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not common in their regions of origin.
Pesticides may damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as the transmission of poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers headed to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country streets, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as they predominate steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile telephone service is much higher than that found in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria more south.
Fruit sweets are a classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German bakery cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Most popular cakes are often very well accompanied by a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste sweets small but rich in taste can focus on those who, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
The curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be presented both "dry" and "wet" according to the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the regions of the country, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more widely used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the Indonesian cuisine term is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally indicates food originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of simple dishes of preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Japanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffs are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present security problems for the possibility that the rider's feet will remain stuck.
If a child is tossed by a horse but has a foot stuck in the staff, it could be dragged by the horse that runs. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which make it possible for a leather staff to pull off the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are huge walls and granite cliffs.
Peak peaks include breathtaking views. Scalators from every part of the world continuously trace new paths on its walls, potentially infinite.
The snow sports on the free descent, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide for the snow slide thanks to the use of skis or snowboarding attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (the ski flairs), which devote whole vacation periods to ski activity in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans who ski date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-track, ski mountaineering or skiing on skis.
It is connected, although it usually does not understand them, touring skiing or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much more rigid skiing and boots.
Think of the ski track as a path similar to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances in some way greater than those you walk, but only very rarely will you reach the ski speeds of the background without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries it would be necessary to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area works rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a product an antique piece. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar objects produced in series.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of subsistence for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also at the base of many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi were always involved in large-scale reindeer farming; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many Sámi perform modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roman people, the word "single" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a passenger warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in the event of cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but bear in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations different from Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
"Averse weather conditions" is the general expression indicating any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social damage or loss of lives.
In every part of the world extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types of weather conditions, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, precipitation above the norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to temporal, tornado, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are the torments, the snow bubbles, the ice storms and the sand storms.
It is recommended that travellers be informed about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect the planning of the trip.
Any plans to visit a potentially considerable country as a war zone must support vocational training.
Researching the Internet 'Course on Hostile Environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers who are planning a surgery to change sex abroad must ensure that they have the documents valid for the return trip with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no indication of sex (X) or updated documents to match a name and a desired type is variable.
Similarly variable is the availability of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Safety checks have also become much more stringent in the post-September 11, 2001.
Transgenders in the pre-operative phase must not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The currents of risacca are composed of the flow of return of the waves that break onto the beach, often near a coral barrier or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths occur due to fatigue in the attempt to swim countercurrent, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, going back to swimming won't be harder than normal.
Try to find an area where you don't risk being trapped again, or evaluate whether to wait for the rescue, according to your skills and if you've been notified.
The shock to return occurs in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a shorter " honeymoon"), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
When you return home after having lived abroad, you will be adapted to the new culture and you will have lost some of the uses of your original culture.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely that you have met people who are patient and understanding, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning to their homeland.
The show of pyramid sounds and lights is the most interesting in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always feel the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the background and storyteller of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of a still active volcano is filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the highlands, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth mountains, a chain of 360 km cut into two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as Sentinella Catena, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massiccio, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only alternative.
A satellite phone does not usually constitute a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you have to find yourself outdoors with the visual scraping up to the satellite.
The service is often used by sports boats, including sports boats, as well as missions that need data and distance voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
One of the most popular options among those who plan to take a Sabbath year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among neodiplomates, since they can take a year before they start university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a foreign course in the Sabbath year can actually increase the possibility of taking up higher education than returning to their country of origin.
The registration of these educational programmes usually requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Terra dei thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
The nautical is Finland's national pastime, where you count a boat every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for two whole days, going back to the ship at night to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for the descent to the ground (from 2009 onwards) using the excursions on board.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, besides the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flew before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people to understand how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or the lack of control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get him to get there faster would be to send him as a stock baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to send him luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay off a good number for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for travel to Business and up to eleven times the rate for those in the first class!
In general, on flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Air carriers are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at destination, and consequently apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very popular.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the theater of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is that Christian-Orthodox.
Smirne is the third city of Turkey by size, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smirne develops on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping centre.
Although in the city you breathe an atmosphere more like that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide streets, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are lined by the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the 18th century market and mosques and ancient churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the church sanctuary, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
About half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 line bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Always north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), place of famous Marian apparitions around the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common pit, and has an almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world’s population.
There are still many surviving men and women in these places, and many others who have seen their own beloved murders or made to work until death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid beatings on the holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by embracing structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known almost by everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Possible interruptions of unscheduled service are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are famous for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be to behave at best, relating as a "well-high" person (well-educated). This will greatly facilitate your movements.
The rough outward appearance of Parisians will fade quickly if you get rid of some good basic ways.
The National Park of Plitvice Lakes is rich in forests, mostly beech, fish and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, there is a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also houses a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places there live rare species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar cock, next to several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries make available the stylus for the women who get ready, but if you already have one, especially in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts might not feel at your ease. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorine cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa with Oli is a simple popular dinner typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei", always begin with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing quite complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most of the words are spoken as it is written.
The main letters to be paid attention are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce differently "r" and "rr": dear means blessed, while carriage means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and more often regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in the understanding of phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Roman language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can reach the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore must not be studied separately.
Today, premodern observers are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most of the modern telescopes for research are huge structures in scattered areas where the weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept was originally from China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherries were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to even take a "only" example.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-turn city; you can buy almost anything once you have arrived.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to make the accounts with the hot (always) and the strong sun (s seldom, when the sky is quiet).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland watercourses can be an excellent theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can make a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of hiking trails and well-known cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions linked to this holiday have also been adopted by unbelievers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition plans to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an open place to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could well be a pre - Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches a Easter vigil is celebrated on Saturday night of Easter weekend, with the congregations that often start the ceremony at midnight to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands reached us by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals were unable to cope with the journey. This led the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats have been introduced to the Galapagos.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun stays under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to watch the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution often does not pose a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be used to.
The office clothing is normally made up of jackets and ties or sizeur and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
The harmonization of the workplace is of crucial importance, because it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than to commend individual achievements.
Workers should often receive the blessing of their superiors on every decision, and they are expected to comply with the instructions without asking questions.
