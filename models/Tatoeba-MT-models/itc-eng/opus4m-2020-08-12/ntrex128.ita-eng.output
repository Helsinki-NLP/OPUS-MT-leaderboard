The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned to "figure the clowns"
The proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales) is seen as an embarrassment among some members of the House.
This proposal is a consequence of the programmes to amend the name of the assembly in Parliament of Wales.
The members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "he can row with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means cretin and pwp means poach.
One member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" to change the name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is rendered in a similar way to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drafting amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what will be called the members of the House will of course be a subject of debate for the members themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which has given ample support to the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales Assembly.
As regards the title of the members of the House, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a gratification for President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedons go to the polls for the referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to put an end to an ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece for decades, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a opposer of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said he would not take into account the result of the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are closed while the churches of Harlem are in difficulty
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"There's none of them today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will hasten the time when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by brothers before Harlem became a black district - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the head of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the 125th street dealers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of colour.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon at the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concerns that the diocese "seeked to download costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark wounds a thirteen-year-old lobster fishing dive in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was immersing himself in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV of San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him with a group of people to take him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was just enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was crying 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His whole clavicle was laced," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the hospital Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted under critical conditions.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper chest area.
The authorities banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a boost to the beauty products sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive towards the UK’s UK pound 2.8 billion beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in the fashion and household articles sectors decrease, the largest beauty products corridors will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in several shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of items for beauty up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - an increasingly required quality by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a move towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the sales outlets will increasingly resemble large warehouses while the chain of supermarkets tries to oppose discount resistance such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has given impetus to food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restore enamel to its departments of beauty and pharmaceutical products ended up in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended up in a dispute about the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business three years ago at Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of a wide range of luxury brands of skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every requirement and inviting environment and convenient positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furiously" after Holly Willoughby shows up from an agreement of 11 million pounds
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract with her trend mark to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of housewives and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after having withdrawn from their profitable trend brand activity at the last minute to focus on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "sniff" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth 1.5 million pounds - did not leave her enough time to dedicate to their brand of housewives and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it had been calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated around £11 million.
As soon as the 37-year-old Willoughby chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It had to be its long-term future that would have engaged her for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved completely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters of Marlow, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and because of possible delays to the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the "I'm A Celebrity" ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telejournal conductor".
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was acclaimed by Trump as an enormous step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearisation are at a point of death.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he stressed, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are getting great results," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravages an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether the international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The evident lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put at the heart of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesian brand infrastructures and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands moved away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is paired against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at the 89th minute on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 meters from the Chelsea gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before he pulled on the second pole.
The attempt went high above the frame of the door as it turned to the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and ransacked into the network.
"It was enough to try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I got a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Blue centerers went from heel to Mateo Kovacic before sliding away near the middle camp and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick transition to the middle of the field.
So he carried out a beautiful passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left goal beyond Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round phase of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at St. Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15.00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters declared Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported trapped in the masonry of the buildings collapsed following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 metres high, reported the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been ravaged by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police have invited people who might have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning but I would like to make an appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on Dashcam, to contact us because he could have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the finding this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible."
At 14:00 two police vans were located inside the delimited area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were within the delimited area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information on this subject is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument struck by the wave of "write of history"
His departure would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England performed by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follia" and an "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty during British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still consider to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
That is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the 17th century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer pig strips a Chinese farmer killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China according to local media news.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered with blood near a pig to the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pig vaccines at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province in China.
He reported that he had traveled with his cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said that in the pig there was a big male pig with blood on his nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-kg pig had cleared the farmer, according to the declarations.
"The legs of my cousin were covered with blood and macillate," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the farmer.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a male pig of 300 kg nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're funny, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The skyscrapers of the hurricane Rosa will bring vast rains in the south-west of the USA
As expected, the Rosa hurricane is losing power as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on North Mexico and on the South-West coast of the USA in the next few days.
Rosa recorded up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
Thus, tropical humidity in contact with the approaching sack will create heavy and vast rainfall in the south-west area in the next few days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, streams of debris and possible streams in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in the areas of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the south-west, particularly in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods may occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make the river canyons full and the storms will bring the wind to blows and raise dust.
The approaching sack will cause strong local rains on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery carts.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before the rains become wider at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will descend on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations of temperatures on the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain warm enough.
This sometimes leads to important temperature variations over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in the Central USA will be registered on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected to start in October for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 °C from Southern Plains to the north-east.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate a strong probability of temperatures above the average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the successful deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have happened in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with the broadcasters interrupting the regular programming for a last-minute event on Friday: an agreement designed by the senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in a state of drunkenness and tried to strip her off during a party at the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflammated deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it's a hearing similar to that for a football game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the whole day's hearing, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement stating that it would have voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken back by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He kept his eyes low for several minutes while being rebuked and live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and declared, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say during the hearing of the committee.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's appointment to the whole Senate for one vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have had the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump started an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicalizing" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused those who criticize his programmes of letting the European Union "political face" with the future of Britain and of jeopardizing national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that Britain and the EU have to collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest the suspect of the death of the player LSU Dyteon Simpson
Police arrested a suspect from Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder, declared Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated to the CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The security was set at $350,000, the lawyer informed.
East Baton Rouge's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the State of Louisiana, the police scientist's lab, the Southern University police and the local citizens who provided assistance to the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU's athletic director thanked the zone order forces for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 bounces per game.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "disturbed" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Volcano cosparges ash Mexico City
The ashes coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and there had been 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rhombs and shocks.
Images on the social media have shown subtle layers of ashes covering the windshield of cars in Mexico City as Xochimilc.
Geophysicals have seen an increase in activity corresponding to the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) to the south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the demonstrators pro-independence clashed with police riot squads and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the anti-sommose police targeted the cops with eggs and threw powder paint, creating cloud clouds of dust in the streets that usually engulf tourists.
Further fighting took place during the day with police officers who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted with the demonstrators of unionists who cried "Long life in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to be treated for mild injuries during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx had been low, and the Catalans against secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police had tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place at seats throughout the region.
The independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he had no hope of the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy for the ability to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory even though it was measured at the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protest with his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after the explosion of a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a ballast at some point.
The attack of Menga marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the victory
The previously promoted Livingston has left the Rangers astonished by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the club of Ibox.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore left without a win outside home in the Premiership this season and will have to face the first ones in the Hearts ranking next Sunday, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston continues its series of victories in the division remaining in battle for six games, with Coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage long before the goal, with their immediateness that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson found out but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he joined to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put the visitors in trouble with pitches.
And so it was that the crucial goal was realized.
The Rangers granted a kick of punishment and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to move to Menga, which was able to mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession of ball but the host team's defense had proved impenetrable and the doorkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the feet of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's doorkeeper shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The cross has succeeded in the Livingston area and have been continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigour, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for failure of hand, have been refused.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their game style and employees have changed very little from their return to the maximum series, but you have to give much credit to Holt for the way he knew how to spray the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, head of a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they have fallen well below these standards.
The last step has been missed - only once have they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are in half rank.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
This was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at distancing relations between NATO allies.
There have been discussions on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population group outside Turkey.
The police motivated the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in conflict with a car
A cyclist died in a fight with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic road of Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident took place on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been blocked and diverted by buses and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards wounded during a disorder
Six prison guards were wounded during a riot in the male prison with maximum security, reported to the prison office.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin's male security prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still in progress.
Specialized agents "Tornado" were used to manage the riot, involving eight prisoners and confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on site for mild facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "Personally formed prison was deployed to contain an incident currently under way in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-sommosa agents were called to intervene in prison to provoke a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (of which areas affected by drought may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to strike Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of the hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden floods.
The national weather service has already issued sudden floods by Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly on Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The national weather service of Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for hurricanes provide precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including central rocky mountains and Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of these rainfalls will probably be positive as the south-west zone is currently experiencing a drought period.
According to the drought monitoring centre, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
Initially the path of the hurricane Rosa will reach the land through the peninsula of the Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will clash with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect rainfall between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, to then head through the Arizona and towards the southern Utah on late Tuesday night.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or by its debris is intense precipitation in Baja California, the north-west area of Sonora and the south-west desert zone of the USA," the National Center for Hurricanes reported.
These rains are expected to generate potentially lethal floods and streams of debris in the deserts, as well as mills on mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in the Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the area Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have taken over with the telephone what has happened.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered for evil and anger" of the democratic party during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh filed before the Congress on Thursday, denying passionately and decided the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified to the hearing defending himself from the prosecution.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people could observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced minds of the law of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented record in public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the republican influx to the midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting hard for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first fundamental procedural vote to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place not later than Friday, according to which the CNN told a senior assistant to the GOP management.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when high waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, turning into victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian agency for disaster control BNPB.
"The tsunami not only came, dragged cars, logs, houses, hit anything on the mainland," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency have shown numerous buildings and shops destroyed, counted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The siege continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the heavy earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dojaga, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Dojaka, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one feels a man on a top floor of a building crying agitated way to warn people about the coming tsunami on the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced persons still need food and other goods of first necessity.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget of the tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although World Vision staff in Dojaga managed to reach the city of Palu in good health, where employees took refuge under shelters of waxed canvas in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"I've been told that I've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while relief groups have begun the difficult start-up operations of rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescuers with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations establish that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can start to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, the friends and relatives of the dispersal still held the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was taken from a discharge.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the preparer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the dispersed paragliding pilots.
Other people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandage, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the contestants of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of gray output rather than two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 during a bank transfer to Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a ATM in the fun center and preparing to deliver another money, said investigator Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "runs behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects who escaped the crime scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our evilness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without strokes and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements on the left were taking foot throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double the funds devoted to research in this field, says IA Kai-Fu Lee's investor and operator, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various groups of the US government on AI, although in the USA in general there is a lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: China plans to be the country No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Redouble the budget in IA research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in IA," said Lee.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector would be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American player of Otello with the highest score and later was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous technological competitions of the US government such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when to hold the next one, to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work a lot to get money from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the leaders out of the academic field, it's the multinationals," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee stated that changes to immigration policy could help the USA to boost its efforts under AI.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organisations distribute funds to researchers in the USA, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities and the White House has announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the US order to set up a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of the country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbours' name constitutes a claim on its territory and has placed the veto at Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents believe that change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he will not vote at the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the influx will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum sheet is as follows: "It agrees with accession to NATO and the EU and with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority.
The State Election Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the influx was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters had voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the Macedonia referendum for the change of name of the country that would open the door to membership of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and settling his chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to head high, not for the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that accession to NATO will lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confident of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of the voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required influence.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be valid, the influx must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the West-Filo-Government since it was established in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 match from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy his point marked at 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a move to half-field at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated a defender before going beyond several others to the limit of the Brighton area.
So he made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the doorman of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a right shot in the network.
"Aguero is having problems on his feet," told the reporters, the coach of the City, Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to score at that time."
But it was Sterling that initially brought the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came to 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the net ball just before leaving the field.
The City will fight against Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Joker wants to play dirty against Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least one catch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why should I never want to compete?"
Nationals still have to announce a first launcher per Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let it be Scherzer to launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, performed a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal Sunday of rest.
The launcher of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump to a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the influx of republicans during the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really doing what I'm doing for this, I fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Let's see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see evil, evil.
They don't care who can hit them, who have to interfere to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it's been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wrong, mean, mean and liars."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, unleashing strong fissures among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you trap the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uhm no, I expect one - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He doesn't tolerate people who say what they think
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been reported not to be welcomed, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if never remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an inversion of tendency on my part and who took positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public - and it does not really matter what I say - they follow involuntary insults on social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because comments to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist or racist background insults every day but who are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the rules of selection, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given many advice, inviting me to lower the boss, not to express my views so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But it's not to do this that I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the incuracy of the Thatcher government that had left my class of secondary school literally falling apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way disturbed by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm the family nuclei, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr hit the scale
Two late attempts might in some way have unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr has earned the triumph in this exceptionally funny game of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the ranking, the only team in 10.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their boldness, who pushed the house team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still in a fight, so I have to be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr's merit must be recognized, they have better exploited the opportunities of us."
Grant Anderson's goal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow sign for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor before, just in half time, to mark and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose started well the second time and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There has therefore been a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which has been spread, and at the start, the Ayr is rebounded in advantage thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The Captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow sign and Melrose made the man pay more with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the house team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson marked a down touch behind the Ayr advanced mix.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had collected football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the house team.
Still Game Star is looking for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after finding out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Actor 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he writes and plays with the long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking of a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make statements, although a source of Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "proper food trade."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia without an outlet on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path towards the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters covered with tailors in La Paz.
Public buildings exhibit a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In all of Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in hand in Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to once again strike the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a outlet on the sea of jurisdiction of the State.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has much to do with the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little will change if it does.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrived just six months after the final arrangements indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the present Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has set any good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was particularly rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "take extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage," he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political squamotage.
" Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will never carry out nuclear weapons disarmament unless it can first rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be planning to restart diplomatic negotiations in stall after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that the continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue the declaration without Pyongyang first carrying out important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President USA Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang intends to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of covers or block the sun completely, do not look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed on the sidewalks a series of crazy overcrowded covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats angered Instagram this summer and these designers sent their attractive creations on the bridge.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige-colored hat decorated with a large edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other overcrowded accessories included nailed anguries, a witch hat and even a pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewing lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than with high stitches.
One creation looked like a complete dive with mask and eyeglasses, while another looked like a loose frozen cone.
And if you continue with the huge declarations of style, you're lucky.
The observatories of the style predict that the huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the trail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide stretch of more than one metre that was seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of worship behind the very impractical hat that invaded the social media sent another huge creation in the gateway: a large straw beach bag almost as the model in costume that wears it.
The orange-colored bag, finished with raffia and with a white leather handle, was the strong piece of the 2019 spring-summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags will arrive in the luxury shops next summer, because the designer has achieved such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, career choice and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and required subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the graduations, with the highest percentages of success within the independent schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained the highest number of votes.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of the students obtained the highest vote with Chinese praise, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will no doubt need them in the future.
At present, languages, as a choice of subjects, are considered at the same level as STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons that employees have indicated for the difficulty of covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of more languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from independent schools, with specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-sampling Sunday opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six pre-sampling games of the Lakers.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare myself," he said.
The time of gathering a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, to a rendezvous.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspended confirmation vote for his choice to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress at the November elections.
At what time will Trump's commission be and how is it possible to follow him online?
Trump's committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow Trump's commission in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of this week of the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense because of the allegations of sexual violence with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts the investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five meetings during the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Deputies," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for its programme that the president will travel in as many states as possible as we are in the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbank Arena, tonight's committee could call back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit the West Virginia, the state in which he had won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the West Virginia University, standing at Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team demonstrates the courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sundays
After three single-sense sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum bike is a totally invented sport concept in which players firmly believe and never as in races like these.
So where's the bike now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of a motorcycle," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with other twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have some wind in favor, as Spieth said, and have a lot to be hopeful about, not lastly the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been sloppy from tea to green and is setting the example.
The gutural shouts of celebration became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts to the game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who made them win the game at the 15th hole was welcomed with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to put it all on your game," Spieth said.
It is all that each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the boisterous crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to stab up a possible European victory while the sun hovers over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have sunk the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they have not even managed far to climb.
However, there's no one on Sunday to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between couples, advice that they give and do not give and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage on the final day but this session of ants showed that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on Ryder Cup's final day after finishing the four-ball and ant Saturday matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the fourballs of the morning, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has been more resilient in the ants, winning two games, but they have not been able to recover the drawback.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a down Woods and the amazing American Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and forsomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning fourballs, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the ants to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world rankings.
Europe, however, has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day to the south-west of Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a gritty 2&1 victory on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the ants, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point waste passing to the individual, although as the owner, Furyk's team only needs a match to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of reach.
North Korea firmly rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was taking up the country's mistrust in the United States, which in such circumstances would have absolutely refused to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the World Organization's General Assembly that North Korea has adopted "important measures of good will" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear test site and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any US-compliant response," he said.
"Without confidence in the USA there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally at first."
Although Ri has re-used the complaints concerning Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement has been important because it has not completely refused unilateral denuclearization as it has already done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea sought a formal end-of-war agreement in the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed appeals to ease the rigid international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The USA insists on the need to "have first denuclearisation" and to increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even oppose the "declaration of the end of war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target the US territory with the North Korean missiles after "the president of evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, which last year had threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the disarmament path, but declared that much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions undertaken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Respect of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported the sanctions to control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit again Pyongyang the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not been well.
It was broken down by Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of having submitted "requests from gangsters."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US had adopted "compliant measures."
He said that Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed himself to Singapore and actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has driven all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counteract the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
A university student found that students at the university number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this type in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why is this only told to me now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course provides for a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, gymnastic shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "black night to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep to a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, marriage, anxiety, explained and even should be used to avoid fattening because lack of sleep brings the brain into an unprecedented way, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having followed one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar curriculum before joining this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set a wake-up for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can turn the circadian rhythm into tilt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the goal of Menga kills Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with Dolly Menga's goal that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticated team to a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibox was looking for the first victory outside the home from the 4-1 triumph of February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach leaving his team at eight points from the leaders fleeing the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga marked seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
While Ranger now goes down to the sixth place, Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for difference in goals.
And there might be additional problems coming for the Rangers after the Calum Spence liner was cured for a head wound due to an object apparently thrown off the outside house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly passed the Ayr in the semi-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that took a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated its opponents each time.
The Rangers may have dominated for ball possession but the Livingston has better exploited the balls at its disposal.
They could have marked just after two minutes when the leaking passage of Menga in the first time sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the center camper wasted the opportunity.
A deep punishment football from Keaghan Jacobs therefore found Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow could only pull side by side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigour.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had to see a rigor at the end of the 15th following a fight with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice at the door in the first time but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even because of his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact since the wing shoved a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the secondment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton submitted a last request for rigour after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGGION continues... the day when the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these earphones on you you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "She's just breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can therefore "see" a protein common to many types of tumors and are then reinjected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovaries cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and so these cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect tumour cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatric wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stabbed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live bet after a disenchanted performance during which he praised the US President Donald Trump and said he would run for 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began to rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often speak white and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL began the show with a screenplay whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star has been taunting Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against the allegations of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the recording of the West Philippine was uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had had a bad time in the backstage because of his cover.
"They bullied me in the backstage.
I was told ‘don’t go out with that hat on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I'm an outcast," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice by the public and the members of the cast of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the newspaper: "The study has dropped a mortal silence."
West had been invited as a substitute for the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days before.
West has puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised by Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the group of conservatives TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you FOR HAVING TEXT TO THE MASS."
But the show conductor Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (purchasing his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embracing a vomity ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion and of course Prince's missing music legend, which had changed his name into a symbol and so in the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stalking in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast east Friday.
The accident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused will have to appear at Belfast preture on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Ministry.
The Throne Star of Harington Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as combatant Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Sword.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that these on-screen soils often make the boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic malehood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with the co-star of Trono di Spade, 31 years old, admitted to worry a lot about this problem.
'Personally I worry, very at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we're watching now?'
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculinity characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes the kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the young.'
During the interview he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequel or sequel to Trono di Spade once the series was finished next summer, stating that "he finished with battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play the main role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the encounter with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Throne of Sword.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose has interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series winning the Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual relations within such reports.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has hacked the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
The U.S. Member has denounced on Saturday the charges to a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The democratic deputy of Los Angeles said that the statements were encouraged by opinionists and websites of the ultra-right wing.
"Tugs, lies and still despicable lies" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing of an expert committee on sexual violence charges against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts has been associated with Waters' office and have issued information regarding a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been put at risk as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has in no way been responsible for the escape of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," wrote Fleischer.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone gets accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get mad.
It must not be provocative.
You must not question the reasons why the accused is here.
You must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a running Republican candidate to remove Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office has warned "the competent authorities and the forces of order of these trendy claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English hits again - the parody of the spy with a Rowan Atkinson undersized
It has become common now to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The rebirth.
Will the veiled self-irion on how gross we are doing be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits got his license to mess things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comical creation developed for non-anglophone film-makers countries.
Of course it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange glamorous claims has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind who contributed with one note to the theme of Gloria's opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It is a character based initially on the traveler and mysterious international man who once Atkinson played in the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English who approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers briefly rattle against his elm.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that movie brands "seri" such as 007 and Mission It is now impossible to offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seems directed to children rather than adults and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as Atkinson's silent movie gags when he plays Mr. Bean.
The current immutable premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the British spy's supersecret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the scrambled agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a trace of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this same-Teresa May character but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the misdemeanor Johnny English, who now works as school executive in a chic facility, but who also teaches in an official way about how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a spying course like School of Rock.
English is defeated in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with its former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl's role in high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the network of the billionaire charismatic of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the left Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; unleash hell by sneaking underground into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take dimesticity with the inside of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as garb and exuberant, there is a lot of children's TV throughout history.
Everything is modest enough.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that made justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be drafting a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings achieved with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
Thus employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, maintaining the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to shift the country to workers.
The transition to a four-day day was supported by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year we are planning to announce a review of the political line."
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the balance of the economy for workers, as well as its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently the subject of discussion."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless leaders" and "speculators" in companies for public services.
The Shadow chancellor plans also imply that current water distribution company shareholders might not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviour considered illegal.
It has also confirmed plans to include employees in business boards and create funds with inclusive participation, so that 10% of the net assets of private sector enterprises are transferred to employees, which end up in the annual dividend pocket of up to 500€.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court of at least one week, and raised the doubt whether the findings of the government agency could influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview going on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring something to light that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, who came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she names couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This New York Saturday will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the performance of a remarkable star cart and has a mission that is equally spectacular: to end poverty in the world.
Upon reaching the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people spill over the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness of the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to carry out a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending email to a world leader, making a call or any other significant way to raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve the intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to ask for an action call, or is it just another example of the so-called "clickivism"- people who really feel the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, employed for a lot of different purposes.
He stated that these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37 billion dollars, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which they have already been paid or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on about 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment and executive partnership, committed to "helping children grow to the maximum of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling on the United Kingdom for better nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the enlargement of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions for nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous path - sometimes we will frame and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", use its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where he is operating on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern top of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval block, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the defendants at the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defined the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make financial levers and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its natural liquid gases to Europe, and to replace Russia, which is the most affordable option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to get out of North Stream 2, draft "unappropriate" gas pipeline which, according to Trump, made Moscow's "prisoner" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that North Stream 2, consumed by $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a project of a purely economic nature.
The Cremlin objectes that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, US Secretary for Energy.
The US position has triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organisation of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to remain outside the EU's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a major problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of running for the Presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will take "serious consideration" of running for president following the mid-term elections.
During a town assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was able to apply.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up our evil government, and that means having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
During the Warren City Assembly he said about President Donald Trump, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by him to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that there's a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters did not believe that they were expected to apply in 2020.
58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not compete, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in support of potential candidacy and 48% in contrast.
Other names of high-profile democrats discussed on a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night
"What's going on with my son, what's going on after he's back, I can put him in contact with other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers are going back with," he told the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other veterans of war, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and any other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic assault and violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and Columbia District support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and District of Columbia Friday presented a friendly curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent sons members of the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's been arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face dilagent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy overturned a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed for a request for asylum to immigrants without documents escaping domestic violence.
Friday the Attorney General of Columbia District, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of the particular circumstances and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," it states in amicus curiae memory.
Within the memory, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants is damaging the economy of the United States, affirming the clear probability that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Accommodation is accessible to those leaving the country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been thought of to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the budget of the dead doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more desperate.
"There is a lot of tension," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little baby feverish in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At all times there's an ambulance that carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, ruining among their friars personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were injured.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, victim of a shoulder fracture and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being cared for outside due to the continued severe harassment.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the sensation given by the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed among the walls, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "preposing" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mutual profits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
The prosecution by Trump, regarding Beijing's attempt to meddle in the US elections, noted what US officials have referred to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While for foreign governments it is normal to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their duties to their respective imports.
China's retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, as stated by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, has written Branstad in an opinion article in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now it increases those pre-potency by publishing advertising advertising in our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the street edicle here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will see no real reflection of the diverse views that the Chinese population may have on China's economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he has not stated that it is the newspaper.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
Since many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various accusations of sexual harassment, analysts have pointed out that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future half-term elections.
The unrest in this regard has been extremely high, and many republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't withdraw these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute's insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Friday, according to Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially between the indecisions of the periphery and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate at the Supreme Court, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP has become a confused set," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, NBC News.
"We don't just talk about the vote for the committee, the final vote, or if Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, the Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom they believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% declares that they have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of Judaism when she was 17.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitals during a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that derives its origins from Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store online is that it is completely at the user's option who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal possession through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology programmers around the world will be able to launch their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't say to "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely untied from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to procure commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the ecclesiastics of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only churchman in the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, won recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had obtained the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons inaugurated a memorial plate.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years from his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battle beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "largest gallantry" he made the line advance before he ran with a single hand cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know he can never be up to and something that makes him more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was truly honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by many people."
MMA fans stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night watching the famous 206 Bellator just to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 combats, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were stout when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some have remained grounded after staying awake until the first hour of the morning especially for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the move to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad-taste joke".
"The government regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move on to the programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for transmission.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six o'clock Sunday mornings and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you that next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he was raised feeling less than anyone due to his own sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24 year old said he didn't realize until he got to secondary school, that "not everyone's like me."
Speaking in the first episode of Desert Island Discs Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made it less important for him to win the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old date program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he had heard "less" anyone else while growing up because "it was socially unacceptable that he liked both the boys and the girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The twice bronze medal at the Olympics became a high profile LGBT activist and used his face at the Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's three-time champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - US director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013- "took me by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed so many in his youth" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be around here so you can be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still didn't realize he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a house audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - that had a particular meaning for him in preparing for the Olympics and still makes him the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-shaped Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will sign a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match of Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back in shape to prevent him from becoming an inflicted billionaire stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelfth time as a record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five times champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in rank, hoping to correct what storms him.
Having never been the strongest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48th year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected route regularly punishes the wrong hits.
And if the course itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the careful champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, the Mickelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went, and that's the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never even mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winning games, 20 defeats and seven pairs, although Furyk has said that his presence has brought intangible goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to play people's games, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that younger players have had fun cementing against him this week, something that has been fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than playing."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a uncomfortable retreat.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, captained by Seven Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I continued to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but recently," Bjorn said (in the picture) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, in Le Golf National.
"That's why it's going to be the story to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we have to give the most.
We need to go out there and do everything right.
It didn't end until the points were marked in the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy is the way his fellows competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get over it.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performance, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are tested hard.
This is the message you need to pass on to players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of yourself.
Then forget about your partner because he too has to go there and throw out the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk will seek in his players the best individual performance more than team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the team winning Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we feel appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the countersponsive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship was postponed again
According to the local media, the last fray of the German military Navy would have to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the cold war, but there will not be until next year at least due to defective systems and an impenetration of costs.
The committee of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the admiral ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to join the Military Navy in 2014, but worrying subsequent delivery issues have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Military Navy in 2007 will replace the old vessels of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use new sinks up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will become already obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate fray Type F-125 made news last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little has been known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have noticed a number of crucial "deficit software and hardware" that have made the ship useless if employed in a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the oldest vessels in the Bremen class.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship weighs considerably too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the military Navy to add future updates.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new sinks become of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "discharges ships capable of being employed".
The official stated that the issue has worsened considerably over time, since old ships disarmed have not been replaced by new vessels.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates were able to join the military Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal the way bats use the view to get their food.
It is hoped that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and guide future protective activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as the brown ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special registrants will be placed in key places around the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of nature for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The populace of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom declined significantly in the last century.
The bats are at risk because of construction and development work that interests trespoli and ruin habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grasping a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect truffles and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization has even established the first reserve of Scotland for bats only at the Threeave estate, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Threeve we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there is a lot about bats that we still don't know, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
It underlines the importance of controlling bats before carrying out maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternal Trespolus can kill up to 400 females and small, perhaps by sweeping away an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their truces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know as if their populations pass it."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while legalists sue the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape charges against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise themselves" by his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also reported on Friday the charge of payment of $375,000 to maintain silence on the event.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo broke the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Gold Balloon directed towards the camera.
"They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the charges, defined as "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions on the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of privacy violations, probably considered one of the most serious of the personal rights of the past few years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas Palms Casino Resort.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he subjected him to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo would get on his knees after the incident saying he was for "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
From the documents it turns out that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Majorga also states that she had gone to the police and hospitals, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by the beatings" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34th year is now seeking to overturn the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer he will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom "could regret forever" the loss of its status as a world leader in the construction of cars following the Brexit," said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "concerned" about the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting momentary block of production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car house claims that delays at borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases concern in other English car manufacturers for exiting the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for one month.
The main concern concerns risks in the supply chain found by manufacturers in case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the "just in time" concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for ordering cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be some problems at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "thought precisely to avoid these problems at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are strongly concerned: "According to my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "remanded for a week", while continuing the dispute on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, declared the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference with elections, the links between Trump's advisers and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted that he was going to quit.
Instead, it was announced on Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation of the questions by the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not been established, it could be this week, I imagine you will be sending yourself back another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might argue: Sanders has not had a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings is not due to an aversion for television journalists "who show up", although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they show up".
So it made him think that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president holds more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this, as in the past few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason, making a free-wheel speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to European workers of the NHS Scotland to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's release from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of the requests for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "There have been ongoing negotiations throughout the summer between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of an unagreed scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and communities to whom we provide a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly desire you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated urgently following a head injury
The tennessee defender State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after bringing a head wound to the game on Saturday against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, as Mike Organ of The Tennesseean reported.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the accident caused the wound occurred shortly before the period.
"He approached the camp and he fainted," said Reed.
First aid personnel and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on board camp before placing it in the barrel and taking it away for further checks.
A Tennessee State leader reported to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no news about the type and extent of damage" and that Tennessee States are trying to understand when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is at her first season with Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five plates before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless according to new workers' plans
The maneuver will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in bubble tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Treasury plans to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, will announce today Theresa May.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing affordable accommodation and higher income.
The increase in bubble taxation will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The overcrowding, which is added to the current bubble tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the real estate buy to lets (purchased to be rented), could be more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Treasury expects that the maneuver can collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had asked for a cut on bubble tax to help the younger with the purchase of the first house.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining the prices of real estate by overcrowding land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up housing quotas at affordable prices to fix the British "real estate disgrace".
Mr Corbyn has announced an exciting series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including the controls on rents and the elimination of unpaid evictions.
He also wants to give the council greater powers on the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, and that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and foreign companies, as is the case for British resident workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the dignity of homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to drive Scotland"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager first or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is attracted by the challenge of getting the North-East team to stand third in the League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after being at the guide of St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in series B and that's all," Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my baby father and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross's predecessors at the Sunderland leadership were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel any anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back."
The start of Ross's career as a manager dates back to three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach of Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa to escape from the retreat to the third level and brought the St. Mirren from the backseat to the title of champions of the Championship, the next season.
Ross claims to feel much more at ease now than during his football career in the teams Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls regarding the direction of the Alloa.
"I really thought the manager's role was done for me, more than the player's.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned myself a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from work but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much more at ease than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has brought more money to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern to the catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, while the receipts of restaurants have fallen by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put the data together and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England at the Worlds made July follow a route similar to that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The collapse of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink mostly turned out to be the strongest, with a homogeneous increase higher than the decrease in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not excessively like the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go outside for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks rose by 6.6% in the month, while consumption of food dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreation and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remains the main factor when it comes to retail sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent per annum will be particularly severe in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long summer hot could not have arrived in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell whether the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
The overall growth in sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-out of the brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for British pubs, bars and restaurants puts together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry’s reference company.
One in five children owns secret accounts of social networks that hide from parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some just 11 years old, owns secret accounts of social networks that hide parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "Fake on Instagram" pages.
The news has strengthened the fear that content is placed on a sexual background
20% of students said they had a "principal" account to show parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts of social networks that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "Fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to Instagram's photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that content is placed on a sexual background.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a clean "principal" account to show to their parents, while maintaining a private one.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who was urging others to "stomp me."
Research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmastersses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, has shown that 40% of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in light athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could gain a huge advantage by bringing it into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I can't wait to act as an athlete's voice and I hope to be able to contribute and help drive sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently a BBC opinionist, found himself unable to walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I would be able to recover and to what extent.
It has been an extensive job but I have recovered completely, he has learned to walk again and today I am moving with agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!".
The advertising of a tidalate compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A company producing a tidalate divided the opinion on the net with an advertisement that compares the nursing mothers and the cows that are mounted.
To mark the launch of what is defined as "the world's first silent and unwearable tidalate", the consumer technology society Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of ridiculous music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new tiralette.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a trail that includes songs like: "Yes, I'm taking my milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed it, these aren't breast but my tits."
The choir continues: "Pick it out, throw it out, feed the children, throw it out, throw it out, throw the milk to my lords."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook pages, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different reactions between the viewers, many of whom claimed that it highlighted the "horrories" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their little ones are stolen a few days from birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie tidalate wears herself discreetly under a bra for mothers
Someone else commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a tidalate for mothers who will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added: "It's really meaningless advertising."
Others defended him and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used tiralate, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irrelevant, but it is not far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a funny advertisement dedicated to mothers who use tidalate (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "flies."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the home industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tiralate in the bra.
The concept that the campaign is inspired by is based on the idea that many women who use tidalate feel like cows.
However, the Elvie tidalate is completely silent, has no threads or tubes and can be inserted into a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms and even get out while they draw the milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "The Elvie tidalate is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use lattice to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tilatte is able to guarantee."
This is not the first time the Elvie Tidalate has reported.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children showed up on the walkway of the designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have silently moved to a tendnpoli at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children increased exponentially even though the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the tough rhetoric and the political line of Trump administration made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them into account were generally illegal immigrants who are now afraid of jeopardizing the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the fingerprints would be taken from potential trustees and other adult members of their families and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to rely on children alone.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to rely on children or belong to the families of these people are illegal in the country and most of them are criminal foreigners.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules so that some of them will have to come to trial within one month from the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to perpetrate their cause of legal status in an immigration court.
Those who will be deemed unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in trust, the greater the risk of anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or escape attempts, according to those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier than the signs of discomfort of children are ignored.
They add that the movement of children into the tendoples without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or greet friends may aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria is committed to the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war had already reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally with the pretext of combating terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without setting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "unfounded fears" which encourage refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be only a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction will not be allocated in Syria until a political agreement will be reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "necessary deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Qaeda-related Front Al-Nusra, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee by stating that the work of the group must be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators might hope, his presidency should not be concluded prematurely due to an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency finale ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of the viewers' bending.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening are more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has on average 2.4 million spectators in the first evening, significantly increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, a showrunner of ABC's "Designed Survival" television series that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In the Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parties: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", he has another theory.
Remember a taxi race in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why do you make me laugh?"
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plan of events in Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
To stop following the news is, however, a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond his duty as an informed citizen to follow for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", of Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("an outfit full of trait" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
For example, I won't be able to look at Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what he does seems to be a reality show is that every night there is news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the arrival of the actors and the daily developments of the Trump show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. that commends Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and while recording the CNN.
He failed to pull off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and before the future uncertainty of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash flow in the race for the most secure half-mandate elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a flow of money thanks to the re-alignment of a congress district that has made it possible for two current members to run for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the district of Pittsburg brings the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who conquered his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in office, the republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January deliberated that in the old districts electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of republicans.
The 17th District race sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a measurement victory in the special elections of March for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has thought of penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then changed their mind
Diplomatics have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 there was a rather friendly meeting between Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's lead group to leave.
The officials of the State Department decided to bring the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", said the spokesperson of the Heather Nauru department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only towards El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million in aid from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been of concern to the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and murdered.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America referred to a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference and thus finally renounce any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was appointed to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without receiving further reproach or punishment messages from Washington.
A Bolton spokesperson at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who still wanted to maintain anonymity.
Study history
In the report that will be published, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now seems to exist sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on the possible collusion of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes to the democrats, Trump should respond to these charges before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his own while preparing for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight may last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed by letting ourselves escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans must face different ones at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year secretly suggested that Trump be subjected to interceptions, questioning his ability to play the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news coming out on the newspaper The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, at the mid-term elections we will vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them great opportunity to qualify for the G Group of Europe League.
Although due to an accident on his knees, Central Camper Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result will allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villarreal is a good team," said the 30-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced of doing good and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the match is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points, but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last match, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will be able not to disappoint.
Last year has certainly been difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is doing well.
We can therefore forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have dealt with the issue in the family.
About half of the interviewees from Nationwide said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% says they've talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but do not face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to assist you if you don't communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for costs.
Involve a financial consultant: you will be able to advise on how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
The choice of funding for long-term assistance may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid policy on life with ransom value to cover these expenses or to continue to pay money for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid in case you are not able to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your old parent is taken urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" Martin asks.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Man hit several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed air gun while falling back on foot after spending the night out.
The victim, a quarantiner, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in any danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is destined to rise.
The communications were interrupted and rescue officials failed to have any information from the Dojaka Regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Dojaka in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dojaka is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and above all the coastal region of Dojaka.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dojaka have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dojaka.
Another tsunami hit the western Dojaga area in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the Pacific fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a severe earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, of which more than half Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke out against the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake struck the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
In this case there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her off the phone by hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility centre and his security was set at $500, according to what was reported by KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree offences, namely detention up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been awarded a second-detainable crime with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Alaskan Court Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic syndrome by stress resulting from the period spent in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity network and the communications network are not functioning and the victim's budget is destined to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit off Sulawesi Centrale, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media they circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks at NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are demanding capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that has caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that has never been executed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of having used a Home Depot rental truck to lead on a cycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Depending on the conditions for the claim of capital punishment in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and likewise "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Week after the attack, a large federal jury charged Saipov 22 chiefs of charge who included eight charges of murder with association to criminalize, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said describing how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused damage, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York prosecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in trial, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was finally sentenced to jail in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminating for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg spouses both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that in front of the investigators they said they were proud of what they did.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As regards the 22 counts, he declared himself not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was said to be "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of accepting a recognition of guilt and condemnation to the jailhouse without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense group had previously prayed to prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the Members of Parliament of the Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former Leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out of Europe" if Farage were the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party were emphasized by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing their attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to force Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the start of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said she wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We would already be out of Europe by now," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion would be changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Parliamentary Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also took part in the parade and told journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who tour the streets by casting votes to allow us to be elected.
Let the Chequers Plan go and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the commission, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they were going to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilise the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour commission in the center of the city.
A small number of activists pushed the Torys against the flags of Brexit after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labourman laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the edges without friction and for the borderless trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist," he concluded.
Warren's seriously thinking of running for the presidency
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would think seriously if she applied for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the democratic senator of the Massachusetts Saturday spoke about his future during a town assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticising President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 was already in the air.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled down.
One participant asked her whether she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to set up the government and this implies that a woman holds the highest position."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Saturday Valteri Bottas qualified in front of his companion Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas leaves well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from the attacks of Vettel in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group tail traffic, which could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the next round by going back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton however overcomes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions where the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent its passage inside risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So drive the race for most of the race without stopping at the rubber change box and try to quickly finish to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
In the end, however, he must make the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
"It's a hard day because Valteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to have me spend.
The team has done exceptional work to win the first and second position," said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the content of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of attempted rape at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "meschines, bad and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and liars," he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is spread and those responsible say "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," he added imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is breached by her office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did it."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who, during Saturday night's commission, commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of attempted sexual offences by three women, the president suggested that democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the evil. They don't care who damage them, those who have to pass over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediaite.

Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in Elite League match against Belfast Giants winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately took advantage of two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier shots.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the house team to the stand before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who had returned to Belfast on Friday night and won the game with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 a.m. on Kendall McFaull's assistant, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was first rather animated, Sullivan brought the team home in game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the parity assistance to Cownie at minute 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The house team came back together and Bouchard regained the match after a strategic maneuver at min. 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led the Dundees to the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by marking the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who at this point lost four of the last five meetings, will play the next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take them off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were scattered because of a severe earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong boarding shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped between the masonry in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Générale remained in his place in the control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport of Palu, which was shaking fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's a really sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims will reach the thousands and the national disaster counter-measures agency indicates that access to the cities of Donjaka, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
High waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial vehicles are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The miniarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the people of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a dispersal after the lagoon crash
The airline of the flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a scatter.
According to news from Air Niugini, updated Saturday afternoon, a passenger misses the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, e.g. age or nationality.
The local vessels saved the other passengers and the crew after the accident while the aircraft was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline states that six passengers have been admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What has caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane is precipitated in the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very low share.
"Ed was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a bridge provided help by using a rubber to transport people on the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft accidents of the airlines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the trial of a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Justice Department Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used his cell phone data to rebuild the twenty-nine-year-old movements accused of Quinton Tellis and the 19th-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he recovered the localization data from several mobile phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that day wasn't in town.
When the public ministry asked him whether Tellis was telling the truth saying that night was in the Sanford truck, the latter confirmed that he was "minding because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is the fact that Telllis claimed to have known the Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data shows instead that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted from his phone Chambers' messages, calls and contact information.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the judge to pass the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting in its positive messages songs.
The High Breed group in Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it broadcasts political messages and denounces social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons recently returned to the United Kingdom thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York Tata cites a couple on trial for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a papa cited a couple on trial for discriminating her after having received by mistake a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that the new Tata, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR ANOTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice, for twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the error, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "ashamed" fired Miss Maurice saying that she had not been happy with their previous papa, an African American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice his day of work and sent him home with a taxi.
Maurice mentioned the couple in court and, to be dismissed, she asked for a compensation for the beauty of $350 per day for the six months of full-time work for which she had initially been hired, even though without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said to the Post on Friday adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism saying that Mauritius's dismissal was the only thing to do because they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her a message saying something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"You would entrust your children to someone you were escorted with, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't hook up with a person in this way.
It's not a very kind behavior," added the financial consultant.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has immediately denounced spouses on social media criticizing them harshly for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's not easy to put herself in the cloths of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
Affirming that the father, who worked as a chamberman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, which you describe as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when he had a son reaching a goal: you are proud even if it's not your credit.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter's phone that she was dying.
At the landing the daughter was taken urgently to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then he called me to tell me she was dead in a few minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly relying.
She died a little while earlier and it was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay."
At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, griefd by the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"For all the time I've done nothing but cry low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are committed to preventing others from performing the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said that he illuminated every room he entered."
But before he died, he left his job because depression had brought him "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They must not isolate themselves, they must speak."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, not long after the death of his mother.
"You never said he felt down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He has torn the family.
He broke us up.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has begun investigations
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and in the field, we could reach an agreement," said Flake on Saturday adding that he feared that the committee was "losing calm" because of the blockade of the root supporters.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks to the mid-term elections on 6 November. If Republicans as planned will get a negative result, they will be strongly weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
We will vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 republicans and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delay and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean political refugees "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, states that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates asked by those who illegally expel these people.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are in a state of stagnation.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to collaborate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has criticized US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be certain of our national security and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament at first," said Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of minority Nancy Pelosi defines the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and states that it is not specifically suitable for this task.
La Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called it hysterical," said Pelosi about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
Visually excited Kavanaugh denied the charge of having sexually molested Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so close to screaming and with his throat narrow from crying while talking about his family and his years at high school.
It has also explicitly condemned the democrats of the committee who have defined the charges against him as an "absolute and coordinated defamatory campaign" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
The Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that it cannot enter the Supreme Court because it has proved to be prevented against the democrats.
"I think he was self-exclusive with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in state of charge if it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court that you're presiding now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh ruled out questions about his intentions to overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that "a hysterical person and part of the Supreme Court cannot be sent and that this decision should be accepted in a positive way."
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatric, months and years of rage attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Don't I think it's weird, and you?"
And he went on, "He helped me a woman who was a leader somewhere. He told me that she was crying when she was angry, but he had developed a technique so that when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it kept going.
I thought his idea was brilliant."
Tears are tolerated as anger exfoliation in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once started crying for an access to anger. A woman older than me, a glacial manager from whom I was always slightly frightened took me for the colloquium and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when a boat called Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extra-conjugal relationship that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for the presidency.
"In fact it wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said to me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and certainly no one else needed it.
Someone called them "Biancanev and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late in fundraising and swore that she would not be a candidate if she had not raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause on the way.
He found that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he had the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, disappointment towards the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was victim of), that he was moved.
"It seemed like you were preying on a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my stone.
Maybe "Pray a lot."
How the US-China Trade War Could Promote Beijing · Global Voices
The opening-up of the trade war between the USA and China was fragorous and, while the battle is yet to be concluded, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items for over $200 billion (EUR 175 billion) of value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods from China.
Beijing has reacted with similar measures every time by applying duties from five to ten percent on 60 billion US dollars of goods.
China has promised to respond to the US hit and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon go back.
Because Washington resigns, it would have to give in to its demands, but publicly bending to the USA would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the USA can positively influence China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than it has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security Research Center.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the devastated country for over seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million who still live in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid subject to conditions or by those countries which supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points that served to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water to the sixteenth hole of par 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his shifts becoming one of four players always to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was contested for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the Thorbjorn Olsen ranking of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to the English Ian Poulter who could have disputed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight of them, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the witness to his national John Ram who beat the legend of the USA Golf Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 on Sunday's singulars.
"If I think I grew up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have fought Tiger Woods," said twenty-three-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four his matches in France and now the count of his meetings in Ryder Cup amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 pairs.
A strange statistic if you think it's one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team sought to find fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf game throughout the tournament.
Captain USA Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europe team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all in.
But they played better than us."
