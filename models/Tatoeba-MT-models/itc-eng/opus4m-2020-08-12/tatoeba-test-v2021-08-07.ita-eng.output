White pedone at f3, black pedone at e6, white pedone at g4, black woman at h4 - mad chess! This is jokingly indicated in chess circles as "study kill".
White: Tower in a1, pedone in b6, king in c8. Black: pedone in a7 and b7, king in a8, alder in b8. The White puts the opponent in the zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which the Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alfender in any other check on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White advances its foot from b6 to b7 and kicks off. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black foot in a7, with the same result.
