The members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they may feel that they are “marionate”
Many members of the National Assembly of Wales are shocked because they were suggested to change their titles, respectively to be called MWP (members of the Wales Parliament).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Gathering of Wales is concerned that he “remits with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "female matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said that the group "is not pleased" as a whole and suggested alternatives.
One Conservative Party member said that the group had an "open" attitude toward changing names, but also noted that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which have made it clear that many of them wish to use the "Gallan Parliament".
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred “members of the Parliament of Wales” or “WMP”, but the option “MWP” received most of the votes in public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft amendment law over a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word as regards their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
On this Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on changing their country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was organized to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an vehement opposer of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take this vote into consideration.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church bells have stopped beating as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the veterans of the place I talked to told me that you used to find a bar and a church on every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today there are no bars and no churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
"The bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather themselves."
And with regard to churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than expected by the leaders and that, “ sooner or later, the disarray will be the same”.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so this will accelerate the closing of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who conducted their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a congregation of African Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's enormaries made plans to rebuild it and included the carion in it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, called the "poor people's bells".
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “a historical instrument of non-replacement”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said he was the first carilon in the world to be played by an African-American musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed to a larger carilon, at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish governing entity, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enormists complained about the lack of transparency that has proved diocesan.
A shark injured a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child, while he swims, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he swims about half an hour with his friends on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that initially he thought the boy was delighted that he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he cried "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole key was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to come out of the water, "He's a shark in the water!"," Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
You don't know the shark species responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a kind of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles further noted that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position on the market for beauty and fashion products in Britain
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available rays with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening position on the market of beauty products in the United Kingdom, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not in a position, the larger rays with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year, if they prove to be a success.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context that supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury retailers said that the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a growing demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailers The Fragrance Shop will be included in two shops of the Chain Sainsbury, for testing purposes, the first being the open one last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Saisbury retailer, said outlets will increasingly look like universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight with large retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offers more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of shops and Habitats since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means that it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The earlier attempt of the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a divergence on how to share Boots' revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-POSAY and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of the Saisbury retailer, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our rays with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
I also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way to make shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
The protagonist of the TV show "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes household accessories and items.
The couple company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Presenting the 37-year-old ‘This Morning’ show, Instagram announced that he would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated the rage of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the “Dragons’ Den” show, withdrawing at the last moment from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most loving people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, would no longer allow them to dedicate themselves to their brand, Truly, which includes household accessories and objects.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune with an estimated £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced to Instagram that he would give up the Truly contract, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was a little longer until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" show, which is among the best-selling brands in Britain, could result in millions of damage to the company, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing items and household items, as well as the possible further delay of the launch.
It may also represent the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten years old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundation of the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as their director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S trade mark and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the "I'm A Celebrity" TV show.
A nearby source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business. ”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics that he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider to be “unnecessary for a president” and about the fact that he has such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a big step back?
He said Trump mimicking a voice of "news presenter".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said that Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have ceased.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe an "appropriate response" from the United States on previous North Korea disarmament measures.
He noted, however, that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"It's all going well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim had positive results: cessation of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the American military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I were to behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to get into this incapacitated arena, there would be about 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, there has been no national disaster, a necessary condition for the launching of aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a somewhat difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the "Save Children" Foundation is trying to form a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Agency for National Disasters, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
Given the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia constantly, it is unthinkable that the country continues to be prepared insufficient for nature's anger.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , they are not very often found on other coasts .
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate and more this.
A hospital ship that parked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of the pre-infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of his electoral campaign and gave urgent money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate next year in a new electoral campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sects in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, because gangs of Christians and Muslims broke down on the streets, using pots, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the goal of the rescue and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea team, with a goal on the 89th of Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge took a step from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 meters away from the side team gate, and his team was led by Chelsea by 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a blow in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached above that, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed from Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to it and fell into the gate.
"I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, just took the ball further."
Chelsea took 1-0 to the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the land and ran to half the land of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick move by one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the street.
Hazard passed the defense and sent the ball into the net, succeeding in hitting it with his left foot and passing by the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team at the League of Champions on Wednesday at 15:00 on the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the videoton team in UEFA Europa League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, has been covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman through the stab.
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street and was arrested by a man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who heard or saw something about this subject to come to the statement station.
Detective Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who have heard or seen something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the onboard room to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the body belonged to a woman from Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who thought they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few more hours until they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
Repeat continually “it’s so terrible.”
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and one more was outside.
A few police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is requested to send a message directly to the @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at phone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the alternations on "history rewrite"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban style of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell’s society described Jeremy Crick’s suggestion as “a crazy” and“ an attempt to rewrite history. ”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate that the removal of the statues as Oliver Cromwell’s figure from the Westminster Palace became a target.
The Iconoclasm of English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which represents a part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and commemorated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media agencies.
The man, identified only by the name ‘Yuan’ family, was found dead after he was segregated an artery and was covered by blood, near a pig farm in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, according to the Morning Post South China Sunday editorial.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he had come with his cousin from nearby province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
He said that in the elbow there was a big-sized male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and finite," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative said for Evening News that the pig was locked up to stop him from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that the Yuan family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although they are rare, there have been reports of cases of pigs that attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a pig of 300 kg, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
“Simply play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it has begun to form a depressed area across the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rain in the south-west in the following days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical moisture will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevade and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the south-west, in particular in the majority of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapid deterioration conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot in view of the threat posed by tropical rain.
The heavy rain could cause canoes to be turned into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The nearby depressed area will bring torrential rains to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor flows of wastes and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Spreaded tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and the first part of the day of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
Intense precipitation will spread in the so-called "four corners" Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense changes of temperature in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature on short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences in the central area of the United States are found.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended summer heat will try to form and expand again.
A large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to face a warm October start, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain portions of the north-east.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high temperatures above average for the US by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, the TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last-hour news: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an indictment investigation for a week.
Ford said in front of the judge's committee that she's 100% sure Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it's 100% certain this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted the average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of viewers of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while the protesters shouted at him and he was trying to get into an elevator at a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people were fighting him, and everything was broadcast live to CNN.
"I find myself right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells us the truth?
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast live the vote in the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI agreed to consider the charges against the nominee next week, demanded by the minority democrats.
Flake was mostly convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and more senators after that.
Flake's choice was an important one, since the Republicans would obviously not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Great Britain and of submining national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, attended the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with his photograph on the front page of the paper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Czechers plan, saying that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the European Union to collect their rates was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected he shot the LSU player dead.
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with grade 2 murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he recognized the fact that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Legal Medicine Office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department shall be entitled to the Louisiana Police Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of that area for the aid provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
Athletic director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligence and seeking justice".
Sims was 20.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it scored, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said that the team is "stricken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This concerns me all the time, ” Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep distance from the volcano after activity in craters began and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors several noises and vibrations.
The images on the social networks presented thin layers of ashes on the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km south-east of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Pro-Independence protestors fought with the gendarmes, on the first anniversary of the vote for the sequence of Catalonia, gathering thousands of demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
Charges were intensified later, using the police to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive," while the Union protestors shouted "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wishes to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters elected, by a large majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote was low, and those against the secession boycotted largely the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped last Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new way.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments in my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing left to do," he said.
Despite the achievement of a vital but tight victory in the regional elections of December, last year, Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain the advance this year, many of the best known leaders seeking either exile or detention, waiting for the trial for the role of organizing the referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to denounce regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Most men were arrested after entering a house with their car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday about 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage was caused to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at one point a wart was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unreply, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Ibox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level with Hibernian on the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory moving in Premier League this season and confronts the Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues unbeatable in division up to six matches, Holt's main coach still feeling the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team should have moved ahead long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to knock on the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to whisper wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble to the visitors at the free hits.
And that was how the crucial void came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to care for Menga, who shook and scored from the center of that.
At that stage, Rangers dominated possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and the doorman Liam Kelly was no longer in the sea disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow hit a big shot from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to come in which the Livingston team, but without success, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett abruptly shocked Glenn Middleton and after a halt - were not accepted.
"Feminal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A phenomenal performance and outcome for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending path.
Their game style and team haven't changed at all since the top comeback, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the whole game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they have had good performances since they are led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty steps have been unsuccessful, they have only once managed to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the ranking.
Joint reactions on Erdogan's visit to Köln
Everything was pink Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy with problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police have invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a lot of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but have gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, most Kurdish, have heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it with open arms in the country.
In contrast, the protests reflect the division in respect of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks of Germany and one autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place just a few months after another biker died from an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a mile away from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said the officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of the buses is diverted, and motorcycles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured following a fight
Six prison officers were injured following a riot at a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, there was a fight at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire about 9:30, which is ongoing.
Specialized officers have been brought to deal with fighting, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor front injuries.
A prison spokesman said: “The specialized prison staff have been asked to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer time after the graces."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the riot officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (drought areas can benefit as a result)
There is a rare occurrence of tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flooding warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second day of the month it will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix announced in a message on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression about 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action on a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Uragane predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the south-west, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities of between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas the torrential rain will be beneficial, as the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona faces at least one severe drought, and the second largest category," information found on weather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the California Baja Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of the month.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, with a high flood risk.
"The torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm are expected" from Baja California to the north-west of Sonoria, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or his remains is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, North-West Sonoria and the desert in the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Center for Uragane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams into the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers requested the help of citizens who could have materials on their mobile phone, respectively, to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced “disgrace and anger” of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh faced “disgruntling and anger” of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims about stalking her sex ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage."
"A confirmation vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he told many West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the republican presence at the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express all over my positive opinion about the candidates I consider to be outstanding."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place on Friday, a GOP assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, with increasing numbers
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and a tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at dawn, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their way.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami brought cars, trunks, houses, hitting everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled widely at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to get into trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present several buildings and shops destroyed, overthrown and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the relics continued to rock the city on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima in World War II.
Probably the geographic structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf, intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, added the representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, besides the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be larger along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Dojaka, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disrupted, without any information" in Dojaka, Nugroho said.
There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would strike Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time of issuing the warning.
In the posts on social networks, one can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching to people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in the Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began sending aid cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, they told the authorities, but people evacuated still need food and other basic things.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the staff Word Vision from Dojaka arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are trapped in improvised shelters in the court of the office, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they had seen many destroyed houses.”
The situation is very serious.
Although aid groups have begun to start aid in the event of disaster, some people have complained that comprehensively experienced foreign workers have been prevented from travelling to the Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, delivery of materials and staff can only reach the place where a disaster is produced if the national disaster area is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster in the province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government will say, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced."
After the second night of the earthquake and the Friday tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the disappeared hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who was under two days' ruin with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people from the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after spreading news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel in the sport paragliding community, he sent desperate messages to WhatsApp competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there appeared only a gray bispher, and not two blue bispers.
"I think that means the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a ATM from Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Department of Police in Newport.
The car driver emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “runs through the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the press release, witnesses observed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
The Kanye West rapper changes its stage name to "Ye".
He made Saturday's announcement on Twitter change: "the person officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called "Yes" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before it appears at the Saturday Night Live show, where they expect to launch their new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "on grounds of emotional nature", mentioned the producer of the show.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation for the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious significance for it.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly known word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, in the discussion on the title of the Big Boy Radio Host album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it reached "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, bad, unclear things and of the whole.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He's one of many rappers who chose to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes with cream, sometimes without, as well as with large letters.
President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, with the country approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the student left movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and by opening several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on field research, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after more U.S. government members have made announcements about AI, even if an official strategy for artificial intelligence is missing in the U.S..
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first on AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubleing the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "IA Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, which was the best in the field at the time, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and CEO of Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China puts a lot of dicks on the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to intensify its efforts by AI.
"I think he should automatically offer a doctor's visa in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations offer money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, for the purpose of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the American Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
At this time, NSF also invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes in United States legislation aimed at setting up a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece for a decade, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June with regard to the new name proposed, but opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign cast doubt as to the presence of the vote, and that the minimum limit of 50% needed for the validation of the referendum may not be reached.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO accession, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of Name Change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia will live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, told Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The Electoral Commission of the State stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the latest parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to the vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjoise Tanevski, aged 62, a voter from Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of Macedonian name, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and drew chairs in front of the high tents of those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can head to other countries, such as China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said that membership in NATO will bring such necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that most will be in favour of changing names, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that a result in the change of name would be “confirming our future”.
According to a survey published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the required number of participants.
According to another survey by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-vestic government policy since the government took over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the entire Brighton team defense and mark a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defense and won the Manchester City team's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th.
The Argentine attacker took a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before he reached the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to get past a defender, and then he passed more players on the edge of Brighton's team.
After that, he took a step to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, succeeding to avoid the doorman at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a writ to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is facing a few foot problems," said reporters Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote a blank at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Azuras in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took a deep step on Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he took a step on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dropped the balloon a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it to the gate.
The Azure attacker hit the balloon to the net just before he headed outside the field.
Manchester City will meet on Tuesday at 12:55, with Hoffenheim in the group phase, on Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to do the ravines in the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the play-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in play-off for Rockies, which have an advantage with a game faced by Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep its first title of division.
"Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer hit first in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the match number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The middleman in Washington has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 failures in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation concerning the decision by the Supreme Court concerning Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the presence of republics in the interim elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I don't run, but I'm actually running, which is why I'm trying out of power to support the good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, see what happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "sorry and evil, abusive and liars."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is a member of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, which has been strongly violated by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
What?
Hmm... I... wait a minute - that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different perspective.
Persons expressing their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised that Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of censure as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party of Parliament who have been told they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion was critical to my address because I did not agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, that Jeremy did not have a common view with previous leaders.
The Communication for the Nottingham East Friday meeting of the Labour Party mentioned that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the eight-year term as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, today many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, more gentle" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party’s leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom we had a common vision of politics began to expect to change my thinking and agree with some things I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there's a wave of abuse on the desocialization networks that demand my elimination from the party, denouncing center policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who confronts this.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes less and less flexible in this regard.
Many people have advised me over the past two years to put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything will be "good" like that.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the negligence that the Thatcher government has given evidence to my class collapse, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who have the greatest need for them, as a local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including at the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that I disagree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear to him.
People who have supported the motion on Friday can only tell them that, in the context of the country heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the only message I wish to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and promise you that no threat to the elimination of the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team arrives at the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials have somehow influenced the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's extremely interactive game from Tenent's Premiership.
He's now at the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, everything was summed up in their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more advantage of the chances they had, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to several tests through our games so far and we continue to be unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The merit is given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of more chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt of the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed Melrose's team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, he managed to sign up, and then he managed to turn an individual test, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second shot very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was pulled out of the field with the targa, and from the start of the game, Ayr disbanded through the attempt of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Clima.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an unprocessed test of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he plated Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, offering the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the test, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
View of the Still Game site seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game sitcom, seems to be prepared to move to the hospitality industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's beloved show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next series, with the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman plans his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to become involved in "the restaurant development industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia Island hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings tree the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: “The sea is our right.
We need to get her back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit at sea, the memory of a lost coastline in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just like the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary advantage, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of strong discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial struggle for the rebirth of next year – also has much to gain from the decision of Monday .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too few things would change if it happened.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after final pleas have been heard indicates that this case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And not only that Bolivia has not had any success, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have no longer exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of mutual disagreement," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass over the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if he couldn't trust Washington.
Ri talked about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect his promises made during a Singapore summit with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it is an "unreal vision" as the continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war ever to make the territory of the north give in.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the declaration without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will soon be available in stores
If you are looking for hats to extend your collection or protect you completely from the sun, you should no longer search.
Fashion makers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their 2019 spring-summer collection.
The practical hats won the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, of beige color, with a wide bud, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories have included beaded peacocks, a ware hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion high sewing.
One of the creatures seemed to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be an ice cream cone.
And if you want to keep adopting such a dress style, with oversized clothes articles, you're lucky.
Stylists are planning a return of huge dolls in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide bore, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the completely practical hat that appeared on all social networks led to the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, and of the straw stock for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathroom that wears it.
The orange bag of the Rafie, with fringes of the Rafie and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer collection 2019 "La Riviera" of Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, said for FEMAIL: "I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury shops next summer, because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results at examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide services at the highest level to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words reach his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now foreign languages, as a matter, are held as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent curriculums and in other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers to fight for job vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills become increasingly imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a life-long ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults from Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a percentage of two figures, 15%.
Therefore, investment in foreign language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a greater chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more choice languages in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that are specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so that this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make the debut at Lakers Sunday, in San Diego
Waiting is almost the end for fans who want to see him LeBron James as he debuts for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in opening Sunday's pressure on Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play still to settle.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James would probably play limited minutes.
Following training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Six-Game Lakers program in the prison.
“ At this stage of my career, I don’t need pressure games to prepare myself, ” he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a series of campaigning matches in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump matches scheduled for next week, including stops where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
How the confirmation vote for his elected candidate for the free place of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections from the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans risk losing control over Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense due to allegations of improper sexual behavior, while the expected confirmation vote of the Senate is suspended for a week, so that the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, to gain some land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five next week's matches is "the energy of volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," said Reuters, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be called.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being conducted in polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple tests starting on Sunday
After three clear-dominated sessions, it's possible that the form test Saturday afternoon was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The constantly oscillating slope of motivation is an invented concept for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, all the more in the case of competitions like this.
So, where is their motivation now?
"They were driving us six points, now the difference is just four points, so we rely on this decrease for a little bit of motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with an advance of four points, when there are still twelve points in play.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those gouts of holidays became increasingly noisy as the round progressed, especially when he entered a crucial point by which he returned to equality the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry only about your own game," Spieth says.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems they can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any additional hit Saturday afternoon, but this statement is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, well for the nine Friday morning points.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces their view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would eventually lead to a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, in different holes.
Debates of the European Parliament on the glory of the European Union remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he made a pair with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into such a deep pit that they weren't even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and ants are fascinating and deserve close attention due to the interactions between pairs, the given and undecided advice and how a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this session of ants has shown that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the Ryder Cup final day
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after the end of the fourballs and ants on Saturday with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
Inspired by the pair composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two winners in front of an outgoing Tiger Woods, which raised their score from so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the fourballs test this morning and won the score series 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the forsome test, where it won two matches, but it could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice who wins four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair who wins four points from the four opening games throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs test, they superbly supported themselves to defeat discouraged Woods and American novices Bryson Dechambeau with a even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius glimmers, but so far he lost 19 of the 29 games at fourballs and ants, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with his partner Henrik Stenson on the forsome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe has not, however, had a smooth journey on this pleasant and refreshing day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win with 2-1 a game fought against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then they came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the ants test, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the simple trials, though, because they are current trophy owners, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after they were on the second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that prolonging sanctions will deepen mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for its country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the Global Council that "significant measures have been implemented in North Korea to prove their good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing location and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we see no adequate response from the United States,” he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can't disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri resumed North Korea's family objections to Washington's opposition to a "shocked" denuclearization approach, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its declaration seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as did the Phenian in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump offered guarantees on North Korea security.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States stated that Phenian must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not given rise to requests for the relaxation of the hard international sanctions imposed by North Korea.
‘SUA insists on the option ‘first denuclearisation’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, but even objects against ‘war conclusion declaration’’, Ri said.
"The impression that the sanctions can get us to kneel is an illusion that only people who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that the extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korean President of the last five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this dead end."
Even in these circumstances, Ri's tone of speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target US territory with missiles from North Korea after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "man-racquet" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but stated that the work was only beginning and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no scheduled time for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday for the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without interruptions until we get complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for nuclear programmes and on the ballistic missiles of Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said there was progress, but after only a few hours, North Korea denounced that he had made “gangsterist threats”.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has undertaken to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing "macho" culture that makes them subject to "all night" learning sessions, energyed with a lot of caffeine.
One scientist found that sometimes students at the world’s most prestigious universities do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this guy in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
"In the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why is this just now, in the last year?"
She told me that she never talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course, introduced first this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance, as well as the general good condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously sleepless during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a series of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a room of home, and students can click on coffee cans, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
"We know that we can't change student behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking are on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into an increasing problem.
The sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after he took part in one of his first years at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar curriculum of studies before joining this institution where competition is acute.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking hours, and to know what the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal goes down Gerrard's team
Rangers is suffering from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's hit sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Ibox wanted to win the first victory in moving from the 4-1 triumph won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga wrote seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players from Rangers didn't seem at any time able to match.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed on the third place, behind Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers might also face other problems, because the Calum Spence cough referee had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown from the fan lawn of the visiting team.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easy against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated its opponents during the game.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used more effectively the balls they had.
He should have scored just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first step pushed Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the middleman missed a very good occasion.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took over, but they left the impression that more hope than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he hit Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demand.
Rangers managed only two hits on the gate in the first shot, but the former porter on Ibox, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or the weak hit of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's 34th minute goal has not respected the trend of the game, no one can deny that it has been deserved, either for the effort submitted.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept his calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost paid off immediately, when extreme focused on Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out of the buttons to block it.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after centering.
Holt's team could have extended its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent his head off the corner door.
Glenn Middleton, reserve at Rangers, called for a penalty towards the end of the game, when Jacobs hit again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count CONTINUE...), is the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, Geiger has become essential for pop culture, as has happened in the film "The Clopots of San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely scientific tendencies:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, a lot of punches are being heard! ”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" and destroy harmful cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results for patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have to deal with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovaries, pulmonary and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to remove the immune cells from patients and to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a dialogue of support for Trump, while wearing a MAGA cap, after appearing at SNL.
Didn't get out too well
Kanye West was released into the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a disbanded show praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he intends to run for the 2020 election.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist!’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, where the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatric film was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West's foot with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had backstage problems because of his scissors.
“They tried to intimidate me in the backyard.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I was assaulted!
They also told me we got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see how low I got?", then he said, "I'm gonna get Superman's coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted public escapes at least twice, and members of the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person from this team told the publication: “A complete silence has been established in the studio.”
West was invited as the last hour's replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose loved one, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he played song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you for having confronted Gloata."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") about which I believe he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West is following Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then in "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder for a stab in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected for months before the Court of Belfast.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the throne Urzeala, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy Urzeala Tronulus, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think there must be tough to be respected.
In an interview for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that it seems to him that something wrong happened and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Urzeala Tron dus, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, acknowledged that he is "very determined" to talk about this issue.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to grow up, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television might be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What does the young boys learn from TV and the street, what makes them think there must be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong happened to young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play any series based on the Urzeala Tronos after the series ended in the summer of next year, saying that he “finished with the fields of battle and with horses. ”
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West play by Sam Shepard, who presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the Urzeala Tronulus series is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so she assured me of the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of the Republican Party's senators, talks about "dangerous mines" and "theories of conspiracy"
The representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extremely right".
"Minds, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information disclosed included Senators' personal addresses and telephone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of improper sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘Member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, has in no way been responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," wrote Fleischer.
“ This suggests that he does not have the temperament needed to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
They shall not question the motivation of the accuser.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“ Important, if it is true, ” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned “the appropriate authorities and legal entities about these false charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English hits again: windless parody of spy films, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to search for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film series of the parodys of the action films that has as its main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this dreary satire of how strange we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
However, Johnny English’s incompetent spy with staring eyes and rubber face, was renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The character’s name means, firstly, that it is a general comical creation for the cinematographic public in the non-speaking English countries.
He is, of course, the squeaky secret agent who, despite his luxury and extravagance claims, has a little bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that guy who contributed with a single note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard ads for TV, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because ‘serious’ films, such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, provide reliable comical moments as an ingredient.
The humor seems to address children more than adults and, for me, Johnny English's twinkling adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's moving film gags when he plays Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies and revealed the identities of undercover English agents, to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a pompous and under siege prime minister, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with his character like Theresa May, but the scenario does not give him the chance to shine.
His secret information advisers inform him that all active spies have been compromised, so they must activate a reserve agent.
It is itself Johnny English's zevjet, now working as a teacher in a school for the top class, but it also gives lessons about how to be a covert agent. Here are some nice pencils, because English runs a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of creating the mixes in His Majesty's secret service return to action, facing the beautiful fatal women Ophelia Bulletinova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a billionaire charismatic of the technology industry that claims he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in an odyssey of burlestic adventures: dressed in waiters, set fire to a French restaurant fashionable, create chaos when sneaking on board Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colourful the film, it looks like a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other films with Johnny English, can't I stop asking myself: can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role in his talent?
The workers deny that they plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants company heads to take advantage of possible savings due to the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) giving employees another day off.
Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not be changed.
The sources say that the idea would "appropriate" the party's economic agenda, which wants to shift the balance in favour of the workers.
The four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way that workers can benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership said for The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration to address the rebalancing party of the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's pledges in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
The Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's workshop to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from the "faceless directors" and "profiters" from the utility companies.
The plans of the Lord Chancellor of the Umbrian Cabinet also refer to the fact that current shareholders of the water-supplying kings may not recover their actions in full, because the Labour Government could perceive “deductions” because of crimes found.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company boards and to create real estate funds to transfer 10% of private sector capital to employees, which will thus receive annual dividends of up to around 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the show "60 Minutes" if the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI would make them change their mind
The FBI investigation of the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court at least a week ago and raised the question whether Republican senators could be convinced that they would no longer support him because of the FBI findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Certainly," Kennedy said.
“I said this at the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?
The answer was decided, promptly, without error."
Graham's vote, however, seems dug into the stone.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be a need for some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett decisively rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something will change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive group of stars will participate, with a equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
In addition to the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the central park lawn, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting actively against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making telephone calls or other significant things that help increase the level of awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what success has the Global Citizens' Festival had when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they've made something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, in 2011 more than 19 million “actions” were registered from its supporters, who promoted different objectives.
The organization says these actions have driven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in the account of which at least $10 billion was already spent or close.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with headquarters in Britain of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to “helping children grow to their full potential”, which has promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the elimination of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become just a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great moves for civil rights or anti-apartheid that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will sing at this New York year's event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces for a "block" to make Russia's energy exports difficult, says the Home Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, unveiled US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I am in the Middle East is that I want to mediate energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and methods of managing the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go out on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants to an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is declared the "voice of the energy consumer" in the USA.
It continued to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuel," he said, saying about Russia, "you know one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of Trump’s administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the North Gas Pipe Stream 2, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a Moscow “prisoner”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, 110 billion cubic metres away, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we're looking at things the same way: energy can't be an instrument where pressure is put and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, energy minister in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted critics from Germany, who reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industries in Germany (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is involved in matters concerning our energy," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of Industries of Germany (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “thinks seriously” to run for the 2020 presidential election, says the senator from Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he had to “think seriously ” if he was to run for presidential election after the mid-term election.
During the meeting in the town hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's what a strong woman needs," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll think seriously if I run for presidential election."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's voters believe they should run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, he reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome she suffers from Track Palin, at a rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
“The works that my own son passes through, through which he has gone back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers return with,” he told the public gathered at a rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "came back a little different, harder, wondering if there was any respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, did for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and holding a firearm intoxicated state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum application policy
Eighteen States and Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new US policy refusing to grant asylum to victims trying to escape violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District completed a friendly request on Friday in Washington to support a challenge of asylum policy, reports NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner “and his violent, gang members,” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The so-called state lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who have produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a widespread problem with gas and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy cancelled a 2014 decision of the Board for Appeals of Immigrants that allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“The federal law states that all asylum applications must be tried on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such limitation violates this principle,” writes friendly curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy refusing the entry of immigrants affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to “provide the necessary labour force”.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June judges for immigration cases to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape abuse and violence of gangs.
“The asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion,” Sessions said on 11 June when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is abducting her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
The residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 on Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replications.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris said for Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda claims"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of mixing in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The claim that Beijing is trying to mix in U.S. elections marked what US officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war involving surges of import tariffs.
The rates imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing wounded American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of a commercial in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of free speech and free media in America," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the newsstand on the streets here in Beijing you will find few voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views Chinese citizens have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what newspaper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, warns analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several sexual abuse charges, analysts warned that there would be a counter-reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most of the republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"As such reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that the latest initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (the representative of Arizona) on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive group, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors chanted "Wine November!" while demonstrating in the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female voters who are indecisive in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not approve the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse charges brought to the Supreme Court by the nominees, analysts suggested that they might follow a counter-reaction if the republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This became a mix-up for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, an electoral support group of the Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe him later.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe that Ford's testimony was likely to be true, while 35% said they believed it strongly or that it was likely that Kavanaugh's testimony was true.
Besides, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or definitely, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore an oath to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exposed her genitals in front of her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archives" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this personal data archive online is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this ‘personal consolidation by data’.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so that Solid is available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up at once.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in World War I are celebrated
The only Anglican Church cleric who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he was awarded the highest military honor of Great Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that he was “little symbolic” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a very despicable fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked a artillery nest alone and managed to eliminate three of the weapons from the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “a thing that I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel dizzy. ”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given to him by many people."
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you couldn't track the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was getting ready to face Rory MacDonald, British spectators were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode from Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
A fan described Twitter as moving to the cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 in the morning, so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about transmission.
"Peppa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator's company, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be watched by UK spectators.
"When I think about replays, I think we might probably work out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning one Sunday here and we won't be able to do this by Sunday, our hour, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will sum up to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer fans more and we exceeded the limit.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic scubamer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sport said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me."
Invited to the first show Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talks about the rights of gay people to give them "hope".
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to me also boys and girls."
He said: "So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to gain success."
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned LGBT champion and took advantage of the appearance of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had decided to speak because he felt fortunate that he could live free, without pursuit, and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The world champion triple said he was "surprised" by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the winning filmmaker of the Oscar prize, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed "the whole perspective."
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t say ‘you couldn’t be first, Dad’,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and just after he stopped breathing and died, I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this is what I dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling," he said.
This inspired him also in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excited him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Saturday, when he plays in the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back to a good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the tests of fourballs and ants on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has often been for the United States team, the winner of major tournaments has divided his day between being a major player for teammates and practicing his hits, hoping he will correct what he has done wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the rightest drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain of Le Golf National, where long areas of rough often punish the incorrect hits.
And if the land is not a challenge enough to the sea, on the ninth Sunday Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous champion of British Open, who has allied himself with the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for Americans, driven four points at the entrance to the 12 simple matches, which must begin forcefully at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't say anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on my shoulder, hugged me, and told me he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened and that's how I thought we had to proceed.
He wants me to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some intangible benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, it likes to joke with players, it's a wonderful guy in the crew locker," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see him do that during the week.
Its role is more important, not just to play."
Captain of Europe's team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple evidence in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros drove the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 1411⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I remember having had a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where I could hardly win," said Bjorn (in the picture) after following how the 2018 team won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now driving with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, my team and I, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play the maximum shift.
Let's get out on the field and make everything perfect.
The game is not ready until the points are placed on the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophy, it has to remain the goal.
We always said, we need to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know what we're looking for on the other side: the best players in the world."
Glad to see how his players managed on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's quite another situation.
Tomorrow are important individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to pass to the players, that it has to be in the best form tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at the simple test than they did with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the team winning Brookline, then on the losing one when Europe succeeded in the "miracle of the Medina".
"I remember every word," he answered when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw of 1999 succeeded to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we'd like to start with some quick winners, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We created our proper lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was drawn to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans of the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for the simple test.
The new warship of Germany, postponed again
Germany's newest naval force should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen year after year, due to defective systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The operation of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the standard ship of the new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has now been delayed by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which reads a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are supposed to be provided with a strong cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which ensure a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; new frigates should be able to go on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these last generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will already be aged before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 was discussed in last year's press when Germany's Military Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship had a lot too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Military Navy to add future supplies.
The 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as difficult as the vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty mechanisms, and the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an enormous figure of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newer ones end with special importance given the latest warnings that say that the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Commission in the parliament of Germany, acknowledged that the Military Navy "has begun to remain without vessels which can be sent to missions".
The officer said that the problem has grown steadily over time, because the old vessels have been removed from operation without being replaced with some new ones.
He complained that none of the frigates in Baden-Wuerttemberg class went into operation within the Military Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a property of Scottish Highlands want to reveal how they use environmental bats to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key places around the property to track the activity of bats during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of bat sounds and what species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used for each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grassland, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain have fallen considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, just like flies traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also home cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control the nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only reservation of bats in Scotland, on the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Thrave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to multiply."
It stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance work on property, because simply unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of violating a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the football player paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Golden Balloon in front of the video camera.
“I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of these charges, which they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions of private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player will seek compensation for “corresponding moral damage with an adequate amount for the severity of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
The mayor claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of him and told him that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99 %", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
The mayor claims that the police were addressed and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was “terred by the possibility of revenge” and was concerned that she would be “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
Britain would "sorry forever" if it lost world leader status in the production of cars after Brexit, said Secretary for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxiety" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis trademarks of Toyota are manufactured, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of coming out of the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, he will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
The Toyota production line works on the basis of the "fix-on-time" principle: for order-made machines, parts arrive within 37 minutes of suppliers from Britain and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems on the border may arise, which, according to industrial manufacturers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for one day at her Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresse May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely balanced to avoid these border delays".
"There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the present success but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for today's BBC Radio 4 show.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota was unable to specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the factory over the long term and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs will never return."
A government spokesperson said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "done another week," because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors about the possibility of Trump firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month she went to the White House, and reports claim she was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the New York headquarters of the United Nations.
Trump said that "he would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been established yet. It may be this week or may be delayed for a week, taking into account all the other things that are now happening in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue this: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Gazda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy against TV reporters, who like to show themselves, although he added: "I do not deny that they like to show themselves."
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president participates in more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"There will be more briefings," said Sanders, but "it seems much better for the press to have the opportunity to direct questions to the President of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you've noticed that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this happens, having an improvised appearance, on strange locations, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under the conditions that there are less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already made its commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be made this fall.
But the United Kingdom Government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no EU exit agreement.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I wish to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subject to emergency surgery after a head shot
The foundation of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he had a head shot on Saturday, in the match that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, score 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Senior coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place shortly before the break.
"He reached the cough line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie's mask of oxygen was placed by the physical preparers and medical personnel, on the cough line, before sitting on a deck and transporting it from the field for a thorough evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/width of accident" and that Tennessee States is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, student in the year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five total plaques before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 placards throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court fee on buying a property in the United Kingdom, following that additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote
The stamp court fee will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasury is expected to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will apply a higher rate of the stamp court tax to the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as is due today to announce Theresa May.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success of attracting young people with voting rights, promising houses with more advantageous prices and targeting people with high incomes.
The higher court fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money obtained thus will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
Suprataxa, which is added to the current stamp court rate, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for the purpose of renting, could reach a value of 3%.
The treasury expects this change to bring up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are bought by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy has only come a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked to reduce the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high prices on property as a result of the purchase of land without using them and asked Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable houses in order to solve the "home problem" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of unchanged evacuations.
He also wishes to offer the larger power councils with regard to the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my premier mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying existing problems on the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as those who live abroad, can buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become one too far away, and life in unworthy conditions is too much real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of the Scottish national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the national team of Scotland.
Scotsman, 42 years old, enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the north-eastern club, which is currently on 3rd place in the First League, with a difference of three points from the first place.
He moved this summer to the team on the Stadium of Light after last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got on the National B team and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland for Sportsound.
"But I spent most of my childhood chasing Scotland's games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross's predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland club, are Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic said he has no emotion to be the successor of such consecrated names and to such an important club, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team come back to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in running, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the training staff at Hearts.
Then he helped the Alloa club come back after he graduated back into Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the backgrading, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the Alloa Club.
"I really thought I'd be more of a manager than a player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I'm dealing with similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel that this is the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel that it's the best thing that suits me in my entire adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sportsound show on Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a beer halve is Saturday at 17:30, according to a survey
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in revenues in the pubs in Britain, but putting more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars showed an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA that provides business advisory services and conducted the survey, said: “Continuous heat and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a printing in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers smaller than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has fallen further in July.
Pubs and bars that serve only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
Looks like people just came out to consume drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM company offering services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large sports and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% of the year will be added to current cost pressures.
The long summer cannicular could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over £9 billion, which is the official industry standard.
One of five children has a secret account on a social network that he hides from parents
According to a survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a social network that is hiding from parents and teachers.
A survey carried out at the level of a number of 20,000 gym students revealed an increase in “False Insta” accounts
Knowledge has increased fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students said they had a "principal" account shown to parents
One out of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a social network that keeps adults hidden.
A survey carried out on a number of 20,000 gym students revealed a rapid increase in “False Insta” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said that they own a "principal" and "clean" account that parents show, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13 - year - old daughter's secret account, observed the post of a teenager who asked to be “violent”.
According to research carried out by the Digital Awareness company in the United Kingdom and the association of directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) in independent schools, 40% of young people aged between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they have secret accounts.
HMC's director Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athlete Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected for the Director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletes Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, president, has described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activity to enjoy the vast experience that it has gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect in the entire athletes community in Scotland, Britain, as well as around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: "I am delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and to help how sports are being carried out in Scotland."
Athlete of American Nationality, who won the 200-400-metre trials at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, who was disabled after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
“ A month ago, ” he wrote on Twitter, “I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether I'll recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising comparing women with cows divides public opinion into the online environment
A breast pumping company has caused public opinion to be divided into the online environment with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the first silent and portable breast pump in the world”, the Elvie consumer technology company launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a barn full of cow hay on a song that includes such verses as: "Yes, I am wet, but I have no tail" and "if you have not noticed, these are not thirst, but my breasts."
The cooler continues: “I pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, extract milk from the girls.”
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them saying that it is taking out the " horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen from their children only a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/mother)
Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "A highly inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the commercial, a person claiming it was a "hilark" advertisement.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The claim is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny commercial that targets mothers who use the pump (sometimes at work or in the toilet) and who feel like “the veils. ”
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility to keep their children in their arms and even to get out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and designer at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such bold and challenging launch.
Compared with breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that will give the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pump gets on the front page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred secretly to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border every month remained relatively the same, largely because rhetoric and tough policies introduced by Trump administration caused the burden of placement of children to sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the customs and immigration authority (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), said in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we'll keep looking for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the child system, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children must be brought in court within one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for in the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead on the case by means of a video call, and not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and system reports in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are emphasized to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that the signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that “the situation will be properly managed”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been eradicated from their homes.
He also stated that Damascus will continue “this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories”.
In Syria there are approximately 2,000 military troops in the United States, which are mainly responsible for training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
Also in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem said that there are favourable conditions for returning to them and accused “some Western countries” of “prospering irrational fears”, which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return.”
"I have brought political influences into a problem that should be humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized area in the Idlib region to expel the last group of rebels created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale assault by Syrian forces, supported by Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target the jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links with the Al-Qaeda network and which will be "destroyed".
Staff of Mixture, the United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee made up of government members and opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the activities of the committee should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning on interference.
Why will Trump win the second term?
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-established in 2020, unless the removal procedure or the scandals will end his term of office as president earlier, which most of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case, there would be no doubt, “the most dramatic final of a term of president of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, the Fox News television station is followed on average by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" at MSNBC recorded a record of audiences, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the dramatic series "Reservation President" at ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and authoring the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
“He said, “Because it makes me laugh,” Scovell told me.
In chaos, fun is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be comprehensive and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the post is a luxury that can only allow privileged audiences.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of viewing the debate by an expert committee of how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fear, on Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar coat of arms ("an opulent item", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Trump's "anatomical parts".
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Most of what makes you feel like you're looking at a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the "Ass of the Morning" show, about the constantly changing distribution and the daily reversals caused by Trump (delaunching a dispute with the American professional football league, the praises brought to Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let yourself lose an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, there were 27 degrees and there was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
It could not dissipate from the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate's legal commission and decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember performing some shows from the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

Overwhelmed external financial resources for the closest interim elections associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a reinstatement of the electoral districts, which resulted from two mandate holders in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new district of Pittsburg has run the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another current mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which overlaps significantly with 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, and the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the republicans.
The course of the 17th new electoral district launched a competition in funding campaigns between important party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in special elections, of the highest audience, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function had been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20 point difference.
According to political commentators, democrats have an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalty of the state of El Salvador because of its understanding with China, but then gave up
The graduates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to call US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were taken against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for the control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and of the crimes thereof.
Since internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the return of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials at the top of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any examination of sanctions for El Salvador.
Now it is planned that Vice-President Mike Pence address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance that the administration grants to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports have been corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and who has also spoken on condition that the anonymity is preserved.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is guiding his investigation and investigating the existence of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia with regard to the attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, even when he is preparing to appear before the voters and possibly a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also valid for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we must make to all of us on both sides of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a state against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face some of these critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested the president's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with his role as president.
Rosenstein said the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the interim elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail after the lesson we learned at Prague.
My mother was a Jewish of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the table with swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Thursday, Rangers will be host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the impressive match of Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify as the G group of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow middleman Graham Dorrans to play this season until equal 2-2 to Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," 31-year-old player said.
"We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we won a point.
We probably could have signed up at the end, but overall, I think the equal was a fair result.
I think they were better at first, and we noticed better at second.
Thursday, it will again be an important evening for Europe.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because they have had a good result in the last game played. However, having support the supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and club changes, but the situation is better at this time.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind the last season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about this.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the Nationwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husband/wife.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You can't prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don't make your wishes known.
Work with the councillor and the family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser may be of real help in paying those costs.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can secure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: come to meet legal issues.
Get an authority on medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to monitor your health care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also take into account the exercise of power over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that a parent of yours of an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not all about the financial side alone. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it,” Martin asked.
“What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan for all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air gun while going home after a night in town.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in her chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as being “sufficient shootings”.
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
The wounds suffered did not put his life in danger, and the police appealed to witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Palu city of Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and expect the number of deaths to increase.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dojaka Regency, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after disaster occurred.
Here are a few key informations about Palu and Dojaka on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province in the center of the island of Sulawesi, which is at the end of a narrow golf course, on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Dojaka is a kingdom that extends on a coast with a surface of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming activities are the central point of the province's economy in the heart of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the Dojaka coast region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Dojaka have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dojaka.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western part of the Dojaka reign, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half being from Aceh.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of his female sex tried to call the police to sue for alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody, at Mat-Su unit, waiting for the trial, and is held on the basis of a non-securitized garage, worth $500, according to KTUU.
He presented himself to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “100% innocent” when he was asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin is facing three charges of class A crimes, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin's charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and holding a gun while being drunk in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered from after he was part of the Iraqi military.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude earthquake of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred across the central province of Sulawesi, located in the north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Socialisation networks circulate videos that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutor wishes the capital punishment for the terrorist attack suspect in New York City
The federal prosecutor in New York wants the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It seems that 30-year-old Saipov used a rented truck Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his way, in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the intent of requesting capital punishment, filed in the New York Southern District.
Both counts of charges may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges including eight criminal charges in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as "hate, cruel and depraved".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses for the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the New York Southern District.
The street, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbec citizen, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he was happy with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after watching ISIS group videos on his phone, according to the requisitioner.
Also, according to the cops, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded as innocent with regard to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenses in the office that represented Saipov, said that they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to implement the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence conviction plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is a member of the Conservative Party maintains that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians must "feel pressure" from Euroseptics, following a statement by a member of Parliament Theresa May who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out" so far if Farage was a secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge with which May faces the extremely divided camps was accentuated by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest, against the exit of the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister shall endeavour to ensure that his compromise plan, so-called the Chequers plan, is carried out appropriately, in the face of attacks by those who support the European Union's departure, those who want to remain in it, as well as the European Union's.
The Allies stressed that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of its consequences, and will force the Euroceptians and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Bone said during the pro-Brexit "Leave Means Leave" event in Solihull that he wanted "renunciation to the Czechers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were driven by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
Parliament's Conservative Member, the representative of Wellingborough, added: "I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Czechers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “I did not fight in the world war to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on the change of public opinion at the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party who supported Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people's voices.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither our street activists who support us in the first place at the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, he added: "Prim-Ministers who keep their office are those who keep their promises."
In the meeting, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be put in the situation of “feeling pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"He's trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let them do this."
In a message sent to enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We move the civil army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governed and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who claim to remain in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists raised banners written by the Conservative Party against Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that I can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a prank.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Massachusetts Democratic Senate spoke on Saturday about her future during a mayoral meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critic of President Donald Trump, is running to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the heart of speculation that she could defeat Trump by 2020.
The afternoon event in the Holyoke Saturday was the meeting with the number 36 voter citizens using the mayor's format since Trump took office as president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for “women to reach Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and this includes that in his head there is a woman.”
A suspect was arrested in the event of death causing the death of player Sims from the LSU team
Police from Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of death that caused the death of the player of Wayde Sims from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man from the images.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into custody by the police department East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the initial lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries on the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Finding his first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop in the box and left Hamilton in the group queue, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the box a shift later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after he made a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen began the race in the back of the carriage and was on the seventh place near the end of the first tour, even on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was in the lead for a large part of the race, looking at a quick finish and trying to get beyond Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Finally, he stopped boxing on tour number 44, but couldn't step up in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining in place four.
"It was a difficult day. Valteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me pass by.
And the team did an excellent job to win victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Horrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, in a rally on his insistences as she did not facilitate the "slip" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "wrong, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars," he said.
"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say that they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Remember?
When did I ask her if she facilitated the "slip" of the document?
Remember her answer? Did she say: umm..poftim?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
We did this?.No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "slipped" in September, but Feinstein denied that "slipping" occurred in her office.
"I haven't hidden the charges that look at Ford and I'm not the one that facilitated the "slip" of her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have hurt the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe wickedness, immorality, don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to get power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars team wins with 5-3 in front of Belfast Giants team
Patrick Dwyer wrote two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Dundee Star team paid for the loss of Friday of the Elite League, winning in front of the Giants team in Belfast in the return match on Saturday, with the score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled the score before Dwyer brought Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equalled the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat of this season's Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had recovered land by defeating the Dundee team on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening show started in the fourth minute, respectively, on 3:35, from a step of Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan brought back the host team into play in minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie an opportunity to score for an equal score in minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he entered his second goal at the end of the first round.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again matched an impressive goal in the minute 27:37.
Later, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that game, thus ensuring the team's climb to place 5 in the ranking, about the middle of the last one.
Giants team, who has now lost four of the last five games, will be, Friday, host to Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane of hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There were several strong reprisals in the area and many people are stuck under the rest of the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Générale refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was rocking strongly.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the air navigation service provider in Indonesia said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached the Palu.
"We are distressed by this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency saying that access is limited in the cities of Donjaka, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, because many victims are still under ruins and we have not had access to many of them," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The valleys with a height of up to six meters devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday there will be a common burial.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said for Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimals are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to offer help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which fought with more than 550 dead men.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now said that a person is missing, after earlier it said that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger is missing from Saturday afternoon.
He also mentioned that he was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land on Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States Air Company and Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses think the plane has crossed the end of the track.
American national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the breeze, and to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the escorts on board panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. naval forces said that the sailors working nearby for the renovation of a landing jumped in hand, using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to 30 meters below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents by air companies registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor closed his plea with regard to the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his cell phone records to put the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and his victim Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, which was contrary to his previous statements, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "lied, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsequence was that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they have been known for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Telllis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way that this kind of music is seen, using some songs with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social problems, as it initially did.
They want to go back to their origins and make the hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fleees and Common in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more person of color?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she has received a "raist" text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminating reasons after she accidentally received a text message from her mother, in which she complained that she was still “a person of color”.
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she had sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his dissatisfaction when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colourful when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
“NUUUUUU! A PERSON OF COLOURS” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gaffe, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, failed to meet her duties properly and that she expected to receive a Philippine nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and requests the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period during which she had to live with them and perform her activity, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that no such thing is done," she said on Friday for the Post newspaper, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her a wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been wrong about, even if by mistake?
Newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process as an "extortion" action, Plasco said that his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really want to take revenge on a person under such circumstances?
Not doing that," added the bank investor.
While the process is under way, public opinion has accused the couple on social networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have given evidence.
The editors of Paddington's story feared that readers would not be able to identify with a bear who speaks, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her acceptance of the book, said the following about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
He also said that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was a "sweetness" after he died last year.
On Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
"He was quite a quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, although it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give him the credit of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was transported quickly to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for no reason.
"It doesn't sound often to tell me it's very serious and doesn't think it's going to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say good-bye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors so her heart continues to pump blood began to decrease and come out of her body.
He died a little while ago and the organs began to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that happened.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperuse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded a plane along with other passengers, who didn't know what he was going through.
"He didn't know anybody," she said.
"I kept my head down and tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two mourning women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says his son was to be a promising chef with a molluscist smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your disposition."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said: "I keep thinking about you will have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to pass on to people that I can call on someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' oldest friend, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that his death was a terrible trauma to them, but she must overcome it: “It caused great pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake, as a result of the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – a limited and small-scale investigation – we could have little unity,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the commission was about to “disintegrate,” behind a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their retention is entirely due to the time factor.
There are only five weeks left until the 6 November elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want to win at the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean parliamentman.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the key factors were the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges levied by those who transported illegal persons across the border.
The Phenian did not make any public comment.
A vast majority of Northern fugitives are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives rather illegal migrants than refugees and often returns forced.
Relations between North and South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a number of discussions that were the subject of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of a lack of progress ever since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, we won't be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "steric", saying he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Chamber of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "histeric" and said that his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of the fact that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "sterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's legal commission, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he would have harassed Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he almost screamed and lost his voice because of the emotions, while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him “a grossly coordinated assassination of character”, organized by the angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when she was asked whether she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it would be confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which you are now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal in Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings Kavanaugh ignored the question whether it would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect to say, ‘How wonderful!’, Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatric, it's months and years of accumulated rage and can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in executive capacity, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a great thing."
Tears are allowed for the outsourcing of anger, partly because they are understood fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was caught by the head of an older woman, a cold direction towards which I always felt a little afraid, and went to the stairwell house.
"He must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be happy that they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extra-conjugal relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason to run for even her presidency.
“It wasn’t a very well - thought - out decision, ” she says, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as Snow and the seven dwarfs".
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind fundraising and swore she wouldn't be in the race if she couldn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given them to the $1,000 men, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get reductions?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by the emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to collect money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of the emotions .
“You would have said that I have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the reaction of the press to her.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my funeral stone.
"Did he cry?"
How can the Beijing trade war between the United States and China be beneficial?
Saves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although it seems to be a long way to end, disputes between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively applying taxes for half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing took revenge every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10% for US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its requests, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be much too humiliating for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays cards well, US trade war pressures could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could lead to economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been anticipated so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security (Center for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the conditions on the site are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things will return to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 cup after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of the city of Paris, France.
The United States now registered the sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came first after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points, necessary to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to the third hair at the 16th hole, giving up Francesco Molinari's match.
Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the repairs, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current format of the tournament since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 holes in front of the latest player in the European team ranking, Thorbjorn Olsen, Denmark.
First-place player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at holes 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which was probably his last match in the Ryder cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most winners, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win again the cup.
It's teamwork and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, excitedly after European victory.
He handed over the flag to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being exceeded only by Jack Nicklaus.
The entire weekend, the American team put a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the entire tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the American team said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they have even tried their best.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've been having a bum fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us."
