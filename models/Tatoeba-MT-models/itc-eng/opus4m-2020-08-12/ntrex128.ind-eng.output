The members of the Majelis (AM) Welsh worry if they ‘look like a muppet doll’.
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that they should be referred to as MWPs.
This arose because there was a plan to turn the name of the Majestic into Parliament Welsh.
The AMs all over the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite concern.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's called Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "unsatisfied" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open thinking" about name changes, but judging that this was a blast of the MWP abbreviation to be Muppet.
In this context your letter in Welsh is spoken as a u letter in English Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Council, which is currently establishing laws to introduce the name, says: "The last decision on any explanation of the name for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
Wales' decision 2017 gave the Wales Council a power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known to have broad support for referencing the conference as Parliament Welsh.
Regarding the AM problem, the Commission prefers WMPs (Wellsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but MWP options get the most support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to have made alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could cut off the chief, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the legislative plans for the change within a few weeks.
These reforms will include other changes on how to work, including rules that are disqualified for AMs and committee system designs.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the invitations.
The Macedonians went to give a vote in the referendum on the change of the country's name
The voter will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the North Macedonian Republic.
The vote was held in an effort to resolve disputes for a decade with Greek neighbors, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring northern country indicates a confession to her territory and has repeatedly rejected the offer of membership of the European Union and NATO.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice-voting opponent for name change, has said he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change of name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St.Martin's bells did not intertwine when the churches in Harlem were in trouble
"Historically, the parents I'm talking about say there was a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, none."
He said that all those bars were missing could be understood.
"People socialize in another way" right now, he said.
"Bar is no longer the living room of the community around where people regularly visit him."
As well with the church, he was concerned that money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced with the apartment building with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the holy places around it.
"The majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and so it will speed up the day when these churches close at the same time because there is no way for those who move to the condominium to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white church before Harlem became the metropolitan city of black - and - black metropolitan communities in 1870, St. Martin, a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that has served in the surrounding area has taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black church under the leadership of President John Howard, who led a brilliant shopkeeper on 125th, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The 1939 fire caused the building to collapse, but when President Johnson’s parish people planned to rebuild, they built a tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his replacement in St. Martin proudly called the tower bell as "the bell of the poor people"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another title: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind who switched to sound a larger tower bell in the 18 years ago Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin for the past few months is a complicated history of architecture and contractors, some brought by the leaders of the public church, and others brought by the episcopal ministry.
The vestry - the governing body, formed by public leaders - wrote a letter to the bishops in July with concern that the "will try to burden the costs" on the vestry parties, even though vestry was not involved in the architectural recruiting and contractors that were sent by the vestry.
Some parishioners complain about the lack of transparency of the party.
Sharks injured 13-year-olds in lobster dives in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobster in California at the opening of the lobster season, the task of an officer.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the Incinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowed together to help draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill after he caught lobster, but then he "saw" that the boy screamed, "I'm biting!
I'm bitten!'
His entire skeletal bone is torn apart," Hammel said that he realized when he had taken the child.
"I screamed at everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flew to the Rady Son's Hospital in San Diego where he was handled in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in the media conference that a shark had seen in that area a week earlier, but it was classified as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim had a severe wound to the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plan broke down the English beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with kiosks-kios beauty toserba style managed by the assistant specialists.
As part of the substantial encouragement to the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household equipment down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores all over the country and will be developed into more shops next year if it proved successful.
Investing in beauty is a hunt for supermarkets to use racks that used to be used as a TV dock, microwave, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the supply of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The series of brands that currently exist start with L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with a blushing area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also reopened its range of masks so that most of the products would be friendly to vegans - things that are increasingly interested in young farmers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume growers will test the deal at two scientific stores, the first opened in Croydon.
Online shopping and switching the purchase of daily food needs in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of sciencebury, has said that the gerais will become more and more like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back those like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and without food.
Sciencebury has placed the Argos gerais in hundreds of shops and has also introduced some Habitat gerais since they bought those two waralabas two years ago, which she said has supported daily food sales and made a more lucrative claim.
The previous supermarket effort to renew the beauty and pharmaceutical department ended with failure.
Sciencebury tested the statue effort with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a conflict about how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
New strategy emerged after the sale of 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding various fancy leather care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sciencebury, said: "We've changed the look and nuance on the beauty kiosks to fix the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand's array is designed so that according to all needs, the attractive environment and the convenient location points out that we are currently an attractive destination that challenges the long-running way of shopping."
Peter Jones "grow" after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones went ‘worry’ after the TV carrier Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a living-style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the brand of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
This couple's business is similar to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old bringer uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' star" Den, Petes Jones is madly attracted at the last moments, from their lucrative lifestyle business -- to focus on his bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was so "whispered" when the golden girl admitted during the exciting meeting on Tuesday at her government office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deal-- worth up to £1.5 million--it means she no longer had enough time to devote herself to the brand of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Pltrow's Goop brand and expected to double Willoughby's worth of £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says, "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would keep him going for decades to come.
His decision to back down makes everyone involved very surprised.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the travel of this Morning, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can cost the company up to millions of dollars because of massive investment in product form, from pillows and candles to clothes and household equipment, and there is potential for further postponement.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship relationship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and Tara Capp's wife for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined the leader in March.
These couples are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand-name ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV carrier named I'm A Celebrity.
A fellow close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Seriously ‘and then we fell in love’
He's joking about the criticism he's going to get from the news media because he makes comments that some people consider to be "non-presidential" and has been very positive against the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said it was his "new reader" with a funny voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea's inclusion.
But the negotiations for inuklinization have been stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the highest diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders on Saturday's General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea did not see any "appropriate responses" from the United States against the initial movement of North Korea's weapons.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions to guard against pressure.
Trump's more optimistic in his speech sequence.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight with North Korea.
Millions will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing his relationship with Kim had brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he's defending his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"Very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this rough arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and the Earthquake Destroyed an Island, Killed Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok are homeless, there is no declaration of national disaster, as a precondition for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so this is a bit challenging," Mrs. Consumer said.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, it's still not sure if foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesperson for national disaster relief, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in the Pallu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute aid.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared for natural anger.
While the tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a public sight on the other shoreline.
There was no tsunami warning siren in the Pallu, despite the warning of danger, it was likely to have contributed to the existence of life victims.
At the best times, travel between many Indonesian islands was challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The shelter that had been placed in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is on their way to the Pallu, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to broken Indonesian infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on building roads and railway tracks.
But there was a shortage of funds disrupting Father Joko’s government as he faced an election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from the still prevailing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim members of the majority had embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian mobs fought on the streets, using dams, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge put in a floating goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea at the Premier League with a score in a minute at 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it into a distant pole.
The ball rolled high over the gutter when the ball rolled to the right corner over the net.
The ball finally fell past the Arrizabalaga which jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just do the kick."
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 at the first half after Belgium's original player Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
Attacker The Blue gave Mateo Kovacic bait to the game, before rotating near the middle line and running fast into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gives bait and runs in the middle line.
He then made the perfect kick, led Hazard to the gutter.
Hazard managed to get past the opponent's rendezvous and kick the ball into the corner of the gutter with the kicks left, pass the Kiper Liverpool Alisson Becker.

The death of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
Death toll on an earthquake and an Indonesian tsunami had increased to 832, bringing the country’s disaster agency to the fore on Sunday morning.
Many are reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 - scale earthquake of the Richter on Friday and trigger 20 - foot - high waves, says Sutopo Purwo, an agency speaker in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which is home to more than 380,000 people, is filled with the ruins of a collapsed building.
The police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Murder investigation has been carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Road, at 7:55 a.m. with a few stab wounds, while a 32 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigator is still at the beginning but I ask everyone around John's road in Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I also drew everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might record something on the dasbor cameras to contact us because they might have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt sure that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on as the police have said, they're in the process of telling the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
That man can't say anything when he finds out what happened.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer is hearing from someone that all areas are now being treated as a scene.
A woman showed up at the scene in tears.
He always repeats ‘this is really terrible’.
By 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stand in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Parlemen Cromwell became the last memorial of ‘recovery of history’.
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of alla-Taliban against many British cultural and religious artifacts made by the fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "seeking to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "It cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that the figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster palace will be targeted.
The British brother's iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell descendants would be sacrificed for Thomas' ancestor action in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft was a 19th-century evidence of opinion and part of historiography of a figure that still believed many still deserve to celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in which case of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a fully accurate representation, it's still the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
which is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is a known individual representing one side of the difference.
He is the Lord of protection."
Killer Pigs Punishing Chinese Farmers Until Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name of his trademark "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-stained artery near a pig cage in the Liupanshui district market of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject a vaccine to the pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai Province, China.
She was reported to have gone with her cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the pig stable door near him was opened.
He said that in the pig cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the male pig weighing 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until he died, based on the report.
"Betic my cousin bleeds and destroys," said the cousin who was known for the "Wu" marga, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed that man was neither of Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Eventing News that the pig was already locked up to prevent anyone from attacking, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the reported market authority are negotiating compensation for his death.
Though rare, pig assault cases against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be badly injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife was afraid and expelled the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the scent of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing games.
They're biters, so curious... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storms carry widespread rain to the west of the United States.
As expected, the Rosa storm was weakened when it moved above the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause a flood throughout Mexico’s northern and western parts of the United States to come a few days.
Rosa has a wind at 85 mph, storm category 1, starting at 5 a.m. on Sunday time East Region, and is 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may be moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Palung began to form on the Pacific Ocean and moved east, to the West Coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching swamps will create massive rains that extend in the West Power for a few days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause the rainfall to close to 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
An estimated 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 cm] of rain falls in some parts of Western Day, especially in most of Arizona.
The Floods are likely to occur with conditions that are rapidly deteriorating because of the widespread tropical rains.
Very unprovoked to explore the desert by walking because of the tropical rain threat.
Heavy rains can cause the abyss to turn into a violent river and may cause the storm to bring on strong local winds and dust.
Closer palungs will cause local heavy rains to part of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall over half an inch is enough to allow, which can cause small debris to flow and the road becomes slippery.
It'll be the first rain in that region in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before it becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes throughout the U.S. when the Arctic gets colder, but tropical areas remain warm enough.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in the temperature in a short distance.
There is an accurate example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. midweek.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer heat will be formed and spread again.
Most of the U.S. region in the middle and east is expected to start warm in October at a speed of 80s from the South Plain to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast showed a high opportunity for temperature above average for the U.S. east until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the upcoming Court of Justice of Great Britain Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexual violence that was suspected in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continues, with publishers interrupting the regular event to announce an unexpected event on the last minute of Friday: An agreement planned by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charge.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was getting drunk and trying to take off her clothes at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in her fiery testimony, said that she was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company calculates the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the number of people who saw him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of spectators that almost match the football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which has been very supportive of Kavanaugh's show, is superior to all networks with an average of 5.69 million audiences during the trial all day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranks second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The seeker stays high after the trial.
Flake was a key player in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being screamed at by a taste show when he tried to ride the elevator to the Justice Committee.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he's targeted maki, broadcasted directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he told the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."
Flake said that his office had made a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee.
Cable TV and broadcast network all line up live a few hours later, when the Justice Committee will choose to file a Kavanaugh call to the whole Senate for vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the future candidate for a week, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been confirmed by some conversation with his friend, Senator Democracy Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and some senator after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, since it's clear that the Republican party won't have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'political play' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of playing politics with the future of Britain and damaging national interests, of his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with a Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews showing it on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about England and the EU that had to collect one another's tariffs was "the whole doesn't make sense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police caught Dyteon Simpson's suspect in the death of an LSU player.
Police have caught a suspect in a fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and in prison for murder level two, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
The clerk released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found those glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson DNA on those items, WAFB CBS affiliates reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he claimed he had made a fatal shot at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The Coroner Parish office of Baton Rouge East released an earlier report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department is grateful for the bailiff's work in Louisiana State Police, state police criminal lab, Southern University police and citizens around to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Athletic director LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement officer for "delict and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 then.
Six feet tall lives in Baton Rouge, where her father, Wayne also plays basketball for LSU.
He's on average 5.6 and he's up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "destructed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," says Wade.
The volcano tears down the ashes in Mexico City
The ashes that come out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern area around Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the gravel and registered there were 183 gas and ash emissions within a period of more than 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several times and was shaking.
Pictures in social media show thin layers of gray that stick to the front glass of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity on the volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the city capital since the 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in mid-September 2017.
This Fire Mountain is known as "Don Goyo" that has been active since 1994.
The police broke up with Catalan separatist approaching independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-freedom demonstration against anti-Houran police, and when thousands joined with a demonstration of competition to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on separation.
A pro-separatist group of masked masks held by anti-hara police throwing them with eggs and throwing powder paint, thus creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that will usually be filled by tourists.
The dispute also occurred later that day with police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For a few hours the pro-freedom groups shouted "Don't forget, no forgiveness" in front of the show of the workers' union shouting, "Long live Spanish."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tension remains high in this self - oriented region, one year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan separatist.
The voters prefer to be free, even though the number of voters is low with those who oppose self - separation and most of them boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the polling at the GST throughout the region in sharp clashes.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry about being able to choose, but now we're trapped," he says.
Although successful in gaining vital victory even a little in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro- independence parties have fought to maintain this moment of the year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded protests with his cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned for pre-trials since last year, announced that he was going to run for election next year's European Parliament.
"Standing up as candidates for European elections is the best way to threaten rejection in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car

The Gol printed by Menga has given the Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly's first goal is for Livingston to ensure the victory
Livingston’s victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard out of his position as the manager of the Iboox club, on his second defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equal to the hibernian in the second order.
The side of Gerrard remains without victory in this season's premiership and facing the leaders of Hearts who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers invited you to Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeatable record in division into six games, while Holt's coach's head is still winning defeat since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston lost opportunity against a sloppy guest team
The Holt team should have been a long way off before they scored goals, with the accuracy of those who gave Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort to miss across the gutter's face, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after launching in and facing Craig Halkett's veil across the gutter.
Mr. Home was satisfied to let Rangers play superior at first, knowing that they could make it difficult for the visiting team to find out about a dead ball.
And that's how to produce a very important goal.
Rangers of free kicking and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in helping Menga, who got a turn and scored goals from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers has dominated the rule but realizes that the host's defense cannot be breached and that Liam Kelly's kiper is completely undisturbed,
The pattern continued until the second round, although Alfredo Morelos managed to catch up with Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was harassed by the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow were cut off by the other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continues to come to the Livingston glove and constantly avoided, while two claims penalty - after Halkett's challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball - denied.
‘Feminomenal’ from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaska Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they were amazing, continuing to go beyond hope on this ever - increasing track.
Their style of playing and their personal almost didn't change since they came back to the board, but large credit must be given to Holt for how he strengthened the team since he arrived.
He has so many giants.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading a well-organized defense, while Minga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less than good - only once they could break the formation of the side of the house - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan was given a mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue space on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
They argued about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons to prevent the crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan prosthetics - many of them Kurds - also spoke, challenged both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in that country.
The resistance protest describes the opposition to the existence of a comedian who was hailed as a hero by some German Turkishs and criticized as a dictator by others.
Breakdown on the Deptford highway: Bike driver died in crash with the car
A bike driver died in a crash involving a car in London.
A crash took place near the three Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and the paramedics had come, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place months after another bike driver died in a runoff on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said that the officers were trying to identify the man and report to his family.

Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in huru-hara
Six wardens were injured in a riot in a man's prison with a strict guard, the department declared.
The chaos arose in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m. BST (GMT+0100) on Sundays and is still going on.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been forced to handle the riot, which involves eight prisoners and happens on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene because of the slight wounds on the face.
One prison speaker said, "The specially trained lens has been forced to deal with an incident that is taking place in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was treated at the hospital after the attack by an inmate.
And in October last year, anti-huru-hara officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots where an air force was attacked with a bile ball.
Pink Storm Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by Flood
Tropical depression that struck Arizona rarely occurs, but that is what is likely to happen early next week because of the remaining traces of energy storms across the western desert, leading to the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the flooding on Monday and Tuesday for the West Arizona region to South Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on the twitter that there are only ten tropical mice capable of causing tropical storms or depression in 200 miles of Phoenix territory since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles of AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center's device is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount of 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Another western desert area, including central Rockies and Great Basin, is likely to be 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of isolations reaching up to 4 inches.
For those in the free floating area, Rosa’s rain may have been a blessing because the area was dry.
Although floodwaters are a serious problem, these parts of the rainy season are likely to benefit because the western region is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. United States Drought Watcher, only about 40 percent of Arizona's territory has had a minor extreme drought, the second highest category,"weather.com reported.
First, the road through the Rosa storm leads to the land across the California River near Mexico.
Rosa, still in the storm power on Sunday morning at 85 miles an hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm met with the cooler watery area in the Pacific and that was why it had weakened its power.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with the power of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain heat may be high in parts of Mexico, leading to high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is estimated to be channelling the California Baja region to the western area of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and south into the middle of Tuesday night.
"The main risk that may have been caused by the storm of Rosa or the rest of the storm is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the western area of Sonora, and the U.S., the western desert area of the U.S.." National Storm Center (NHC) states.
The rain is expected to cause the threat of flooding and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and there is a landslide in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest four murder suspects
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The young man was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a stable condition.
One 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in the area of Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
Officers have been calling anyone who might have the video footage on his cell phone to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘receives hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the vicious and shameful democratic party plot," Trump said on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the process of recalculation
Kavanaugh's testimony before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual violence to him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "The Americans saw the intelligence and the quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to strengthen someone who has the most perfect legal thinking in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he told the West Virginia supporter crowd.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's challenger when discussing the importance of Republican participation in mid-election.
"Five weeks before it happened one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really freaking out," he said.
"That's why I went there, fighting for a great future.
Trump argued that democracy was on a mission to "fight and block."
The procedure for the first vote in the Senate at the level of the Kavanaugh is expected to be carried out at the latest Friday, an assistant senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with increasing numbers of victims
At least 384 people died, many were killed when giant waves hit the beach, when earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a six - foot [6 m] - high wave destroyed the beach at dusk, caused a lot of death and destroyed everything it passed.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 power.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activity on the beach and they were not running away, so they became a victim," Sutope Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Disaster Relief Service (BNPB) said at the time of his death in Jakarta.
"The tsunami doesn't come alone, it drags cars, wood, houses, hangs everything on land," says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami has crossed the sea at 800 mph (497 mph) before crossing the shoreline.
Some climb a tree to save themselves from the tsunami and survive, she says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in the Palu.
The BNPB’s photo of air shows many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were bent and amputated, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquake shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in areas of 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Board (PPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted at the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb blast that was dropped in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the tip of a long narrow bay, can be said to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage that happened as "extensive" and states that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under ruined buildings, he said, adding that there were 540 victims injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be greater along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of the Palu, a region called Dojaka, which is closer to the earthquake center.
Communication's really paralyzed with no information from Dojaga, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are on their way to a disaster-affected region.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The instance that Saturday received much criticism because it did not inform the public that there was a tsunami that had spread, although the authorities had said that the waves had already crashed at the time the warning had been issued.
An amateur record distributed in social media shows a man on the floor of a building sounding warning with panic that there will be a tsunami approaching, towards those on the streets below it.
In the minutes of the water roll over the beach, the building and the car are inflated.
Reuters can't immediately prove the realisation of the tape.
The earthquake and tsunamis were the biggest causes of the electric blackout that engulfed communications around the Palus, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already started sending cargo ships with help from Jakarta and other cities, says the authorities, but refugees still need more food and other needs.
The airport has been reopened only to channel the aid effort and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center at the Pallu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami Victim increased by 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Dojaga have managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where the officials are sheltered in the wooden tent built in their office yards, on their way they have passed through various areas of detail, says Mr Doseba.
"They tell me that they have seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's so terrible.
Even as relief groups begin to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of them complain about the lack of restraint against skilled foreign volunteers who are about to leave for the Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financing, aid and energy from outside the country can only begin to be channeled if disaster areas have been officially declared a national disaster region.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, OK, it's a national disaster," we can receive international help, but there's no such status."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami occurred in the Palu, the friends and families of the lost victims still hoped that the people they loved would be part of the miracle that would repair the course of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of the house.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman stuck under the debris for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesian National Paralymist coach, has been a coach for two missing paralymists, who eventually followed the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandage, are his followers.
"As a senior in paralysing, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told me how after the news about the Roa-Roa Hotel that was destroyed left around the paralysing community, he despairedly sent whatsApp message to the Palu competitors, who also attended a celebration on the beach.
Even so, all the messages, only got one mark of gray, not two blues.
"I think it means unsent messages," he said.

West Kanye: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announced the change of name over Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one that was formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been named Ye for some time and uses that name as its eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before his performance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform at the show, which was canceled because of "emotional grounds," said the show creator.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had religious significance.
"I believe 'ye' is the common word used in the Bible, and it means 'You',' says West at the beginning of this year, discussing the album title with the Big Boy Radio publisher.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our evils, our confusion, all.
It's more like our real self-reliance."
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator West, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connection and letters.
President Mexico, AMLO, swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
The elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military power against civil society by the 50th anniversary warning of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to push the Mexicans."
Troops fired fire at peaceful demonstration activity on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the left wing students were moving to plant their roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies for those in college and opening more universities for free.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education motivated young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. is supposed to double the A.I. funding.
Since China is more active in the matter of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding that will be used for research in the field, the words investors and A2 Kai-Fu Lee practice, which has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. was completely lacking in formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aimed at becoming number one in the innovation of the year 2030.
"The duplication of AI research funding is a good start, given that all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Double funding could double the chance that the next major AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Sinevation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and then he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and Google branch president of China.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's technological competition earlier as a Robotics Challenge for the Final Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win a prize from the government, says Lee.
"It's not the Chinese that takes over the academics; it's the company," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring high-tech people from universities for the last few years of AI research.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to support Al's efforts.
"I think the green card can be offered automatically to the PHD holder in the AI field," he said.
China’s National Council issued the plan for the next Generation’s Smart Development in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions just like the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but lower academic quality in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Defense Department developed the Joint Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Building Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announces a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, recent DARPA has invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Manufacturing Intelligence did not see any further steps for months.
Macedonians make a vote in the realm of national name changes
The Macedonians were voting on Sunday to decide to change the name of the country into the "North Macedonian Republic," an action that would resolve disputes for a decade with Greece that had challenged its membership offer to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greek, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of its neighboring northern country represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has forbidden it to join NATO and the European Union.
Both sides of the government reached a deal in June on the basis of a new name, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most of the ethnic population of Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign has generated doubts whether the election results can reach the minimum of 50 percent needed to be declared legitimate.
The question on the soundtrack reads: "Do you agree to NATO and the EU by accepting any agreement with Greece?"
Supporter of name changes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying to get permission into bodies such as the Union of Europe and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the younger generations of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, quite a number of members of parliament said that they would obey the results of the vote to make decisions.
The change of names requires a two-by-three vote in parliament.
The state election commission says there's no report of a breach until 1 pm.
However, it turns out that the vote was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the final parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters registered gave their voice mail.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjoise Tanevski, 62, a picker in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their ballots for the general election in Macedonia in a range of national names that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov has prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents made by those who will boycott the pick-up.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join in honorably, not through the waiter door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investments needed for Macedonia, which had an unemployment level of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most people will approve it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice mail.
He said the result of "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
Other polls, arranged by the Telma Macedonian TV station, found that there were 57 percent of the respondents who were planning to join their voices on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they'd choose yes.
To achieve such a successful vote, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the polling will represent the rejection of the first policy against the pro-Barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is exploring the entire Brighton defense to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were assigned as Brighton's defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that victory look so easy on his score in the 65th.
Argentine attacker received an operand in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three men defending Brighton, before his inept entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green boots.
He spins past one defender before running ahead of some other rivals at the edge of Brighton's glove.
Then he went to his left, to Sterling.
The British front wave used his first kick from the gaugane to operate the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gaugane.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola city manager to reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling's the one who gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the First League fight.
That gol happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far inside Brighton's territory at the game.
He operated the ball with a long, glaring kick through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a bit of a ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blue's front swirling the ball towards the gutter right before the ball launched out of the border.

Scherzer wants to send spoiler versus Rockies
With its Nationals elimination from the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another game.
But Scherzer who is too competitive hopes to be able to top Colorado Rockies at the game on Sunday, but only if there's still a playoff involvement for Rockies, which is superior in one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies had at least won a place after winning a wild-card game against Nationals with 5-2 scores on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Even though we play without winning, at least we can figure out the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of audiences and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How come I don't want to compete in a game like that?"
Nationals hasn't announced the opening game for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start a strike for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and started a weekly game that was usually used to rest.
Pitcher right hand Washington is 18-7 score water with average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President is referring to the situation in which the Supreme Court is elected, Brett Kavanaugh, when he talks about the importance of the Republican public vote in the middle of the election.
"All our efforts have been put at risk in November.
Five weeks before it was the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I fought everywhere for an extraordinary candidate," he says.
Trump continues, "You've seen a radical democracy group that's so awful, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see the crime, their spite.
They do not care who they hurt.
Democracy, he says, is on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, "the Democrats call it anger and evil and evil and untrustworthy."
Paul referred to the Senate Senate of Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Justice Committee by mentioning its name, which was met with intense scrutiny by its listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it-- it's a very bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
Now be an intolerance to anyone who's raising his mind.
When the Momentum activist at the local party gave me a voice to protest at me, it wasn't surprising.
Furthermore, I was in the last order of the Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we spoke out of opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan got the same treatment because he stood up for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the chaos criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the ironic issue that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to the previous leader.
The announcement for the meeting of the East Nottingham workers on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years, I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, a meeting of the General Committee on Friday night exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, indeed, it has begun.
The differences in opinion in the labor party are becoming more and more unrelenting and each opinion is judged by the authority of the party.
It started immediately after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I thought I would be able to share the same political views, starting to expect me to turn around and accept the position I had never accepted before - both in national security and in the single European Union market.
Whenever I speak openly--and no matter what I say--then after that there will be a search in social media that calls for the cancellation of the show, defamation of central politics, tell me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me who had it.
Of course, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never escape.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is the level of abuse that has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer in larger churches and with every motion "untrusted" or transforming the selection of party rules into more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that moved me to keep under my head, not to mention too much opinion, and then I'll say, "All right."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by thatcher’s government decoration that caused my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have tried to fight better public services for those who really need it — both as local counsellors and ministers in government.
I never hid my political action, including in the last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham would question my policy position and things that I do not agree with in current leadership.
For those who encourage a motion on Friday, what I can say is that when the country moves quickly towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr ascended to top position
The last two trials may have been a little misleading at the end, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the highly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they're in the top sequence, the only unbeatable side of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to make the best of the opportunity, which made the team host and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeatable so we feel happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The appreciation for Ayr, they're better at taking a chance than we do."
Grant Anderson's experiment in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Clima, put Ayr in front, but yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given at the game by Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot sabotaged unconverted experiments.
Climo loosened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in mid-time, he scored a goal and then did a single attempt to make Ayr score to be 17-5 at break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's experiment changed by Baggot, reduced the chance up to five points.
And then there's a long break because Ruaridh Knott has been seriously injured, driven out, and since the start of the game, Ayr has been running faster than Stafford McDowall's experiment, changed by Climate.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of hard pressure.
Mr. Home has come back to play, but by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he slipped Clima without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured Ayr that went ahead.
Climate was replaced, as it was again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe did the kick-off of the glove and thwarted the fifth effort of Gregor Henry's operator.
Still Game Star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Star Still Game Kieran looks ready to move the route to the service industry after it was previously known that he was appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis at the BBC's popular event, which is flagged and starred with an old comedian, Greg Hemphil.
The couple had announced that the ninth series to come was the last episode, and Kiernan apparently planned to drive the broadcast directly after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun narrative suggested that Kiernan was trying to be involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘ The sea is ours: Bolivia, that is surrounded by land, is hoping that the court will reopen its course in the Pacific.
Sailors were patrolling at the large platoon base located in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Navy Camp from Titicaca to Amazon was powered by a motorcycle: "The sea is our rightful right.
To be resurrected is an obligation."
Passing through Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict is still clear - as the desire to once again penetrate the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, for Bolivia is waiting for a court ruling on October 1 after the five - year talks.
"Bolivia has moments, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly a positive hope for results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who are going to watch the ICJ trial on a wide screen across the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that - after several decades of fearsome talks - Chile must negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian president of the Bolivian government who is charismatic in the face of the controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support for the trial on Monday.
"We've been very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court cannot decide what Bolivia wants - and that would only change a little if that were possible.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body does not have the power to hand over Chile, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of the possible confrontation.
That the ICJ statement came only six months after the final argument that had been heard, which indicated the case "uncomplex," says Paz Zárate, an international expert in Chile.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years, it may even be a decline.
"Earth access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he says.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good practices of remaining Chileans, she says.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will continue to argue, but it will be very difficult to continue the discussion after this.
Since 1962, the two countries had not exchanged ambassadorial status with each other.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government representative of Den Haag rejects the idea of early decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open up an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict of opinion with profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of the most famous Latin American presidents-uses maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Foreign Minister North Korean Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never remove nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the U.N. General Congregation.
He mentioned that the United States carried out the deal that was made at the meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comment appeared when Secretary of the U.S. State Mike Pompeo was almost starting nuclear diplomacy that had been destroyed for more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said only a "one dream" that continuing sanctions and U.S. rejection of the declaration of the settlement of the Korean War would make North Korea give up.
Washington is on the lookout to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making efforts to limit the armed forces first.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there's a doubt that Pyongyang's serious about the recognition of the arms warehouse that the country has become the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion show shows a lot of new head cover collections to the main road near you
If you want to multiply a collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designed a series of large-sized caps for their SS19 collection on the stage of a fashion show with the ghastly style held in Paris Fashion Week.
A truly impractical hat has wiped out Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing creations that are eye-catching on the craft stage.
The highlight of Valentino is a cream hat that is adorned with a broad edge of the hair tray covering the head of the model.
Large - size accessories include diamonds, witch hats, and even a dwarf, but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange mask-and right through Halloween.
A lot of colored masks whose lips have been sewn and similar to Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creation that resembles scuba diving equipment is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep going through the collection of that width mode-- then you're just getting excited.
Moderators expected that the large hat collection would be placed on the main road near you.
The big hats became a very running train in ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a width of two feet was seen to be worn all including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a very impractical hat of social media makes a huge creation on the shorebeds of the large straws almost equal to the swimwear - used with a model of swimming.
The raffia bag that was burned, cut with raffia on the edge with a white leather strap, is an outstanding thing from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and a beach bag arrive on the main road for next summer--because designer has made a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the request for that big accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland's private school keeps track of academic achievement, and this continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test result, which is being strengthened by every student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland School Council (SCIS) are trying hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
The private school aims to prepare its students for further and higher education, their career choices, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see the modern language continue to be the subject of popular choice and desired in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, your words will come into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then you will enter his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we can see that language is the top position of the binding table with the highest graduation value in the independent school.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students get A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 schools of SCIS that showed that 72 percent of students earned the A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also got the A.
This indicates that the school itself in Scotland supports foreign language as an important skill that will definitely be needed by children and teenagers in the future.
Currently, languages, as an eye-to-eye choice, are held in the same standard as the STEM study (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Labour and Skills Service in 2014 found that of some reasons why employers have to continue to struggle to fill the opportunities, 17 percent why is less of the language skills.
Thus, more and more language skills are encouraged to prepare teenagers for their upcoming careers.
As ever - increasing opportunities to work in a language field increased, this skill is vital in a global society.
Whatever a person's career choices, if they've learned the second language, in the future they'll feel real benefits because they have the skills of this kind of life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will automatically make a superior multilingual in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov at over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign language well enough to do French and conversation as the only language spoken in two percent digits, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education for children now is important for the moment.
Having a multi-language capacity, especially the country language with a growing economy, will divide the children with a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach English that is considered to be the most important language in the years ahead, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in private schools, with the teaching staff that are experts in this field.
Scotland's own school is designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and exchange them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever future events may occur.
It cannot be ruled out that at this time, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, the modern language must be considered "international communication skills."
Self - education will continue to offer choices, inquiries, and this excellence for Scottish teenagers.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish School of Management
LeBron will be debuting for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James begin his debut for Los Angeles Lakes is almost over.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it's not determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James would probably play just a few minutes.
After the early training this week, James was asked about his plan for the six-time game of Lakers.
"At the stage of my career right now, I don't have to do a pre-summer game to prepare," he said.
Trump General Meeting schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first Trump public meeting of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop in some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stated that the vote was postponed so that he could choose to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump meant to build support for him for the public election due to the government party's risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was held on November.
What time is Trump's general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia scheduled at 7 p.m. and tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump may be discussing this week's trial for the Court of Justice of Great Britain Kavanaugh, which is becoming more tense after the accusation of unsanitary sexual abuse and the expectation that the Senate's vote will be delayed for a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main objective of this public meeting agenda is to help the Republicans to get some moments in the face of public election November.
Therefore, in the campaign President Trump mentioned that five public meetings this week aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republican party tries to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," Reuters said.
"Congress control is very important for its agenda so the president will probably travel as many countries as we can during the busy campaign season," Trump campaign speaker who refuses to mention his name conveys to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's public meeting is expected to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw near the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump was trying to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate for the West Virginia Senate of the Republican Party that was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president must come in an effort to raise his income in the poll," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team bravely holds their hope in the face of single game Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome session is what might be needed in Ryder Cup.
The swinging bandul momentum is a sports concept that is the result of a completely trusted discovery by players, and nothing more than in this competition.
Where do they think the moment is right now?
"Before, they were six points and now four, so I think we considered it a little bit of a moment," Jordan Spieth said as he passed that day.
Of course, Europe has a profit because it exceeds four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth says, felt they had a little bit of a moment and they had a lot of things that could become a spirit, nothing other than Spieth and Justin Thomas that played together all day and each one boasts of three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tea area to the green area and led by skill.
The rumors of a celebration that the parents were getting tougher when they arrived, made an important putting punch to make a series game when he and Thomas lost two against two.
His biting shot won them at the 15th that was greeted by similar shouts, shouting that tell you that he's convinced America doesn't lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes need to be marked.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indefinable story from Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they were also prevented from bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and back nests on Friday mornings.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this crowded crowd that convinces that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and there is no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock up Europe's potential victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It'd be better if at the same time they were placed in different smells.
Still, it is too early to discuss Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut back on Sergio Garcia, a fourball hero in the morning, when he was paired up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on front pine like digging holes that can never be climbed by the Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Though, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change at once.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite far towards the final day, but the foursome sessions also showed that the US team had the guts to compete even though some parties doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day of Ryder Cup after rising from the fourball and foursome games on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The Thomas Bjorn European Team, who wanted to keep the trophies that were untimely acquired in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the morning fourball, made this series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in forsome, won two games, but they could not reduce deficits.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sundays to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational weekend, only became the second pair to win four points from the four openings of their game in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they became very strong to defeat the slimming Woods and America's debut Bryson Dechambeau with stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturdays, once in a brilliant performance but has lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting at fourball morning, then back to pair with Henrik Stenson in forsome and lose 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - rank one and three worlds.
Europe didn't reach it itself even though the day was fun and winding in the west of Paris.
The major winner of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas three times set the Americas back with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 that's interesting for Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two oils.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup where a team returns from the deficit four points entered into the single game, although as a surviving team champion Furyk only needs serial points to maintain the trophy.
But after becoming the second best for two days, the return attack on Sunday seemed to overrun them.
North Korea says 'no way' will disarm separately without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations of the ongoing sanctions against the United States that they were continuing to have confidence in the United States and that it could not have disbanded its nuclear weapons separately in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's annual General Council that North Korea had taken "significant steps that showed good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, demolishing the location of nuclear testing, and promised not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, we didn't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we cannot disarm our own weapons first separately."
While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "stepping" approach to delinquency where North Korea will be punished for taking steps step by step, a meaningful statement stated that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit meeting between the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea that was first held in Singapore on 12 June, at which time Kim promised to strive for "inclusion as a Korean border" while Trump promised security assurances in North Korea.
North Korea had wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53 officially, but the United States said that Pyongyang had to stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call to release international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "advanceization earlier" and increases pressure by giving semi-sanctions to achieve their purpose forcefully, and even rejects "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions will continue to deepen our distrust."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, the US leader of the United Nations Union at the beginning of the week.
The Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the problem-makers in this delinquency are South Korea and not the United States, the collapse of Korea will not reach this kind of dead end."
Even so, Ri's tone of speech dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the United Nations General Court that targeting North Korea's rockets on the United States was something that could not be avoided after the "Lord President Devil" Trump called Kim "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump last year threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, commending Kim for his courage to take steps to dissipate, but that big job still has to be done and the sanctions must continue to be done until North Korea makes a denuculisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--no problem," he said.
Turkey and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Foreign Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctioning of the Security Council must be continued firmly and must not fail until we find out that full, final and verifiable reprisals."
The Security Council has been increasing sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop the development of the Pyongyang nuclear program and ballistic missile.
Pompeo met Ri at the General Council of the United Nations and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there has actually been progress, just North Korea in the count of the hour boiling that he made "a demand like a gangster."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to unload missile sites and also nuclear complexes if the United States took the "appropriate action."
He said that Kim told him to do the "appropriate act" with his desire is the security assurance Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalization of his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough break
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to fight male culture in learning that is growing through caffeine-powered 'manufacturers'.
An academic discovered that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if discussing very basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping-related medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep loss on the study.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I just be told now, at the end of my year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping--that surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The first course launched this year, explained to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic results, and improve their public welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who was very sleepy all week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the influence of caffeine and light, and how athletic results are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleeptime routines.
On the other hand, the participant got an explanation of how long sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then push the attendees to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we're sure that they have the right to know-- like you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,' heal Prof. Czeisler.
The culture is proud of the 'strengthening' still exists, and it is necessary, moreover, that modern technology and increasing pressure on students that means lack of sleep is an ever-growing problem.
Make sure you get enough sleep, with good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, it's enough -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleeplessness causes the brain to turn on hunger mode, creating a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology to help Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his first years at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the whole college.
Next step, he hoped that the entire graduate student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider organizing the alarm during sleep, also the alarm wakes up, and realize the effects of the ‘blue light’ emitted by the electronic screen and the LED light, which can move your circadian rhythm out of its route so as to cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga Put down Gerrard's Army Mentally
Again, Rangers felt the sadness of the day in the middle of Dolly Menga's attack to deliver the Steven Gerrard team on the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibox team has been trying to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 victory in February in St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team has just given Gerrard a second victory in 18 games as a manager, causing his team to miss eight points from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and the players who are out of reason do not seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third position, just left a gaping goal of Winterfell.
And it could be that there would be a further problem in the Rangers Cave after the Calum Spence liner had to be treated because of the head wound after an object was thrown from the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that copied Ayr to the semi-final Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that haunted their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they own better.
They were supposed to have recorded scores in just two minutes when the first short bait Meng was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's glove, but that cage attracted that huge opportunity too wide.
Jacobs' deep-rooted free kicks met Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back.
Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to be penalized when he and Steven Lawless crashed into a quarter of an hour's mark but Steven Thomson refused to join the Colombians.
Rangers only managed to do two throws in the first round, but the previous Iboox guard, Liam Kelly, hardly ever had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head marrow and the easy-to-use attack of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposed to his game path, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Again Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs's deep death ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Meg at the simple end.
Gerrard acted at rest by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that shift almost directly influenced when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of the line to infest.
But Livingston continues to force the team to play the exact game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett wiped out all the long balls.
Holt's team should expand their tops at the end but McGregor stands up well to get Jacobs out before Lithgow sinks wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed penalty again when he argued with Jacobs, but once again Thomson turned his face away.
Almanac: Interviewer Geiger Breaking
And now from our Almanac "Sunday Morning" page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and MASIH will continue to reach... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was a discovery that ultimately made the device called Geiger Breakdown.
Being a science-based tool ever since, Geiger also became a pop cultureist, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starred cowboy scientists who seemed less convincing of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Breakdown, used to find radioactive mineral locations, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atom released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘know’ evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'know' the evil cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune systems to recognize evil cells as part of medication
The method involves the process of extracting the immune cells from the patient, converting them to the lab.
They can then 'know' the common protein in many cancers and then inject it again.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results to patients with various types of cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught her immune system to recognize evil cells, and her ovarian cancer was lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extraction of patients' immune cells, transforming them into laboratories so that they can "know" the proteins that are commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then inject them back into those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The fact is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "supports the growth of some type of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and cholorectals, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as the removal of patients' immune cells and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
The Kanye West begins the Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing the Maga Hat, after its SNL appearance.
Not Running Well
Kanye West was mugged at a studio during Saturday Night Live after playing the mess where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he was going to run in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, named Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he says.
SNL started a show with a password that Matt Damon starred at where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on a sexual violence claim made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not broadcasted, the West tapes were uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock's trying to make fun of the West with that stunt.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind stage because of the hat he wore.
"They're covering me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't come out with that hat.'
They're blocking me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "You want to see a drowning place?" saying that he's going to wear a Superman robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do.
Try to love."
The comment yields at least twice the audience and the SNL show seemed ashamed, Variety reported, with one person saying, "The whole studio is silent."
West was brought in at last moments as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, former rapist boyfriend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses a lot of people with his I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote tweets: "For one of the bravest souls: LOVE HAS BEEN GIVED BACK."
But the carrier of Karen Hunter's show wrote tweets that West was just "being himself and it was really very good."
"But I chose not to provide someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "saints") that I believe in going into and tearing down ideologies that are dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," plus.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he has changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Together with rappers, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and of course under Prince's music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

Star Game of Thrones Harington Kit criticises toxic msculine
Harington's kit is famous for sword swinging in its role as Jon Snow at a mid-century fantasy show full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
However, this actor, 31, with stereotypes of macho heroes, said that the role on that screen often made teenagers feel that they should be strong to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he was convinced of 'something wrong' and questioning how to deal with a bad male problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who just married his opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now-- where is our fault in this masculinity?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, the problem we see now?'
The set trusts television may be responsible for the appearance of a bad mascolinity with its very masculine character.
He went on to say: 'Where is the character from birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, which makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time-- how do we change it?
Because there's clearly something wrong with the young.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in prequeel or sequel to the Game of Thrones when this series would end next summer, saying that he had 'sleighed with the field of war and horses'.
Since November the Kit will re-starve the True West of Sam Shepard, which is the story of his film producer and brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life began' her speech.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love of Kit character, Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
This couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: Tiokh reports 14% of new cases
Thailand has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, says the health officer.
About 40,000 new cases reported in second quarter 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of Thailand as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people who had HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the health officer of Thailand said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Thailand has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Thailand in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was called a major challenge.
Given the conservative value of this country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Government of Thailand has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters argued that the staff had leaked Senator GOP's data, spread 'hazardous lies' and 'complementary theories'
The United States, the Maxine Waters representative on Saturday argued that one of his staff members had sent personal information to three senators of the United States Republic Party to the Wikipedia page of the parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserts that the claim is driven by experts and websites "ultra-right wing".
"Talk, lie, and many more nasty lies," says Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It's reported that the information released includes home address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by unknown people in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel of the Senate on the accusation of improper sexual abuse against the suitor of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This Bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address that identifies the source of the shipment is connected to the Waters office and discloses information from one of the Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"The accusation is not based on this is completely wrong and is a total lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member--who is identity, personal information, and his safety is threatened by false and wrong charges--not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This is a false accusation.
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including former Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"It means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that he's not fit to be a Congressman.
They have learned not to be quick to take offense if a person is falsely accused of something that he has not done.
They must not deviate.
They should not question the cause of the accuser.
They must be quiet and at peace."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's congregation.
Omar Navarro, the candidate for a Republican party that is trying to move Waters into part-time election, also conveys his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's true," he writes on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "right authority and legal entity about this wrong accusation.
"We will make sure that the perpetrator will be revealed," he continues, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Together - poor Rowan Atkinson spy parody
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with an English perspective has become a tradition and it seems to apply to the re-emergence of the parody parody Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcasm of the sarcasm be about how clearly we become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes were touching, and whose faces were not competent, has updated his license to ruin everything for the second time - his name indicates more than anything that he was a large comical creation designed for a non - English-speaking cinema area.
Surely he was a crazy secret agent who, apart from his strange suspicion, had a little clouseau character, followed by Mr. Bean's character and a second-guess who contributed a little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In fact, he is based on an international mysterious visitor and man who Atkinson played on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving behind the mess.
There's one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English approached the helicopter by wearing mid-century zippers and spinning rotors quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedics was shown, but his humor felt less energetic and too strange, especially when branded "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible had trusted to insert comedics as a substance.
It feels like it's meant for kids from adults, and for me it's some weird Johnny English bullshit that's not innovative and it's focused on Atkinson's movie jokes in Bean's personality.
The prize that's been warming up these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, unveiling the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint a busy agent -- unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has completely destroyed his people politically: Emma Thompson played very well with the quasi-Teresa-May characters but not much can be obtained from his script.
His intelligent advisor gives information that because every active spy has been weakened, he has to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, now employed as head of the school in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to do undercover surgery: there are some good jokes here, when English offers spy schools like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and reunited with an old friend who had suffered a long time, Bough, backed by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, the high-class role where Vicki Pepperdine got a little out of her way.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent, returned to action, met a beautiful mysterious woman, Ophelia Bulletinova, who was supported by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister worrys about falling into the influence of the billionaire of charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve the English computer problem: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventure: disguised as a waiter, they burned down a fast French Saxon restaurant; they made chaos by smuggled themselves onto a luxury ship owned by Volta; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use a virtual reality headset to get used to the inside of the Volta house.
All the stops must have been pulled for the last sequence, but with the hospitality and the noise like that, there's a little TV channel of kids that's all about everything.
That's pretty moderate.
And like the other Johnny English film, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
Workers argue are planning a plan for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Union considered radical plans that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The union was reported to want the owners of the company to continue the recovery through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional holidays.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend of three days - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'no' with the economic agenda of the party and the plan encourages the country to support the workers.
The four - day shift of the week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
One source, the senior of the Labour Union said to The Sunday Times: 'The loan of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen overnight, but four days a week is an aspiration that matches the party's approach in order to re-balance the economy that supports the workers and the party's industry strategies as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, because the Green Party has already promised four days of work in a week on the 2017 public election campaign.
However, at this moment that aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party's spokesman says: 'The workday of the week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a social revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the anonymous director and the slugs at the utility company.
This shadow Chancellor's plan also means, the current stockholder in the water company might not get the whole stock back because the government of the Labour Party can do the "adjustment" for the reason of the perceived infringement.
He also made sure that his plan was to put the employees in the board and create the Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to the employees, which would bridge the annual dividend to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his remand at least for a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of this office could affect the senators of the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was held on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senate of the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, that charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's the one who's firm, determined, firm."
But it seems that Graham's voice will not be changed.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I know is: Brett strongly objected to it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned was unable to verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival and has this event done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that showcases the star’s most impressive and effective mission; ending the world’s poverty.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be a witness to tens of thousands of people who have come to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the purpose of this event which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (except you want to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending email to world leaders, calling, or other ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert the right way to get people to do an action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set another goal.
It is said that this action has helped trigger world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will influence more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of them have been disbursed or funded.
This group estimates that the security funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some major commitments, among others, are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in England made up of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," which promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the food shortage in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, developers, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about this lack of nutrition as a milestone in history," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were done to increase nutrition for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions at the General Question on their websites that asked, "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen answers, "This is going to be a long and difficult road--sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheids that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that perform at this year's New York show, which Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will guide.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "block" to curb Russia's energy export - Secretary in the Country
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy for help to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believed that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation - was a substitute for exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be the energy maker, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lane is open, and, if necessary, to do the blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the concert participants held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits who called themselves "the voice of energy customers" in the U.S.
He compared the approach Washington made in a deal with Russia and Iran, to see that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economy choices in Iran and Russia are much more, using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with the economy that relies on fossil fuels.
This statement emerged when Trump's government rep is on a mission to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, were trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 oil mill project, which Trump said made Berlin a "prisoner" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-dollar oil mill project, designed to double the capacity of the oil mill pipe that is up to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's hard fight against this project was merely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy can't be put on pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. attitude has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has reconfirmed their commitment to this project.
The German leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the energy policy of the European Union and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I'll face a big problem if the third country mixes our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "see the situation" when she ran for president in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "see the situation" when running as president after a part-time election.
While campaigning in the city hall in Hollyoke, Massachusetts, Warren emphasized that he would consider self-administering.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in the top position," as he told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll reflect the situation when I run as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he campaigned in the city hall, saying that he "takes this region in the wrong direction."
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's blanks in delivering his criticism of Trump and the so-called Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren's own constitution did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "possibly" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run himself, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent of them support the call.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run himself, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of self - remand and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of launching themselves in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin on the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son experiences, what he will experience when he returns, I can connect with other families who also experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers have experienced," he said in front of those who attended the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "an elephant in the room" and told him about his son and other veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, their fellow soldiers and the flightmen and every other member of the army to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and the possession of weapons intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of a new policy of asylum
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal challenge against new U.S. policies that refuse asylum for victims who flee gangs or domestic violence.
The representative of the 18 states and the district proposed friends-of-the-court briefing on Friday in Washington to support the sugar seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v. In the trial filed by American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has yet to be revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a cruel gang member," had wronged him, but the U.S. officials refused his request on July 20.
He's under arrest in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced a large number of South American commercialists, as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy is behind the 2014 immigration council decision allowing dark immigrants to flee from domestic violence to propose asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "improves the laws of the state, federal, and international that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibitions violate the principle," said friend-of-the short brief.
Further prosecutors gave a brief opinion that the policy that refused entry to immigrants was detrimental to the US economy, saying that they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to stop giving asylum to victims who escaped from domestic violence and gang violence.
"There are those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," Sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11.
Something is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in the Palu because the victims doubled during the race in time to find the survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very exciting," said Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, soothing her baby boy standing in the refugee center in destroyed Palu town.
"Every minute ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
The people were seen back to their destroyed house, taking the water-stained stuff, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and cared for in the hospital, the damage caused by the 7.5 - powerful earthquake, is very messy.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, lying outside the Pallu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a strong tremor.
Her tears flow as she recalls her feelings when an earthquake shook the hotel room on the five - floor floor where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"There's no chance of saving yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I did not know what to do with my daughter and my daughter.
May they survive."
U.S. Ambassador accuses Turkey of 'strengthening' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after the official newspaper of Tinokh contains four-page ads on an U.S. daily calling the profit of the U.S.-Tikh trade, US ambassador to Tinokh accuses Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday who then referred to the Chinese Daily payment supplement in Des Moines Register - the state’s most common newspaper in Iowa - after accusing Thailand of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election of Congress on November 6, an accusation disputed by Tiokh.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. official told Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of the Washington campaign to push the pressure of Tiokh.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are stuck in the ever-increasing trade war, which makes them raise the level of import tariffs for each other.
The rate of payback in the early years of this trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported the Trump Republic Party, says experts in Turkey and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to Taiwan and former former governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural goods to Taiwan, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tiokkok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by running propaganda ads on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the government of Thailand exploits the tradition of free speech and press freedom that is highly prized in America by carrying paid ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In fact, in the street newspaper kiosks here, in Beijing, you will find a limitation against different voices and will not see a real mirror of the possible different opinions of the Chinese about the troubled Chinese economic crossing, considering the media is under the control of the Communist Party of Turkey," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Thailand rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warned, Republican Party Distanceed Women's Choices From Half Elections With Kavanaugh Disasters
Because of the fact that the important people in the Republican Party who stood up and defended the candidates for the Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh in the face of some sexual violence charges, analysts have warned that they would see the attack back, especially from women, at the general election half the time is coming.
Emotions to this problem are very high, and most members of the registered Republican Party have shown that they want to move forward on the vote.
It can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's encouragement in the final minute to do FBI investigation will be enough to relieve the voter's anger.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted, "November is close!" when they did a demonstration at the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to move forward in Kavanaugh's pursuit of testimony Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," political analysts not Stu Rothenberg's party, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voice-gatherers in the younger suburbs and voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before the public testimony of Ford that described in detail sexual harassment against him by the suitor of the Supreme Court, analysts advised that there would be a future attack to follow if the Republican Party continued to motivate him to move forward with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic Party, early last week, to the NBC News.
"It's not just about the selection of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on a backup bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, US Priority Director, a group that helps to select the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided on who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more different choice than the last one.
A new opinion base made by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe or possibly believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After the encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian report.
Ford's testimony under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the next Supreme Court leader showed him his balls when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Discovery Planning to Start New Internet to Meet Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web researcher, launched a startup that was trying to hit Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the legend of this technology, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, joking Berners-Lee says that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage may include a contact list, a list of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In the company known as "personal power through data."
The idea of establishing Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company will provide resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Now this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers contracted to work on the project, and the voluntary code-making community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization applications using tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a total change where all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has become a voice that has been influential in the neutrality of network debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Announcing WW1 Victoria Cross
The only church in England that won Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, was remembered on the ground of birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A warning stone was authorized by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "smart symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of grandpa's achievement winning awards.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the canal de Saint-Quentin "passing through a very thick fog beneath a fire from the field weapons and engines."
Then he rushed forward to the combat line and with the "greater courage" leading the front line before rushing through the field weapons alone and crippling three detaliations.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put down the flower charter after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very flattered to play a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many people will give."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been working all night to watch Bellator 206 that's soaked up just to refuse to watch the main show.
San Jose's bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and being displayed live all night in England on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the English audience was struck when their ride turned into Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciative after having worked until the next special day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter describes the shift to children's cartoons as "disgusting jokes."
"This is the rule of government, that at 6 o'clock the content is not suitable for display, so replaced with the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president marketing and Bellator communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa and pigs," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said that they would make up their schedule by counting British audiences in the near future.
"According to me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But right now there at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, on Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, a lot of reverse text and everything is not educated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce only five fights of six -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid overdrinking for fans, and we're doing it.
It's a non-profit."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lower' linked to sexuality issues
Olympiade divers Tom Daley said he grew up with low self because of his sexuality -- but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he went into middle school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being an old man made him care less to win the Olympics.
The bringer of the usual show that has been going on for a long time, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off from getting sick.
Looking like the people who were cut off on Laverne's first program, Daley says he felt "less than everybody else who grew up with him because "not something socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said, "Until today, that feeling is less than any other, and it has become clear to me that it has given me power and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two Olympic bronze medals have become a leading LGBT campaigner and have used his performance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said, he spoke because he felt lucky he could live with openness without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
This three-time world champion said he was in love with a guy -- film maker from the US Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley was married to Oscar's 20-year-old watercolor this year, and he said that being single is no problem.
"When you experience so many problems at a very young age," he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had the same tide.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, all around 'I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they'd already get tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit in the front row of my father'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't defeated," he said.
The next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I know only, this is what I dreamt of all my life--to dive in front of the crowd at the Olympics, no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - that had joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still made him laugh.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when offered to Ryder Cup on Saturday
Pegolf America Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change the role of avoiding an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year show to record the 12th time, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and the four-ball group on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually does for the United States, this top winner five times divides the time between being a cheerleader and playing his game at the range, hoping he can fix what's bothering him.
Never been the rightest golfer even when he was at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man didn't fit to take a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gave long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the 9th game on Sunday, to face the very accurate British champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new comedian Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Mickelson game will prove very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understands his role today, claps my back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for tomorrow's game," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine he's playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's how they play, and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that would never match his individual record height.
Mickelson plotted 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven serials, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, gypsy, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He gave many things, more than just playing."
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows the grand superiority could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone who leads large enough to his last single game in Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, with the captain of the Seve Ballesteros team holding the top five points over America, but just touched the finish line with their noses with the faintest margin, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're getting the big top in Valderrama; we're getting the big top in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now," says Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you're going into a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the writing board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's what it's focused on.
I've been saying, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we also realize what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
It's good to see the players playing in the golf course, Bjorn added: "In this I will never advance myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to give to all players, get the best out of yourself for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a japan, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of the last day's big game, being part of the team that won in Brookline before it ended with defeat when Europe did "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment runs one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight against Rory McIllroy at the top, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the top order.
"I went with a group of these guys in order like this because I thought I could close all the way," Bjorn said about his single choice.
The German new warship was resustained
The latest German Navy patrol ship was supposed to have started in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but that ship would not be there at least until the next year because its system was wrong and its cost increased, the local media reported.
The task of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted the military speaker.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the issue of post-shipment has disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that were commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come as replacement for the old Bremen-class patrol ship.
This ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-capal missiles, and some demon technologies, such as radar erasers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of care - should be allowed to use the latest bodyguards for two years away from the harbor.
But the continued delay means this sophisticated warship - which is said to have allowed Germany to highlight its power abroad - will be worn out at the beginning of its period of duty, the Die Zeit notes.
The bad-flying F125 ship has been a public announcement last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss fleet in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the craft after shipping.
Only a few known reasons behind the ship's return, but the German media quote a number of "software and hardware" features that make the warship useless if used for a battle mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by ship crews of 120 sailors - only half of the labor force on the older Bremen-class warships.
Also, the fact that the ship’s boat is too much would reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Navy to add to the news in the near future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is believed to be twice as heavy as the ship with similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to broken hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including training by ship crew - is also a problem.
It's said to rise surprisingly up to $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of $2.2 billion.
The problem that is plaguing this latest ship of guards is of great importance in the light of the latest warning given that there is a fall in the power of the German Navy.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "out of the ship with the ability to spread."
The civil servant said that as the problem grew, because the old ships were no longer used but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats secretly
New research was carried out on a farm in the Scottish High Plain, which aims to reveal how bats use natural beams in their food hunt.
Expected this finding will give new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help guide conservation activities in the near future.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow a common bat and soprano and a long - eared brown bat and Daubenton in Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed at the main location around the properties to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveillance using gengam detectors.
The sound experts who analyze all the recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and the species that do what activities.
Then maps and habitat reports will be designed to create images of the scale of nature detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor for the NTS, hoping this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as grassland production and how best to preserve the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England has fallen sharp in the last few centuries.
These bats are threatened with construction and development work that affects the nest and the habitat is missing.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to trap bats and chemical treatment of buildings, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated gem location techniques to find insects properly and obstacles on their flight routes.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, cares deeply about bats.
Have ten trained experts, who routinely carry out surveys, nest checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only natural citadel in Scotland at the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager said farming was a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of bat testing before maintaining the properties, because without realizing there is a possibility that the destruction of a newborn nest could kill up to 400 female and small bats, which might destroy the entire local population.
Witches were protected, killed, harassed, or robbed of their nests were illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Conservation Officer of Kelelawar Trust, has encouraged the public to join in.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species that we don't know how their population is."
Ronaldo, who refuses to accept a rape claim, is preparing an attorney to sue for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape claim on him as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer would sue for German news magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charge.
The attackers Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then supposed to have paid him by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in the video Live Instagram to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo, threatened the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," winner Ballon d'Or five times this tells the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's a normal thing.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call "a suspicion report in the field of privacy that can't be accepted," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said he would ask compensation for "replacement of moral loss in the amount that fits the burden of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious personal infringements in the past few years."
The alleged incident was said to occur in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player’s room, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report filed at Clark’s District Court in Nevada.
Majorga said that Ronaldo kneeled after the incident he was accused of and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" that disappointed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirms that they both had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had taken a vision of his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to resolve the problem outside the court because he felt "he was afraid to get revenge" and worried "would be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's been constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: British "will regret forever" the loss of car makers
English "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England had told the BBC that if England left the European Union without a deal, for a while it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said the impact of border suspensions if there was no agreement, it would hurt Brexit in terms of the cost of work.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"My opinion is that if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Another British car producer has expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without a deal on how the border trade would go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said he would close the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the car makers said was the risk of supply chains if there was no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production lines are run on the "timely" production principle, with a range that enters every 37 minutes good from British and European suppliers for cars made according to orders.
If the British left the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be an interference on the border, which, according to industry, could cause delays and fewer parts of the body.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supplies at her factory in Derbyshire, said the company's representative, and thus production would be stopped.
Clark says Chequers Theresa May's plan to connect with the future European Union is "calibrated properly to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told today's BBC Radio 4 program.
"The evidence is not only of Toyota but also of the other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what has already been the chain of supply that has been running very well."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the cost increases will reduce the power of the factory and will ultimately damage the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union manager in the factory, said his crew has become more concerned: "According to my experience, once this job is gone, he will never come back.
The government speaker said, "We've put forward an appropriate and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the near future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, leaving the White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with the senior vice attorney Rod Rosenstein can "come back in another week" because of the upcoming war against the Great Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh still continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsellor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s involvement in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia’s assistants, and the potential to prevent justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the grand prosecutor's representative or not, who will endanger Mueller's freedom, has been triggering a rumor in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and possibly include the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein disputed the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to resign.
On the other hand, meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations office in New York, announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose for no" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was rescheduled to avoid a conflict with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom would give testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, which was subsequently postponed the full Senate vote.
Secretary of the Trump press, Sarah Sanders, played on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting was not set, it might be this week, I can see that putting it off next week is also good considering the other things that happened in the high court.
But let's just look at it and I always want to share the latest news with the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The bringer of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders says that the meeting is rarely because it's not because of the feelings that TV reporters "are trying to draw attention," though, he says, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be improved.
"The president did more questions directly than the previous president," he said without mentioning any evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in an open session or press conference with visiting high officials.
The solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president may show his reasons, do a free and sometimes strange appearance before the reporters gather.
Health secretary wrote a letter to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit's problem
The health secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will still work here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England attracted itself from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed itself to meeting the regular status fees for European citizens working in the transferred public service.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiation between England and the European Union on this withdrawal continues, approaching the decision expected in the fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for possible scenarios with no agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That's why I want to reassert how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Conducted Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
The backlash of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after a head injury on 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Head coach Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured reporter that was happening shortly before the round was over.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell fainted there," said Reed.
Coach and medical power gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it in the air and bringing it to further assessment.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no detail on the type/level of injury suffered" and the Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a two-tiered student of this red shirt, was in his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five tekels on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made the total tekels during this season become 18 tekels.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher cost materials when buying properties in England
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher cost of materials when they buy properties in England, along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless according to a new Tory plan
This step will hold back Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The cost of this material will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance estimates it will collect up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have higher bea material when they buy properties in England - along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts in attracting young voters with promise to provide a more accessible housing and to target high income.
The cost of materials will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that stimulates the government’s efforts to combat bums.
Additional costs - which is an additional cost to current material costs, including the higher level that was introduced two years ago on the purchase of a second house and the purchase of a house for rent - can reach three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It's estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties were purchased by non-English people, which are causing price increases and making it harder for the first buyer to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital city -- have become a "ghost city" because many foreign buyers spend most of the time abroad.
This new policy came out only a week after Boris Johnson called for cutting the cost of materials to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the price of property remains high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore the quota for the houses within her in order to repair the "dangerous housing" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals for reform in attractive housing, including rent supervision and ending "free of guilt".
He also wanted to give the board greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last time I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restoring the dream of England--that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our homeless housing market.
English will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for people who do not live in Britain, as well as a foreign - based company, to buy easy homes for hard workers in Britain.
To many people the dream of having a house is a far-off thing, and the act of disgrace is not lawful."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambiance is leading the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to be a Scottish manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, is divided into three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Premier League of Scotland last season.
"I want to redeem my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something interesting to me to return.
But that chance will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former boss Alloa Athletic said he wasn't afraid to follow the tracks of the big names in that club, after he had previously refused the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because the structure and facilities in this club, there's no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't make it easy to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there."
Karier Ross in team management only three years, after some time as an assistant boss in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation abyss into the winner of the winner of the championship next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he's ever done during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the intersection of the road I have to go through," he recalls when taking over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, looking for a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some of the right things.
But playing can be hard.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still experiencing it in terms of working pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I've done it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life."

Survey found, the right time to drink beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
Summer waves have increased public income in Britain struggling to survive, but more pressure is put on the restaurant network.
Numbers show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July - but income in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant, who compiled those numbers, said: "The sun that shines brightly and participates in the British World Cup longer than expected means, the month of July will follow the same pattern as the month of June before, where the public revenue increases by 2.8 percent, except for a restaurant that gets a hard crash.
The drop in the restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
The pubs and bars that sell drinks so far are most powerful compared to what happened at a down restaurant.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, though not separate restaurant operators.
Looks like people just come out for a drink.
Selling all over the pubs and trendy bars that sell drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, a review of recreation and RSM hotels, said: "This is continuing the train we have seen since April.
The weather and the impact of big social events or sports remains the biggest factor in market sales outside the home.
It is no wonder that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, even though the decline in sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the cost pressures that are taking place.
Long summer should not come when the operators who sell food are having bad times, and time will tell us if the temperature we've enjoyed in August will give you a little rest."
Total growth in sales throughout the pub and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the roadblock on the brand launch.

One of five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Survey reveals, one of five children -- some of them are still 11 -- have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 middle school students reveals the development of the page "False Insta"
This news has increased the concern that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "especially" account to show parents
One of the five children - some of them are still 11 - made social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of the "False Insta" account - a reference for a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they operated on the "main" account that had been cleaned up to be shown to the parents, while they also had a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found a teenager who asked someone else to "rape me."
The study carried out by British Digital Awareness and the Man's School Principal Conference" and the Head of the Women's School (HMC) from independent schools found 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
Chief HMC, Mike Buchanan said, "This is disturbing so many teenagers who try to create an online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" in the Scottish athletic council.
Eilidh Doyle has been selected to join the Scottish athletic council as non-executive director at the annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is a skirmishing athlete and Scotland's most widely-marked field of honor and Chief Ian Beattie describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the field of sports to benefit from various experiences at the international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
America's athletic athlete, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the total of four Olympic gold medals and now becomes this BBC expert, can't walk now after a moment's ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today was a month ago I suffered from a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine if I can recover and to what level of recovery.
It's a very exhausting job to recover completely, learn how to walk back, and today perform practice!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump advertising that compares mother to cow has split opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has divided opinions in the online world with an advertisement that compares the mother who is breastfed with the cattle being slaughtered.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "the breast pump that can be used with the first silent in the world," Elvie consumer technology company released an advertisement inspired by video music genius to show the freedom this new pump gave to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the barn with cow straws following a song that includes lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm bluffing myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice this isn't ambiguing, this is my boob."
They went on to say: "Pumpa out, pump out, pump out, I feed them baby, pump out, pump out, pump out, I milk my lady."
However, ads published on this company’s Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a wide range of reactions from viewers, with many saying this makes "worship" in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows also have to be pregnant and pregnant to produce milk, unless their baby is stolen from them in a few days after birth," he wrote.

Other comments: "A trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise a breast pump to the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
The others added: "An ad lost in meaning."
Others defend the advertisement, with a woman confessing that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breast-feeding.
The pressure makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's kind of crazy, but I accept it.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
The others said: "This is a pleasant advertisement for mothers who are blackmailed and feel like cows."
This is not an ad praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt danced with the hidden pump that was stuck in their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insight of many women who are blackmailing ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is really hening, with no cables or tubes and steps in the bra feeding, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out blackmailing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in Mother's office, commented: "Elvie pump is a product of the reporter that is worth launching with convincing and provocative.
By comparing the image between expressing the woman and the bull we want to pump the ASI and all its challenges, and showing it by way of comfort and pleasure with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump has become the main news.

Hundreds of Migran's Children Moving Silently to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children being held up is increasing even though the crossing of the monthly border is still unchanged, part of the result of a hard statement and policy introduced by Trump's government that makes childcare difficult with sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by moving forward to save children.
The risk increases in June, when the federal government announces that future sponsors and other adult members of their households have to hand over fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the field of immigration and Bea Cukai, testified to Congress that the agency had captured dozens of people who applied to support children under an advanced age.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested had no record of criminal records.
"About 80 percent of the sponsors or sponsors are illegal in this country, and most of them are bad foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children faster, officials introduce new rules that require some of them to attend court within one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which had been the standard before, the rest of the workers in the shelter.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status case to immigration judges.
Those whom they consider not worthy of help will be deported directly.
The longer the children were arrested, the more likely they were becoming more anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape efforts, the workers in the shelter and the system reports received in the past few months.
The lawyers say that the concern is increasing at a larger facility like Tornillo, which has signs of a child struggling to tend to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the camp city without giving them enough time to prepare for them emotionally or saying good-bye to his friends can make the trauma that has been fought for.
Syria is asking the US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately.
Speaking in the UN General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war had now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister's representative, said foreign troops occupied Syria illegally, with reason to fight terrorism, and "will be handled with all intents and purposes."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without any conditions," he told the council.
Moualem points out that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He confirmed that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we clean up all Syrian territory" from the terror group and "the presence of an illegal foreign army."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, particularly training and influencing Kurdi and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
The French had over 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem confirmed that they should return immediately, and he blamed "a number of Western countries" for "declaring an extraordinary fear" which spurs refugees to move away.
"We've asked international society and humanity to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a complete human problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war was agreed.
The UN diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel fortress has given rise to an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevents large-scale attacks by Russian-supported Syrian troops in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem asserts that the agreement has "clear timing" and gives rise to hope that military action will target the Mujahids among the fighters of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be swallowed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee made up of the government and opposition members to make the post-war invitations for Syria and open the way to the general election.
Moualem placed the following conditions in the Syrian government's committee, insisting that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the latest bill-in-laws," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 unless, because many liberals hope, prosecution and scandals will soon end his presidency.
No one doubts, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there's no sign of weariness for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's main hour rate has risen more than twice as high as 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly three times as high as 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main watchers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has held the peak of cable TV with 3.5 million main news viewers on night.
"This is the spirit that makes people interested because it's something that they don't understand," said Neal Baer, the actor of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," about the secretary of the cabinet who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comic writer and author "Just the Funny Parties: and some hard truths in sneaking into Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembered riding a cab in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice rights.
Why?
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
Note the value of entertainment in a distorted sense.
Of course, unlike any other TV event, the story coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
Instead, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Even so, not just being a well-known citizen at six o'clock you found yourself watching the panel experts discuss the use of the "background" source Bob Woodward for his book called "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's leather bomber jacket worth $15,000 ("best dress with pride," The Washington Post) and the implication of Stormy Daniels' terrible description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"By the policy he does, he makes it as if it were a reality event that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performance and the course of Trump's daily story (choosing enemies with NFL, commending Kim Jong-un).

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it felt bright 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he hid while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and the next Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we held all the crazy shows on that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

There's a lot of money from outside flooding the best part-time election competition in the White House.
It is only reasonable that Pennsylvania 17 received a cash flood, thanks to the restoration of the congress district that provided two farms in the same chairing process.
The recently re-established Pittsburg District, introduced Conor Lamb from Rep. Democracy - which won seats in another district through the special election last spring.
Lamb moved forward against other years, the Keith Rothfus Republic, now representing the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which is on the brink of the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were not constitutionally on the side of the Republican party.
The competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in a large campaign between the financial side of the big party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRRC).
Lamb became more well known in Pennsylvania after thin victory in the special election of March that was public watch for Congress District 18 Pennsylvania.
The seat has been occupied by the officials of the Republic Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts send a little higher democracy party.
The U.S. is counting on the punishment of El Salvador for supporting Turkey, and then retreating.
The diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had admitted Beijing, giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
Foreign Department officials decided to pull back the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest ruling no longer acknowledging Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department speaker, appeared in an early statement this month.
But the punishment was considered only for El Salvador, who had received help from some $140 million in the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support and economics.
The proposed punishment, which includes the spread of targeted financial assistance and visas, will harm the Middle American country and increase its level of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meeting took place, the North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to be continued, so that it would be effective to end the trial for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal made by the government at the meeting, to the diplomats.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reproof or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House speaker for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that three U.S. officials had, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss internal considerations about this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also talked about this unclear situation.
Study Story
Another surprising story is a special report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's legal impedance, which now has very important evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigation of whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our public election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the electors, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
That's why there's still much to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's government cannot be avoided--or his equal in Europe.
There's a choice we'd better make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we've been fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to do a coup against Hitler, if only the West against him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the next massacre.
The beginning of history revolved around such an intersection point, and the fast - paced or delayed democracy scene cannot be avoided.
Now Americans face a number of points of this change.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the one who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this report reported that, last year, he recommended that the president be quietly filmed and that he think that he doesn't deserve to serve as president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is not true.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation recently asked Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or fair--or if he was brought to the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress who will ask for Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once lived in my great embassy.
She survived, and then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a candle on the table that wrote swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans felt optimistic about the game facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers invited Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning over Austria, following good results in Spain against Villarreal early this month, will strengthen their position to escape from the European G League Group.
The knee injury made Graham Dorrans' midgets can't show up this first season until the 2-2 mark against Villarreal, but he's sure that Rangers can use the result as a pajama for greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," the 31-year-old speaker.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go with a swinging point.
In the end, we may be able to do that, but we believe, the results may be fair.
In the first round, they might look better but in the second round, we got up and became a better team.
Starting on Thursday, tonight is another great European day.
We hope to bridge three points even though it's going to be a tough match because they have good results in their last game, but, with the support of the support behind us, I'm sure we can keep going forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because what happened to my injury and the change in the club itself but now there's a really good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good practice.
May we now develop, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although the surveyors had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people had discussions with family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their mates.
Only 10 percent of them said to discuss this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start that discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
It's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don't tell them what you want first.
Speak with your family counsellor, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Deal with your financial advisors: Your advisors can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay those expenses.
The funding you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these expenses or assure yourself of your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal document: Face an intrusive legal debate.
Show immediate authority for your health care, which is someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your desire is met by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the letter of authority in respect of your finances should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of all your financial decisions must choose, other than to make sure your payment is paid if-if you are not able.
Always remember with every detail as small as any: Imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency condition and on their way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer questions about medicine or allergies?

A man shot a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a party at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon area, when several times shots were fired on his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by an officer about 2:30 p.m. BST, and it was said as "random."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The wounds suffered by the victims did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses had been filed by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis struck Indonesia.
Earthquakes and tsunamis so devastatingly hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, last Friday, had eliminated at least 384 souls, the guards ’ effusions, and the estimated number of deaths would increase.
The disbandment of communication has resulted in the assistance of officials who are struggling to obtain information from Dogalga Regency, a region to the north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake center that hits with the power 7.5 Richter scale.
In the Pallu, after a disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of main facts about the city of Pallu and Dojaga, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu was the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow shores of the western shore of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When an earthquake and tsunami hit, this city is celebrating its 40th birthday.
Dojuka, in the meantime, is an entire county of over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative area below the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The actual economy in the South Sulawese province is looking for fish and cropping, especially on the coast of Dojoga.
However, the presence of nickel - mining was also important in this province, even though most of it was located on Morrowali, on the shores of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the past 100 years, the Pallu and Dojaga have several times been hit by a tsunami, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Committee.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Dojoga were left standing.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in West Dojoga.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, and because of this, earthquakes will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of large earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in the past few years are as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, right on the west coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, until it destroyed 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half the dead were in Aceh.
In 2005: At the end of March and early April, a number of other powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
In 2006: A 6.8 - powerful earthquake hit southern Java, the densest island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami on the south coast and causing nearly 700 deaths worldwide.
The year 2009: An earthquake with strength of 7.6 occurred near the city of
Victims died of more than 1,100 people.
2010: One of the islands of Mentawai, off the Sumatran coast, also hit an earthquake of 7.5 feet [10 m] above sea level, triggering a devastating tsunami that struck some 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's Regiment, Aceh, also suffered a superficial earthquake and resulted in destruction, as well as the panic of people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami that killed last year.
Although there is no tsunami potential this time, more than 100 people died because of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, also known as the tourist island, also has a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, where most of the northern side of the island.
The earthquake spreads thousands of buildings and, at the same time, hosts thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's First Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor of Alaska and vice president's candidate, has been arrested instead of an attack.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, prevented domestic violence reports and against arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspicion of a crime, he seized the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Matt-Su Pre-Trial Prison, with $500 fines unsecured, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, sure" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three Class A minor offenses, which could have him sentenced for a year and a fine of $250,000.
Besides, he was also charged with charges of class B, with one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report on the alleged attack.
The case is now brought to the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of firearms in a drunken state, also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of pointing out his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin suffered a breakdown from a veteran group of veterans linking his son’s violence with PTSD as a result of his duties throughout Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
A 7.5 - scale earthquake that could trigger tsunamis has left thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communications networks have been broken up, and deaths are estimated to continue to increase over the next few days.
Earthquake struck the middle of Sulawesi, which lies in the east of the Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The videos show how widespread the disaster is through the social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to mark a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke down the coast.
The federal prosecutor is working on a death penalty that rarely occurs for a terrorist attack suspect in NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York is serving the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people died -- the punishment is rare and has never been carried out in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was suspected of carrying out an attack by crashing his rented truck from Home Depot on foot and bicycle driver along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to permit the death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "on purpose" killed those eight victims and "on purpose" caused serious injury to the body, on the basis of a declaration of intent to punish the death penalty, which was filed with the South New York District.
According to court documents, the two defendants are allowed to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jurist board set up Saipov with 22 defendants, including eight charges of murder in the field of blackmail, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as violent charges and motor vehicle damage efforts.
According to prosecutors, the attack requires "substantial planning and early maturation," as an image of Saipov's crime done with "detestable, cruel, and rude."
It was revealed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims at the incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counting a decade since the South New York District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of killing two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution of the death penalty at the federal court in New York in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty in the spy conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric seat on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show the regret of the day and month after the attack.
When asked by the investigators, he said that he was happy with what he had done, to the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the video ISIS on his phone, as contained in the charges.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, to be ordered by the police.
He said he was innocent of the 22 charges he had been charged with.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" against the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death rather than to accept an application for life imprisonment without bail would only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," said Uncle Patton.

Nigel Farage is calling for the people's rockets today in protest action at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians had to 'feel hot' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested to join in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporter, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that England 'should be out' right now if Farage is serving as Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faced in the reconciliation of his shared position has been met by the supporters of Remain Tories who joined in the separate protest action threatened Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to defend his Chequers engagement plan to remain on his track even in the middle of the Brexitiers, Remainers and European Union attack.
Allied countries stressed that he would be driven forward to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he had a bad return reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between their bidding and 'cold' packages.
Bone told the mass Leave Media Leave in Solihull that he wanted to' get rid of Chequers.
He said that Farage had to appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiating with Brussels.
"If he's still in charge, we'll be out now," he says.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He said: "We have not fought in the world war to submit.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone ignores the suggestion that the public opinion that might lead to a change since the vote in 2016: "The idea that British thinking has changed and wants the conditions fixed, it's totally wrong."
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, appeared to reporters: 'Simply, I'd like to say: "O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular in the public, while Opposition will not choose it, because it is not popular with our parties and our activists who really come down the road and make us chosen in the first position.
Our pleas, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
And he said, "The Prime Minister will defend their work when their promise is fulfilled."
Farage says that the demonstration of politics must be thwarted in order to be 'cooled' if they want to reject the 2016 referendum decision.
‘This is the most precious moment of trust between our citizens and our political parties,’ he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we will not escape you from doing that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic community: 'I want you to make our political group, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
“We are moving the goal of this country’s citizens who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until Britain’s independent, self - rule and pride come true. ”
Meanwhile, the Remainers were moving through Birmingham before launching action in the city center for two hours.
The activist line seems to spread the banners Tories Against Brexit after starting the line at the end of this week.
Companions in the Labour Line, Lord Adonis, mocking the Conservative group related to the security issue of their party application when the conference was opened.
‘These people are telling us that they can master the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-burdening border, in a range of unrestricted free trade in Ireland,’ he healed.
‘It was really a show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' cure it.
Warren's planning on doing a "serious crash" on the president's stalking site
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to hit the president's hostage after the election in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democracy Party declared its future at the city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often threatened President Donald Trump, called for the re-election in November against the state's GOP representative, Geoff Diehl, the vice-president of the campaign Trump in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked against Trump by 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke is the 36th with the voters, which has been called the city hall since Trump's shift.
An interviewer asks him if there's a plan to run as president.
Warren replied, "This is the right time for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our corrupt government, and it includes the time for women to sit on top."
He's caught shooting Sims, the LSU player.
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that he was arrested by a shooting suspect until he died Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. in the ET press conference.
They released video shootings on Friday, where an identified man asks for help as seen in the footage.

Ajang Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifier on Saturday that would bring Mercedes team orders to play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton because he held his position in the first round and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel became the first one to drive into the pit and let Hamilton move in the thickness at the end of the crowd, something that should be very determined.
Mercedes went into the pit one lap after that and left after Vettel, but Hamilton kept going after some follow-up action that showed the resistance of Ferrari drivers left the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the back of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in most races because he held off the change of tires to target quick resolution and take over the Kimi Raikkonen position for fourth position.
He finally got into the pit on the 44th lap but couldn't improve his move on the eight laps left because Raikkonen finally took fourth position.
That's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who lets me.
Team has done an amazing job of having two," Hamilton said.
It's Body Language That's Bad
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein in a relic on Saturday through his motto, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence against the future High Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking of a relic in West Virginia, the president did not directly convey a statement made by Ford before the Senate's Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what is happening in the senate that shows people who are "wrong and mean and dishonest."
"Something can happen and something beautiful that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you see the outings and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, hold on a second.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak it," plus, as a senator impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July last, and it had leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein had submitted the leaks didn't come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee, told Hill.
"He asked me to keep him secret and I kept him as secret as he asked."
But his rejection was rejected by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the next High Judge, who was accused of sexual assault on three women, the president was impressed by the claim that democracy used charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, pregnancy, they don't care who they hurt, what they have to walk for power and surveillance," Mediaite report on the president's speech.

Drivers and Airways Die to Confirm Hundreds of Passengers in a Survived Air Force From the Earth
An air traffic driver in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The earthquake continued to shake the region and many were trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But as his fellows fled for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunahan the Great refused to leave his post in a rocking driver's tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure the 6321 waterboat flight that was at that time on the runway, can safely take off.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower when he felt the tower began to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Speakers of the Indonesian Navigation Service Agency, Yohannes Sirrait, delivered his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from Australia's ABC news.
We provided a helicopter from Balykpan in California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached the Palu.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worry that the dead could reach thousands after the National Agency for the Suppression of Disasters provided access to the city of Dojaga, Sigi and Boutong.
"The sacrifice will continue to grow because many bodies of victims are still torn apart and many others cannot be reached," said the national body's spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's disaster.
The waves that reach six meters have made the pole a stairway that causes mass burial on Sunday.
A military and commercial plane brought help and various supplies.
Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's been a tragedy, but maybe it can get worse."
President Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived at the Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all duties related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia at the beginning of this year was also hit by an earthquake in the Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Niugini Water reported one missing person after the lagoon plane accident
The aircraft operated a flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and delivered one person had disappeared, after being reported to 47 passengers and crews had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
The Niugini River gave a release on Saturday afternoons, which could not identify a man.
The airline said that the party had worked with the local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The civil servants did not respond quickly to a request for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after the plane hit the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
The clerk told me on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline delivered six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What causes a complete accident and sequence of events is still unclear.
Both the U.S. personnel and the U.S. Navy reported a plane landing on the lagoon around the runway.
Some of the eyewitnesses feel that the plane is beyond the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to sink through the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He's been sending out the freaks and screaming, and he's having a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy says fishermen working close to the repaired docks also help rescue by using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sinks in about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Flight Security Network indicates 111 people have died in a registration-PNG accident for the last two decades but not one involving Niugini Water.
Analysts release the line of time women burned alive
The prosecution of the arrest of a man on Saturday in re-checking a man who was accused of making a live fire against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used his cell phone records to collect a number of movements that the defendants did at the age of 29, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some cell phones showing Tellis at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous statement of the defendant, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone at one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck at night, Sanford said he was "a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies told by Telllis were his statement that he knew Chambers for about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate that they know each other within a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, sometimes Tellis deleted messages, calls and contacts Chambers information from her phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
Judge says he hopes the trial will lead to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What's the hip hop spirit?
A trio hip hop group wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who came from Bristol, claimed hip hop moves away from the origin of political messages and removed social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop popular again.

Other black people?!
NY nanny sues couples for attacking after delivering "realistic" messages
A New York babysitter sues a couple for attacking discriminatively after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and states that he's "the other black."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and considered it more like "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new child's nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black as soon as she was on her first day at work in 2016.
"I DON'T KNEW ANY OTHER LIFE," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Miss Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, he said that they were taking out a babysitter, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then returned to Uber.
At this point, Maurice demanded that the couple be compensated for the dismissal, and asked for compensation about $350 a day for the six-month period, in exchange for the loss of the nursing work that he had to work at first, even if there was no contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do anything like that," he said to the Post on Sunday, then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple opposed the claim that they were racialists, said that the workers who were fired Maurice was a reason for doing, they were worried that they could not trust him after he offended him,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped up in "smashing," says his wife's Plasco just two months old gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone in such a condition?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment bank adds.
When the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has made a quick indictment against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
publisher Paddington worried the reader wouldn't have anything to do with the bear talking, the new newspaper revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was received, was explained in a letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing her position, reading it first before publication.
It's funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the children's book with a bear toy, which was very optimistic about the work he had been denied, he added the anniversary of publishing the 60th book that was "sweet fruit" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's quiet enough, and he's not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them though not your whole effort.
I think he's looking at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always praised his own Paddington."
My daughter is dying and I have to say good-bye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors had failed to save her.
"No one makes a quiet call to convey it really bad that he's very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said he would die in two minutes and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors have given to keep his heart from beating slowly and leaving his system.
He's been dead for a while during the handling process and everything feels deadly.
I can only sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't moan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with the other passengers - without realizing what had been going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is drenched and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very hard to explain, but while on that flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Sorry women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones were trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge at Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be connected to get support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that he smiles at the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any further effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can get close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and shut up-- you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who's been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed changes in his behavior.
He's at his lowest point on Christmas Day -- when the kids open their gifts he doesn't see in their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a big trauma to them, but they had to go through it, "That's making a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to get through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in uncertainty when the FBI started the investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for--a time-limited investigation, limited to its scope--we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "destruction" committee in the middle of the board's ruling.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican supporter not want the FBI to investigate?
Their aggression is due to time.
The legislative elections remain five weeks, on November 6, - if, as expected, the Republic did badly, they would become very weak in their opportunity to make the people they wanted to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him to meet his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It's not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean drivers under Kim
The number of people who wandered from North Korea to South Korea has fallen dramatically since Kim Jong-un's reigning seven years ago, urging a member of the Korean Democratic Party.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Union Ministry data, said there were 1,127 last year's rollouts - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border control between North Korea and Thailand and higher rates collected by smugglers was the key factor.
Pyongyang did not give a public comment.
Most Northerners were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have escaped through Turkey, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Thailand treats migrants as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South - which technically is still in war - has greatly increased in the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the two-country leaders met in Pyongyang for a conversation that focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress ever since.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there can't be any way we'll drop our weapons separately," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Council in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "histerism," said he was unsuitable for serving in the Supreme Court
The opposition party president Nancy Pelosi accused the Supreme Court of the Kavanaugh "hissterism" and said he did not fit in a temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman who works like that, they'll say 'hissterism'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the Kavanaugh witness in front of the Judicial Board on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally argued that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, a couple of times he almost screamed and had a hard time talking about his family and his years during high school.
He also openly condemned Democracy in the committee, saying that he was accused of being a "unreasonable and coordinated killing" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed the Kavanaugh witness proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was poor about democracy.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and his attitude toward Clinton and Democracy," he said.
Pelosi objected if he would try to sue if he agreed, and if democracy gained more voice in the People's Parliamentary Council.
"I'd say like this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the High Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that he was a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision against the Health Services or Roe v. Wade, because he was viewed as a conservative sense of justice.
In the high court, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and poor to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is it not so great,' said Pelosi?
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's an ethical nuisance, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It's not strange to me, what do you think?"
He went on, and said, "I am greatly helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who says that she also cries when she is angry, but develops a technique which means that she is angry and starts to cry, she will say to the man who is speaking to her, 'You may think I am sad because I am crying.'
I'm angry."
And then he keeps going.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears came out as a way out of his anger because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, one time I cried with unexpressed anger, was my shoulder was rubbed by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little afraid - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, she was very frustrated, to understand that there was no reason for herself not to run off as president.
"It wasn't a mature decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There are still seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Snow Princess and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he remained in the fundraiser, and so he swore he would not follow the election unless he had managed to collect $2 million.
It's a fight that ends in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave him $1,000 just $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he was not going to launch a formal campaign, he was too overwhelmed by emotion - thanks to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made financial disengagement so difficult and to target the electorate from the delegation, and anger against sexism - making it difficult to speak.
"You might think I'm too nervous," Miss Schroeder recalls about how the press reacted to him.
"You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor's company.
I remember, think, what would they write in my mind?
"Are you crying?"
How the US-Tiochkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The outbreak of trade competition between the U.S. and Thailand was so devastating, and when the fight was still far from over, the split between the two countries might have been beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing the Tychicus key export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant approach started this week with a new tariff that affects $200 billion ($150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods that enter the U.S. through Tiokok.
Beijing has returned every time, recently priced five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
Thailand has begged to combine the United States one-by-one, and the world's second largest economy will not change in a near time.
Telling Washington to back off means following the will, but publicly speaking to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of Turkey.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US trade competition pressures can support China in a long-term positive way by reducing dependence on both economies.
"The fact that the fast political decision by Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic movement in both countries is more dangerous than what we've seen before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that they are ready to return to volunteer refugees and offer help to rebuild countries that have been destroyed by over seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the state of his country was improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists have destroyed to return them as they were.
All conditions now present because refugees return voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and a comprehensive economic decision that makes their daily lives and their livelihoods a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian citizens have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million who still live in that country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
