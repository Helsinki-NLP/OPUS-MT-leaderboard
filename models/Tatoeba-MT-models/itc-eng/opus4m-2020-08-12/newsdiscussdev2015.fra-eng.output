Looks like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is anything...
Yes. Finally, we don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break anyone's nose during drinking games (unless it's part of the game), but we've actually painted black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the first-year student prospectus seemed to me quite typical.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go far beyond misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly that they are trying to make the most of it.
You probably didn't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is populated by former students of these schools for whom rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, former private boys.
From very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are the misogynistic jokes acceptable?
It looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races across campus, theft, damage of goods and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't say that in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
So this interstellar cloud is also ancestral (or not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of your pastry water has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well, we can still consider that the fleet of pasta has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad yet.
A sacred foot of nose to catastropheists and hair-heaters who predict the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the outstanding work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is proof that the warming stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans, but rather about the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally it is not the climate warming that is most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study that you cite and of which you make a generous effort to quote the source, there is little of course doubt that the conclusion is true.
With regard to freshwater problems, I assure you that the French are far from being concerned xD Then you must stop considering ecology as a seamless dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (100 per cent estimate for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, not thank you.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a non-slip dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, it's not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that through the action of the oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 good men would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever it may be?
Probably not me!
In Abbott's small brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving back, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest findings suggest that vegetation would consume 16% CO2 more than any climate model allowed gives priority to replanting.
It makes no sense, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora around the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been planned.
Have you seen the green army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument for plant food is only a false distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but that doesn't mean that it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is fallacious and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
The LandCare budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to get the Liberals back to marginal voters.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants realize less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people must eat them in much greater quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
That this member of Parliament be small is obvious.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from departing from the rules of the XVII.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for no bad world, even if the regulation of the year is not a tax treaty.
Let this lady do a whole thing not to her honor, it seems especially like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who pronounced Mitran...
I recall that during the debate on feminization of names, the "Academie" had become obsolete: "Let us tell Mrs. the guardian or guardian of the Seals" (the post which had never been occupied by a woman before).
Pure machismo!
"Political arena" ....!
The sandshed, the backyard of the Republic repulsed, the marigot of the operating guillats, the table of illusions, etc.
But the arena requires gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly, unwelcome.
Qd the Phalocrate Impist sits on the label and the parliamentary regulation by turning to the basic + civilization under the false umbrella of the good manners, the sanction applies to him "quality" for his partisan header and his measuring of the political arena.
The conduct of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making provocation to make him talk.
So far he was unknown, now he may pride himself on being known as any cancer of a primary class is known.
The academy on the back and we see that the deputies are sensitive to the pocket...
The PUM will have to work towards solving its internal problems and stop causing the outbreaks and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when they tell her what she's not saying.
This Member behaves like a college in the midst of a crisis of adolescence, which causes provocation and whose colleagues go, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel the hours of glue.
and defending it on the basis of a text they haven't even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this forum of MPs UMP.
Mr Judge, I call on two expert witnesses that a few thousand separate years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otarias, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure they get them.
On the contrary, it seems that we spend the majority of our 80 years working, moving and shopping.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lives, but we spend the majority in boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try it again.
It's always an illusion.
Furthermore, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go look for, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – although I adhere to the idea that a lot of bullshit is being heard about animals that are "playing" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "helpful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play based on all physical realities".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Maybe yes, hope makes him live...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy and be able to answer an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and would have even tended to be quite enthusiastic about those who appear to be first-time fools.
But when you see what many have learned at school, especially among the most likely audience to engage in assaults on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of an anchor point.
"the most likely public to engage in assaults on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thoughts.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's messy youth too!
If the reactions were no longer reacting, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I've never learned anything from this at school and I've never raped anyone (and it's not my intention).
Should I be lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do we start reading life when we can't read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralistic assemblies on Twitter, but we should get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're nowhere but to teach moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article won't go soft.
It's not time to joke around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach with a 90-year-old retirement home.
How is it that the more we pay, the less in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more dishes.
Of course, it must not be so.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they've made an effort to put on napps.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good dishes?
Is the Manifesto for everyone only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: a sort of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern "children's manufacturing" systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technological apparatus.
Battery farm?
Where did you get that?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacturing", you have to demand the prohibition of WFP for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am also surprised that the so-called "for all" manifest hasn't yet made this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not the only cathos that show: the other religions too, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was instigating himself violently against the will of the gvt to admit girls to school in the name of "defense of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is to say the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be catho to get inundated with the marketing of belly and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops with that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other as much as others.
But there is no question of tolerating that the child is a movable object.
And this is also valid for GPA-seeking straights.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid flashy moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has marked, I won't talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or bring anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why it won was much more often selected than, we say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12.48 Recommendation 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney right now so you can be forgiven to do so too.
That said it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it from our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the football or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve as much selection as Rooney and B) would set as many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's skills criticism comes from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football skills (not even as an attacker) with Peter Crouch's?
You're doing this without joking?
There are really people in the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his UK team career.
Instead, he played the first retreat, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players like Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that by joking.
In a country where the weapon port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well those at this school just don't agree with the U.S. arms port authorization!
the use of pencil is still suicidal.
Stop screwing around: the girl is 5 years old.
How many children play with guns made at this age at home?
Is that in fact powerful murderers?
Although the weapon port is in the American constitution and that it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that rich children are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and good reason kept svp.
It's a disarming process!
Give it to me. You've got it!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not at all, a premium for the taste of the disease.
Could we start out from the principle that a serial killer can't already have a strange behaviour at the age of 5?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more of this school's mabula than the students!
Let the parents get their kid out of there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely sick.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States but is a part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
Its relative youth?
These blue ribs that men wear don't have a contractor!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson take at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled collar sweater.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but everything seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Otherwise, perhaps?
But what does that look like?
You went ahead with me.
I would have thought a slight knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou did these days.
Maybe by saying "hinder," he meant "shrink."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a gray suit, we could go ahead and pretend that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
It seems that this has been corrected – odd. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone really wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was "hostraching", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still fallen downwards, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is continually strengthened.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become sustainable?
To live there at the moment, I will say that the United States is getting closer to the explosion as the inequalities become crazy.
The political system is literally corrupted by the state of funding of electoral campaigns.
Racial tension, police violence, mass incarceration are of magnitude that we do not imagine in Europe but Americans remain an incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the English financial media said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forgets the essential.
The level of consumption in the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards won't be able to give the change yet...
On the basis of the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the world.
And necessarily the weakest and the poorest, a very large majority of the citizens, will "break" or rather morph.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad makes it lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the moise, it's played at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's policy of mass immigration was designed "to fill the right-wing nose in diversity"
The Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the by-election in a safe seat against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this maneuver return, the pendulum has grown far since the end of the war, and I imagine that it will now go back in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Secure Labour Headquarters, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "defeat", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but she's thin.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent to whatever wins in 2015 as long as Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice creams of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia have gone down hard.
However, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general it is necessary to see the Earth more "paste" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a " fairly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground crust, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which would give a) a whipping blow to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ????
In any case, either the "knock" or the facilitation of access to the area will be located (more or less).
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for climate warming, it seems prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcanicism have an effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Isn't Prudence no longer heating?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we see less.
Hello, the end of the last ice period was also accompanied by increased seismic activity including in the "active" mountain chains where on the very English continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordiale CB
Too often it is unknown that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon causes it to rise or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, deferring, following its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This means that the sliding of tectonic plates, as well as tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving stock, especially since polar caps are reduced by ice casting, thus causing a change in the balance of the land to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human," called the supreme of nature and its self-proclaimed sponsor, being ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created it and of which it has become so separate that it has become harmful, and to itself and to this environment.
And all of this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that exceeds him in the organization of his very viscerals, through an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth’s crust is not based on magma, but on the earth’s mantle, which is made of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look.
Pretentious and arrogant.
That reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Live the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers now.
Too bad you've never been beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The ice creams, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been carried out several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to make a bug eyes in front of a brain in a mouthpiece.
And his story...
It must be hard for you to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that says.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, in itself, therefore not-conformity.
Sure, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and its intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today the individualism structure the whole society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass" !!!
Without making it an unsurpassed horizon, is there not a link with the Cartesian approach to examining what one is being believed to be, what one believes to be.
More than rebellion, doubt is fertile.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-free refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter – reform!
By placing the problem at the level of its nambrillary paranoia, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that supports: Behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this point and being anti-conformist, it's to fight this unlocking.
Marcel Gauchet is being accused of being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebel, ask some...
Blacks and reds, the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who look blushing in their mirror.
In any case, thanks to his controversial challengers for putting Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports rising inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay for the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will greatly increase its net value once he is no longer in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a negro on "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once it has passed the weapon to the left.
Of course, he does not want any inheritance tax.
Would that not be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay the least inheritance tax through super well-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
It will be £100 once he has passed the weapon to the left.
Anything.
He's probably going to promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a no-brain tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition in place.
You could only allow him to be accused of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and imminent collapse will end it, him and the others of his end.
His "richness" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded £1,000,000,000.
We all need to be imposed to pay essential services and repay debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that discipline didactics are useless, of course, I say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement to the math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to establishing a relationship of defiance that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => it takes 1 training to teach skills.
A craft that learns, of course.
But teaching is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making automobile parts.
Pedagogy doesn't get into equation even when we're math teachers!
"Sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently lacking is a real vocation in bcp of those who embrace the teacher
If gifts exist, teaching (I prefer teaching discipline) allows those who have less ease of not making mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The true unknown today are the students of whom 1/3 tell us: learning is no use I already know what I think.
An article by Slate quite well describes the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Institutors..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it's in any case suitable for his time use.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit mine!
It's been years since her show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer and that allows us to listen to on demand whenever we want it!
The internet, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a usb-type adapter behind my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I was wrong about time, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 hours.
Although it's men on Radio 2 day, they could at least put a woman in her antenna schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
His show is anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular cheerleaders, Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show on the evening when the job came back, is not a woman
It's five.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detachable of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a true journalist, but lunch keeps all the ice air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to get tired of it or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have had the same parties that change power and make the country's keys in less good condition than they did.
The campaigns are very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with further isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnasium, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't hurt, they don't drift, they don't interest politicians...
But thank you don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, they are under-men, sociology is good to look at them.
They have very high rates of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculturity and ignorance so much that it still has huge potential for growth, it really needs to be bad for not doing better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on poverty, fear of everyday life, the fear of each other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a wretched humanity.

Here's what's happening.
Who are they?
"forgotten" actually is less and less of a resource =>low of staffing.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen to you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by this is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being questioned, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and that's great - it's necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is to say, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfill their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize gender roles.
The money is talking, and if a sex isn't up to the next one!
The profits mock the life you lead.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The profits mock the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women aged 20-45.
Well said my sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) must be equal to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do so enough), but it allows our societies to function and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to the point of Msskayadee, how can we take account of the disproportionate responsibilities of women when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who have to "check a box."
The tiger is not Russian only of Western propaganda.
The Chinese alone are responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger to the right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply operating near the border, long-standing exercises prior to the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft in its possession.
Free Tigristan!
You make my day!
Oh, yeah, there you go.
He came to me immediately the same kind of idea.
This is an all-found pretext for arming a few separatists with a view to annexing China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction eventually turn into a betting article directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a slip on the Siberian tiger, but a slip on the sequences of a Putin com operation.
When you expose yourself to the media, you also expose yourself to irony or criticism.
The return of perpetual victimization of Soviet-Poutinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken the pear full with his camel without shouting the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg saint protector of the great Russia has personally and physically engaged in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he shuffled...
Let Hollande get down, that's one thing.
At first sight, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems to be both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to say.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed its teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty sense of complaining about paternalism.
After all, there's no harm in brushing your teeth!
Indeed - basically, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that's correct, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental subsidies offered by the Labour and Revenue Department of the Ministry of Social Development to unemployed young adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a disadvantage to brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the layer of enamel.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an show on the Guinness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth for the longest time and the Guinness judges at the time had strongly discouraged him from doing so because of the adverse effects of a frequent and prolonged toothbrush.
' at first glance ' - very funny.
It seems to me to be a poor experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study has changed the habits of participants who knew that toothbrushes would be studied.
That is why most behavioural studies include such things as double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person who perceives social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give feedback on the times when they brush or brush their teeth (results easily fucked in the air by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterus graft impact this phenomenon?
Nesting itself looks like some kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not wish to bring forth a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori a problem?
It seems to me that this is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not move ever further, without asking the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not without limits and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want it.
This has absolutely nothing to do with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go up to risk taking and manage your little testicles to yourself alone, alone in your little pants to you alone.
to "confer" this magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe if he could still give love?
The current complicated circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about his communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What's going to put us as an anti argument: cf here these male reactions all curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodized.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and this is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one way or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women to speak about it.
@Margane: in fact, this has nothing to do with it, and it reinforces the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a member of his family who needs it doesn't have anything anodin either, and it's done!
Please don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's down.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's really no more competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Sports has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for Monday, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for fixing me.
But Rivaldo played well for Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid record goals this season to be able to then return to Old Trafford this summer with a calm conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put an end to his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has defended well and without counting possession, they deserve to win.
I was afraid that the middle of the field would not get too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's game as a whole is getting better.

A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Mummy", well illustrated, appeared in the journal Archaeology 524 last September.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and give what we intuitively guess.
It's no wonder that before we get complicated, it's simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Fascinating!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few times ago that a black-child mummy had been discovered in current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, including geographic and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was prior to the first known African mummies 1,000 years).
Do you have any information on this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little clumsy about reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Was the desert at that time not extending any further than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing where there's only sand right now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to affirm it, even without any proof, to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "his ill-known ancestors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market quacks, which preaches against the mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I believe that there are others who are affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, so as not to get the wrong picture and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, do not hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think that the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good at nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that this is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say yes, it is important.
If they were to return the missionaries absolutely, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its basis for power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-winger in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would well find his place to the religious crazy right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party right to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum .
Many TPE employers - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Mr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the environmental age.
A professor of law at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel Prize in Economics and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, it's true when Dr. Villermé noticed the work of 8-year-old children 10 hours a day, when Canuts were being shot in the eye because of a collective agreement signed.
Ah the good old time...
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your lack of knowledge of TPE's employer business!
His job is not to know the right in all his masters, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscript amounts inscribed on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one could cite much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which choke the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a customer of the Sorbonne.
As a result of the archi-resassessed argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to helve, a serious academic would have plunged into the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then the commentaries (the absence of the French Labour Code could mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
Comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, are aimed at case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when an employee is dismissed, for example....
Who's this complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, agreements, contracts) are in relation to work and trade of unbearable obstacles?

Move on to something else!
See elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but at all costs I had to expose it (without making a bad word game).

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate the extremists of any board (including Zionists) must be set aside
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly's mayorate.
It does not represent either.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting against the truth alone, marginally.
WHAT IS BECOME ASSEMBLY
What does Neuilly City Hall intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who swears to a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls on him to attack this urbanist?
Crime apology?
Can't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges ????
This guy needs care, like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/Anti-Israel plot and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (term whose meaning tends to disappear because of its abuse), these two there, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady would be believed to return to Russia in the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of very gross stupidity.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of September 11, we talk about cognitive dissonance regarding how to address the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely farfetched truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the adaptation of this theory to stand out from it (as in the case of extreme religious).
As a result of a logical and ineligible flight forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a complete but not comprehensible one seems to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a multitude of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to respond.
There are actually very farfetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is rising," but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think this is an attack - are you going to have a drink and relax?
It's better to risk this than to put my mental health in danger by abstention.
The Government is putting an end to the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist tips based on unreliable statistics.
Two average drinks per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council of Health and Medical Research should work together (around one or two drinks, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to tax them thoroughly, like smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink and he didn't smoke, and cancer took him to 64.
So I will continue to drink my two red bottles on Friday and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old thing that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to the risk of cancer today?????
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
She refuses to run when we could run and run each other.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing-yes yes.
Both of them destroyed the F1 on the pretext of security.
Let's hope he gets better than Schumi or less Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but focus on point number 1: it is not the F1, but the channels of the circuit that have refused to advance the departure so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly, +1
I just want a quick and prompt recovery to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that had occurred between payroll cranes and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had said so for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the FIA allow these maneuvers without leaving the safety because?
I can't accept that the risks of the job or the lack of a chance when we haven't prevented the foreseeable.
That was the accident.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "a ban on crossing the area" but is intended to signal a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family to be on TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more trapping the next round and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, can even get at a "low" speed compared to a normal rhythm.
But, well, we cause in the vacuum there, until we've seen the images, we can't make a statement.
I don't see much about what this changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before that happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there are still jobs where we have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are people injured since Canada is almost empty.
There may be wounded animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and the Toronto agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as if by charm and these types of trains often cross urban areas populated.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains travel very, very often in one day.
In addition, as the routes often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have been trying to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on it last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Canadian Railways Society are expected to attend the next Conference on Hazardous Products in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, impasses on the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, otherwise what good is talking about the sex of angels?
"God said: it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (Muslim countries but not of importance): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words: obey the priest pastor rabbi imam and make your prayers, it will be better!

Yes, this is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in some way trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather pallet right now ) or that of the free market ( clearly supported by the state when it needs to flourish ) ,etc .
Great ideas arising from religious emergences.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is on the tow and expresses himself in the schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even though it also carried out forms of challenge.
The theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knew no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misconception of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit calls for the hatred of the believer.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately the most numerous) who "read" the texts and hold it only from humanism and values common to all humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the foolish and evil application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling to kill "meeks", "unfaithfuls", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in situations of self-defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is a religious requirement that makes today almost unanimous in the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to get out of this is that it caused a general conviction.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the clip?

An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you took your eyes off the TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, beginning with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and that are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!

Almost all of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass who are victims of military bombings, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to go to explicitly designate the separatists is in the octanesque line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the wicked Russians

If I understand your words well, the wicked are the Ukrainians and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document that you quote about MH17: "this ticket is absolutely not meant to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
To Alexandre Kastals: where do you keep these clarifications about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (it unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to it)?
Uncontrollable elements (possible to say anything)?
Alleeeeez in Romania!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez in Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not ceased to denigrate Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperative", which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would whiten the money at its own will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about EUR 1 million), then paid them, but apparently he was ill advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have resulted in a conviction without a sentence) and therefore took 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial also went from prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, star manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali is also serving him a penalty for trying to bribe (and then conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, to be able to win the title and win the League of Champions jackpot.
The team he tried to weld were our neighbors at Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions, while they were relegated.
I still like this moment.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document implying that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor uneducated guy, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalistic idiots today.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and shop windows, and where they branded racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.

If it was Sarkozy who did this, we would have heard the left screaming like a big sick man.
But since it's nice Hollande, friends of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but it's all low.

It was the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they didn't owe their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers do not seek work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment hub generalize the control of the unemployed early 2015?
I hope that in the wake of the tax point, it will also generalize the absolute control of the so-called common plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrates, tax evasions, stealing patterns, and other malandrins.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or pluutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true when we have class: we treat the population of bedbugs and toothless
At each new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who most often do not even charge for an acknowledgement of receipt, was it automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support by the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I will add that this government's "socialist" patronship appears to me as an insult to Jaurès or Méndès France's memory.
Have we read here an article of the chained duck?
It is learned that a unemployed person may remain without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It is learned that controls have resulted in the removal of persons who for more than half had no unemployment benefit.
So we wonder how people can be controlled that we never see.
One wonders what the penalty is for anyone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if one can admit that this reform will make it more effective, one wonders how it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person may remain without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means."
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we chase them out of the EU?
The EU was the only economic origin and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "police of thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It has no economic significance.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the referees of the corrupt mafia that is UEFA.
The best solution would be that the entire East leaves this lucrative organization rotten and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This antiracism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality?
What the hell is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for playing Blatter's comedy and his men.
This has been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he have hoped to be twisting small symmetrical sentences, just a story of keeping the polemic?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there was, there are and there will be people who use oil to cast on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western states are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
Decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, action would have to be taken against the Israeli over-armed occupying Israeli identity state based on oppressive colonialist destruction.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not at all in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian of its German inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr. Take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But, as for Israel, we must also question history, its allies and its supporters in order to discover truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been an altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
Gaul was colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine there is much discrimination based on origin.
Furthermore, the Israeli State is defined as a "Jewish People" whose no non-Jewish people can be part of.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jewish people, from which the dispute arises.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jewish people.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that need to be stopped ignoring.
Primo, the European Zionist project (colonising to take over Palestine) involved deposing Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has missed biting from the start.
Their terne result will give them what their fingers bite from.
It should begin its rehabilitation by small bites.
I hope he hasn't lost his appetite for the game.
We tolerate so much subtleties, including racial insults and physically hard spots in football, but we sanctioned Suarez too hard.
I would like to see him return to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molars.
Football is a contact sport where the tacles exist and yes, therefore players get hurt.
Getting his teeth back into the flesh of an opponent for the benefit certainly does not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for having made a similar gesture.
This is the third time Suarez does this.
If you're biting someone at work.
What would the consequences be for you?
I knew someone was gonna die.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I am, in fact, slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he'd bet he was looking forward to coming back to play full teeth.
All these words games about Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost died of hex.
A prerequisite for a good school course is the respect of the students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents teach such respect to their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good institutions, those who progress their pupils, parents are considered partners, not emms..
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the taf.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Focusing on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
From then on, the action will remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could do a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be necessary for actors (profs, hierarchies and ministries) to play their role and not be permanently involved.
We can disband a troop that is breaking down to relaunch it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the first role of the school.
To pass on knowledge.
And if parents are required, it's the school that teaches their children.
What is the minister who dares to put in place what was called the Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beautiful suburban east?
It's a beaut, it's clear, but I think it's Willoughby's, and so from the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
really true.
That's right.
A little boy from Aloysius.
Its electorate is the seat of Sydney North.
Indeed a beaut from the North Coast !!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He's going through a grunt these days.:(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis on his hunger.
You'd be rather gratifying too if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illegal life benefits will forever remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to submit a budget and then gave up.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and call for state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fears about the outcome.
And so much worse for employment in France that she has nothing to do, which comes from vegetables always ready to break when their corporation has losses on markets, especially external...
It's precisely because their lobbying didn't work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time limit or an arrangement for marpol, no doubt the project would have ended.
After that, to know if it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law in spite of everything, it would be nice for "the world" to look at it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn the tax and dry centers.
They want state aid.
That they didn't have it seems to me to be normal.
Well, to the extent that he armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it's normal to wait for one inch of the state.
Or it is condemned to tolerate the fact that the British monopolize the market.
It's the choice.
An eternal French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people different from the average Parisian live.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-sighted.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
This is and after they will create the Breton Pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain bretons.
That makes sure they're going to lower costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They always hated everything about the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which was always closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel’s solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "hate everything that relates to prog," since they just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to Genesis's spirit of the '70s," I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he had various degrees of participation and claim to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour does not have the right to gather a lot of demos in half finished and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing but fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and quite in the spirit of Genesis of the '70s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, they're afraid.
Yes, this is one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been made if they had not had their commercial pop success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have such an interesting story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good notes.
I would say, however, that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it is adorating progressive music over time.
A person with personal interest screams "prejudice": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a shocking success.
There will always be a difference of size between a death penalty and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his misconception of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
I mean, they don't have an excuse.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
It is necessary to have a good spirit of dispute about the common mortals in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has done since his false sense of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge among the relatives of the innocent victim: a false sense that will never prevail those who wisely decide the death of others from the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestals.
However, to try to balance the analysis, it might also be argued that the death penalty, often, has carried out wild violence, which he has enjoyed, against people who are materially friendly, who have made the costs free of charge.
Those close to these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain at ease with the disappearance of the one who was the burrow, sometimes the torturer, being loved and who sleeps at night.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The heart one.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, it would be believed to read stories of another era, of ancient things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that clog, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
The same for the other two "Excellent American Romantics" quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overboard.
I thought you got the white one, man.
What's wrong with that?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this terrible Bellow, who received him the prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel courts have decided that if we were to have an American winner, we could have a racist [light].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "genie novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph on the other hand...
Which did you read?
How many books from DeLillo did they read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever end Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's of simple interest.
It was a trait of humor, "the law", not a request for definition.
Between the text and the mind, it appears here that the lady acted in the sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one asks what the term "conflict" is doing there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope it'll be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not prevented it from danger.
After that, we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only looking for tranquility.
The floodproof areas that become constructible from day to day the next day when a major construction program is going to start, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "now there are no more flooding thanks to regulatory dams."
Now you have to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
On the ground, on the whole of the promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer, here, the interest?
Exit the calculator and you will dream of life that you could have been in place of Mrs. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former Chair of the Urbanism Commission, who grants permission to build!
The two mothers of the triumphant Sarkozysm are old and real estate.
I am on the left and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but svp, not from low political or low blows all azimuts, we are not in there in a battle of pungent balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what the hell are you living in?
The U.S. isn't a shithole.
Yes, U.S. cops are hardened by the roots they deal with every day.
Of course none of them ever does anything but the cops "come to piss them off because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is needed to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the calculation.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this your first time in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it's clearly you who don't pick anything up - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that racism is in the United States (it's not oissive speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent to which the tension is rising.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, which is where the treatment of Occupy there is.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me with the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate those in charge, make them talk, raise confidence.
That man goes to the Elysée doesn't really have anything surprising.
Then, what counts is the replication, the verification, the analysis.
And here we understand that the sarcolátres have a concern to do.
@Munstead, our current president was elected on a wave of anti-sarkozysm based on cases raised from all parts (a non-place and no conviction) which appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 referrals in correction), two Dutch friends journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, political, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not teleguided !!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is unworthy!
From the extract that I could read, VA's article only drags the spray.
I even laughed so rude.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of ending because journalists are not "strained" to the secret of sources, are they?
Unlike the fact that there does not seem to be any connection between VA and power while there seems to be a conjugation between the world's power and journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are well in the face of a state scandal that would cause the fall of the government involved in any other democracy.
That is why this editorial to the barbarians, which says a long time about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the oyster would go well with the smoked herring!
It is simply for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people who came in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperative, refusing even to give dishes simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter his place of worship although she told him that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't comfortable"
As we all know, if we let him do so, the United Kingdom will continue to go right - whoever sets limits and challenges this must be admired even if he is a director of pub:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour has done, particularly on the left?
The liberalisation of a country, the NHS this NHS repeats, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to well feed the nose on the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-est-permission, the politically correct killing of freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is a center left and not a communist, I said this to joke, which I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Let your arguments be prepared as much as you want, but what I asked you, are specific examples of left-wing policy, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked for, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour did, which is particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another diner, that of the money.
We'll make pretty savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still has a meaning in Europe, should this do so?
Curiously, the Commission is not looking at the unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully market.
In term, this means that whole corners of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
Every sacrifice, including a country's avant-garde, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will need to be addressed one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to make the SNCF's accounts clear.
The French state has long resigned.
Regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means of forcing the sncf to meet its commitments.
However, using public money without waste is essential to these days when public resources are restricted.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what might be the competition of TERs!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that is the case, should he certainly not be head of the wolf?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to an end to pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would seem to me that it would make sense to start the process of separation between your life and the complications you inherited.
Looks like they're doing it, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones do surface, have you thought about a "flight" plan so that you can cut your life and your future?
Financial problems have a bad effect, but with a supportive real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He looks vindicative and persistent.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to offer support to help her get back to work and pay for food.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage the disappointment if he does not hold his appointment.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a parent/child relationship, they will know who will thank you when they are older.
I'm of the opinion that children end up understanding who's wrong, if they're allowed to see things by themselves.
Another little effort you're close to Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization has disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does in the least so-called social, fiscal but also environmental has an immediate competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All politics are looking for is growth, La Croissance.
International coordination is needed, but by then ...
It is not the climateoscopics that produce C02.
It is everyone who heats up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in housing that they must have built, those who buy industrial products that they have needed to produce and transport.
It is not the climate-septics that have shown against the ecotax, but the truckers.
There is no climate policy and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate-septics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
Political action is also needed (other sources of energy, reducing car dependence, etc.).
And politicians act in part on the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise by McArtur made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But good it may be funny to say that the expression is Terminator.
"The greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the dogma of the RCA seems to know what it is about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo du Guardian: How long before someone blames immigration?
I blame the crap that took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the liars of the Democrats.
Or the crooks of Democrats.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or aircraft to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Sex with monkeys is better?
You think it's a virus?
I do not advise you to apply for a prescription for antibiotics.
He hired Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse hired Ebola in Spain.
Damn it, actually!
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom is dependent on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic basins, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and suit, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating and eat this sandwich with cheese).
Don't be such a jerk.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or is it not done deliberately?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a small minority of individuals to spend good time in space doing gallipettes and snoring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The television reality has thus not been invented and the authorities certainly expect a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and to delight the media coverage of Western royalties accustomed to tabloid maternity.
Maybe they should come down to the ground and see that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we don't send men or women into space to make galipettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
A lot of things that improve our daily lives come from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a cash wrench.
the ball pen that works the tip in the air (for example, to write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treats?
To participate in the manufacture of a wasteful item?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working for work means nothing and represents emptiness itself.
Ah if the last one played high tech.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make it possible.
You know, people who work on what, including more and more private companies, especially to carry the cargo to the station.
If you think you're buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think they're buying plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy plastic guns in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to understand people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt the author/editor only to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the registration (if any) meant?
Typical misreporting, it's late on the fact that "it's only a plastic sword" and not on the inspirational jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The family of Dirani, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, and terrorist groups seeking to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped arguing about the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small blankets given in the fast restaurants can penetrate the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculous thing the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a plastic sword," the facts as you have stated them actually support his argument.
On occasion, I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes all the sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night long!
I like the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful new developments, often technological, give many people the idea that it is a right and a need to benefit from them, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a standard cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weighs on budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Solidarity Energy Pact, which allows to isolate the fillers of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy providers in fact!).
Simple but unknown even though more than 3000 houses have been so isolated this year!
Interesting about this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call it and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, test water-saving showers and recommend the placing of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3) by 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that no longer manages to produce enough surpluses (which it would have then redistributed in the form of real income increase) so that these surpluses pay the increase of the expenses you rank in the category "compulsory expenditures".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can force, increasingly strongly decade after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (physically), energy is what makes it possible to achieve any physical transformation.
Since it is fundamentally to transform, energy is to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy needs.
This means that any increasing constraints on energy generation (improperly called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forcing production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precariousness and the fact that we arrive, or not, to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very formally, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only get worse in the years and decades to come (the IEA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the peak production of conventional oil, including cheap oil, has been achieved.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very strong energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't have anything to do with it.
Take this to France!

Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As previously noted: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yeah, nice work, guys.
Although many Englishmen like to mock Scottish people when they only lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to tournaments when they come to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if we play against them;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because now that the "goldish generation" retires, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the early XI, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class," is David Beckham, a little ephemeral, perhaps, but I think that if he would tackle a potato in excess like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget its athletic constitution, in fact, by talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never make fun of Scotland.
I tend to surprise myself by observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my opinion, was really "international class" is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It's about which Juppe would have had a hard time asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not sure he'd get them if he asked them...
You mean people are coming for a good shot?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his Members' allowances...
I would like to ask myself, above all, the question of what he can say in his conferences.
How to reduce the deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will not consider asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are most of the time free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people are actually working and that the results presented in their conferences - for free - are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, the report of these two figures is upbuilding.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
I mean...
It's all light for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being blamed for making money????
I'm far from being one of his fans, but he's being blamed for being wrong (or fraudulently) running his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a completely legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Rule No. 1 of Epidemiology: to isolate.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human life is more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I can see them forbid all flights and ships heading towards the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that say...
What a shame that international media panic over Ebola is no longer being used to discuss less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all under threat.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It is such a sad newspaper article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Much more intelligent comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all help to better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches, and differences in the gender role that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get into it, let's think and write, we don't just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are unable to provide a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as beheading - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate only making it a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" beyond the meaning.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which may give him a degree of "validity", but in this case it obviously does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "growing" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, leaving behind its founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, lets it appear?
For a territorial or other electorate, money does not count.
I read continually that the territorial civil service increases its strength, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, indeed.
There will probably be lies and truths, to separate us from the good grain of beer.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so many economic miseries.
It is true that they have never had anything to manage the people of Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficit they have funding needs that only concern and only the investments they make.
Forced to use concepts too blur the press as the World makes the game of all obscurantism.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the hiring of employees (for example, to make nice rounds-points) has a growing and incompressible burden (compulsory charge until death, as living + retirement work), these communities are large in investments.
The staff member's status should therefore be abolished, prior to the decrease in staffing.
And also responsible mayors financially.
It is fabulous that intercommunals would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the number of community members and it is the opposite that occurs, proof that adding one level is not effective without removing others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionised, perhaps it would be time to react.
They would not rather remain imprisoned, worse encased, in the administrative fabric, would it appear!
Let's even try it, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of Veme has led with its providential men.
This really started with Petain.
Then he went on to get to the series "to the end of breath" coming loudly about it.
Why aren't they going to live in an apartment of $250 million in Monaco above a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the genre "it's white fault".
"Answers" not "Answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry up to be the first one.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to pass.
We now agree that the modern Homo Sapiens has evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight miles) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to be on the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Give up!
2017:Transformation into a comfortable hotel of golden closets for future retired people in the Republic?
Moving from the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the Nantes and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military are going to clean up the flu from the last minute elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of the patients are civilians, from all over the world?
The London Wasps?
I felt sorry for their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It turns out that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the other side.
In addition, outside travel for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the trouble of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other premises, did not do us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no problem with supporters and that until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage taken up by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent issues of the CCFC, but that must be a good gulf.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest I don't know anyone who does it except some Wasps fans at work.
Will they and a few thousand other people in the South-East probably follow them away or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good extension.
But who cares?
But then, why are ALL computer systems not based on these concepts???
+because a giant mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because all systems don't require them, +because there's no ++ magic wand....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is to be the first on the segment.
The work of G.

Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been in an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It seems they're reasoning with making more profits, and not making healthier dishes and the best price-quality ratio.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, be careful that people don't have too much scissors.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you have to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It's not just the taste of salt, it's also affecting the way they cook pasta.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to the company kitchen.
Are there any family restaurants and are they offering tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal accident at work that has been misdirected.
A promising young man, learned to steal, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man looked at everything and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
To be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
I totally agree!
That's funny.
The desire to discover it is obvious and hardly excusable and humiliating at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to discover it is difficult to excuse it.
That's what makes me kind of a 15-year-old kid.
During the trial, the child's father complained that he would never see his son again but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really a victim in this story?
What are you coming to mix everything up!!!?
The boy's father was convicted of what he did.
Regarding the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and the guilty, he knew exactly that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So pay him for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, that's a little bit to my mind.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
That's what made it sound like.
If the opportunity arises, go on holiday in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
I've done it twice, wine, landscape and food are great.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
It is important to note that German vine growers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they must really work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region to be recommended - the Franconia, the Rhine Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or maybe it's the other way around, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled to the property are so complex, mildness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a lobster thermodor next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new Baden drys that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (hew, I don't really think that it's always true or evocative, except if I address myself at the age of 40 - who, as I say, have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Gracia would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who studied there.
In democracy, the management of public health should be put to the vote by the House of Deputies: these department shamanships held by the barbichette, and these decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in Green Sun: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Moreover, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets as they can no longer go to the market.
Actually, find a job for our unemployed, a real job, and you won't have any deficit problems!
For the elderly, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, who are missing, will not be able to hold this demographic transition alone...
So geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (this is already the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the entire model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that is best known in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really screwed.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to their height.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated differently than in the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase public service supply in other hospitals than to maintain two-speed medicine.
The Val is a center of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing would be a mistake, a sign of more of walking towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The hospital day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abolition of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is only one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than the one he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizens is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkablely high standards, with obvious hard consequences.
Why?
It seems to me to make two measurements.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all persecution and abuse and war that drives people out of their country and forces them to seek help in Australia.
If you don't want people to come by boat, then you have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted for 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, Nimrod!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little supermarket when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the abuse that was still taking place.
Several European countries have since put off the deportations of Tamils with links with the LTTE, thinking that they are at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for assessing asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with LTTE links be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
All right, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've gone to the coconut with so much periodicity.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
Didn't you have a health insurance in the States?
So I wouldn't have been given a year's treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses painful his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes earth.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah !!!!!!!!!!!!
There was still little, we were told that the Ebola kills so quickly that an epidemic of great magnitude was impossible (there is all scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of reduced persons was zero.
The weirder we get, the more I'm scared.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or even three weak but not nothing.
Finally, it is a scientific fact, the more a virus is fast mortal (in general) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes comes out of the so-called Spanish flu.
After c is the 40th general to save humanity..
Is there not something obscene to make media advances of certain brave and virtuous Westerners, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African patients who are not known for the trade, bravery or virtues?
This, of course, highlights the action of NGOs and encourages their assistance, but the repetition of the announcements is a terrible bias.
Freedom of expression, so dear to conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they had never imagined that their conservative penchants would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem will actually become out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Market Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just an emergency black fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope Australian voters come to see this excellent russia for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
It explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Fund for the term markets for medical research.
However, it is a loss to the sick, a loss to the elderly and a loss to the low-income.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "liar rodent" and Telstra's Term Market Fund were excellent guardians.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell for the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as a note.
If only she could dissuade her from having a buzz on her constantly..
The worst fate for a career policy: not being recognized on the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently high to manage it.
How good the "provincial" sense is!
We're living a hate time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdote says is sarkozism in the pure state: small, mediocre ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each side of the road to show that he is well-guarded in public order), rudeness and carelessness to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become unwilling to carry a firearm and a badge, would thus have any leisure to exercise their self-proclaimed role as vigilantes.
But who is Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I want this agent who didn't know about Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the sake of
Not okay, thanks to her we laugh well...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she'd have to be invented!
But it's easy, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this occasion, N.
Morano manifestly done in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she faced, and who would have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes ma'am, of course ma'am, immediately tell me, madam, in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman".
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians has become too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think Isis is going to go over them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies here now no one does.
As for industrial civilian deaths, nothing competes with the Western war machine.
I disagree, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two Iraq wars would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, elderly people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred sanctions to the transfer of the "war machine".
Were you also the type of guy who preferred sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsequentially in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - probably a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste any time marking their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission GQ that they had just erected five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place hard and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bombardment either, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission was targeted like this.
Good point, I've actually forgotten that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent disorders in Ukraine the economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussein refused to allow objective inspectors to see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to stress the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimates that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400 000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths in under five years was approximately 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctioned deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course, it must be feared, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop making it as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is essential and despised to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fanciful arguments, we should explain what serious problems may arise for a child adopted or designed with a gift of gametes.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes you came out of, you could return them, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest developments in LDCs (e.g. uterus) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed APG.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire for children justify these acrobats and that has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
Obviously, we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that we can't have children when we want them.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
However, it is less serious than to be born or become very disabled, to contract a serious illness, to lose all her children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, it is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of the others!
In a society that no longer withstands any form of frustration, where the child becomes well-consuming, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a whim where one could use the other according to his or her goodwill.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
