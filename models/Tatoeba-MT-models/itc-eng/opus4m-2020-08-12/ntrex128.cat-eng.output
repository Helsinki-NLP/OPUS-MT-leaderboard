Members of the Galles assembly concerned to "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the House expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "was dating Twp or Pwp."
For non - Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For its part, a Welsh Conservative member claimed that his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the letter "u" in English in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drafting the legal deletion to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will of course be made by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Wales Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was decanted by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to achieve a consensus can lead to a complete misunderstanding for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the course of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on their country's change of name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided on an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's cease to sound: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither of us are left."
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that is obtained from the sale of assets may not last as long as his leaders foresee, "and eventually they will return to their place of departure."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is totally unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally formed left during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main commercial streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's felices made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they charged the cart.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to his St. Martin's church, described the trolley as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who made the reel sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also observed that it was the first trolley in the world that was played by a black-breeded musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest trolley in the Church River 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What did sound like in St. Martin's over the last few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July all expressing its concern that the diocese "to transmit costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while looking for locusts in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the pond season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had a half hour of knocking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that he first thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he cried 'I've been bitten!'
I've been bitten!'
He had all the clavicle torn apart," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'," adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in a bad state.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press release, rescuer Larry Giles commented that I worked for a few weeks that had detected a shark in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatized wounds in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them do not consider themselves dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty product corridors in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are just part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves about GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors are staying behind, and will be tested at 11 shops across the country to expand to more shops next year if the test becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's claims he will double his beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique make-up products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop retail chain, in addition, will open concessions to two shops in Sainsbury's, the first one last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, shops will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch the sales of groceries and increase the profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its departments of beauty and pharmacy products resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all came to an early conclusion that he did not agree on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's from his business of 281 pharmacies in Celesio, owner of the chain LloydsPharmacy, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the overall plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment of our customers.
We have invested in workers specifically trained who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "sniffy" after Holly Willoughby goes back to a deal of 11 million GBP
Dragons' star Den Peter Jones left "furicious" after television host Holly Willoughby turned behind an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to engage in the joint home products and accessories business.
The business of these two media figures had been compared to Gwyneth Potter's Goop brand.
37-year-old Presenter This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' star Den Peter Jones infuriated by withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand-set business to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furiated" when the blonde star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his empire center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth 1.5 million GBP, meant that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane heading towards one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where we would see him for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to go back left without words all the parts involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods at its Marlow station ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this Morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the important investment that had been made in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility of delays for her release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in serving as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the TV producer in Baldwin.
Willoughby will be M&S's next brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity program for the ITV.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We will not comment on their business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider to be "little of a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did he give up Trump so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of voice of a newscaster:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore on June was declared a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented on it on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" by the United States to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed that the United States continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s viewpoint, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we're keeping this big relationship."
According to Trump, their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this corner full of people, we would have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared necessary in order to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutope, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies were allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although refuges have been built in Aceh in the case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in case of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that he contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for the earthquake victims is now heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and he has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, the Joko government is facing next year's re-election full of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displacements are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with bricks, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the goal of the quarter with a long shot ahead of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at the minute 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible jump aimed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a big elevation as it propelled itself into the right cross of the gate.
The ball finally began the descent above a full jump Kepa Arrizalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I only tried to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a touch and didn't think too much, I just got involved in kicking."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the break after marking a goal at minute 25 through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the move, the Blue team leader came back to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost the middle of the field and pushing towards the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Then he made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard passed the defense to end up in the second pole with a stick with the left leg where the porter of the Liverpool Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League group phase next Wednesday at 15:00 in St. Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings collapsed because of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on a press wheel.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbing woman
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stabs on Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police have asked the locals to see or hear something about the crime presented to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statements: "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to call everyone near John Street at Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to pick up anything through the car's onboard camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he ran out of words.
He's telling residents to spend hours until they can come back in.
He felt like a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated like the crime scene.
A woman appeared at the crying scene.
Don't stop repeating "It's terrible!".
At 14:00, two police vans were in the area with another truck parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the agreed area controlling the floor block.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously through 0800 555 111 and mention the issue 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite the story"
Its disappearance would be a sort of poetic justice for the destruction of the most pure style of the Taliban of many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bogery" and an "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster's palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was not ordained or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his forefather he did in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation remains a historical subject of debate.
What is true is that the 17th century mid-term conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pig court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs into a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As you know, he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave a court of neighboring pigs.
According to him, there was a large male pig in his mouth in the court.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilver had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn apart and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as mentioned in Guiyang's evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor by his cousin.
One market official commented on the evening news that the pig was locked and isolated to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their deaths.
Though very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious wounds.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg seized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "decadent."
"They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't come up with the idea of hurting.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all over the south-west of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring torrential rains all over North Mexico and South-West America for the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Eastern US time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the east direction to the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture will interact with the near depression to generate torrential rains across the south-west over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the south-west, especially much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that there will be laughter, as the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the dispersed character of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to turn into uncontrolled rivers, as well as storms can bring wind and cloud of dust to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that there are total rainfall levels above 50 mm, which could cause smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin arriving in isolated tropical rainheads in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will disperse to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October there will be several significant temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic cools, although the Tropics will remain quite warm.
This can sometimes lead to drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
There have been temperature differences of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with heat in much of the central and eastern US area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern plane area to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities for temperatures to be recorded above average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, who allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual schedule of Friday due to a tour of the events at the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a charge investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, said he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The audience figures were not immediately available for other streams that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people you see from his office.
In perspective, this is a audience similar to that of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most heard channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the one-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS earned 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being rebuked by protesters when he was trying to get up on an elevator to go to a court hearing.
Flake stayed several minutes with her sight down while she was on live TV on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"You think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he had more to say in front of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcast chains were already broadcast live at the time when the Committee on Judicial Affairs had to vote whether or not it was going to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the appointment next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations she had with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The choice by Flake had an influence, since it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "to play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former foreign minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Brexit Chequers Plan, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "all absurd".
Wayde Sims Murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player in the U.S.L.U. team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered their glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the WAFB subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to killing Wayde from one shot, according to the police.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge District forensics office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the operating group of fugitives from the state police of Louisiana, the state police criminality lab, the Southern University police and the local citizens for the assistance they provided in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his appreciation to the law enforcement forces of the area for his "diligence and to seek justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
About six feet (1.98 m), he was a player and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebots to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destructed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow."
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A volcano spits out ash in Mexico City
The spitting ash by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several streptures and tremors that had recently occurred.

Geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 rocked the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in support of independence were confronted with the riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals held by the riot police began to throw eggs and paint in dust, causing dark dust clouds to appear in the streets that are usually invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, riots took place with the police, who used their pods to contain violent protesters.
For several hours independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters who called "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people were to be assisted by minor injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independentist mentality one year after October 1 was held a referendum considered illegal for Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, as the opponents of secession boycotted majority voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
Independentist groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The protest also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independentist demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had a lot of hope about the possibilities that Catalonia enjoyed independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best times.
I saw my parents cry with joy for voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
In spite of achieving a vital victory, although for a short time, in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independentist parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their leading leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile pending trial for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded a demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and said that the conflict has been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension only increases," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial at the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after covering a house with a car
Three men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone fired a bullet at the car.
A game of Menga wins Livingston for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston won
Livingston, who had climbed the category this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers that it is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the club in the Ibrox district.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team is second in position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerard's, on the other hand, still don't win home at the Premiership this season, next Sunday they'll face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, meanwhile, expands his invict-to-all lifeline to six parties, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitor's direct game
The Holt team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, since its direct game caused all sorts of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defense, but he wasted his time when he met in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out by lying down to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, which crossed the gate.
The locals were already well advised to let Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble at isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whispered a fault against Rangers' interests and Livingston opened up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could touch it first and end from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a doorkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work along the party,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop doing credit.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor's doorkeeper stopped with his feet on one occasion from Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination game from Livingston.
Rangers went on to hang up again and again in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and they claimed two penalties, one for a supposed Halkett entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for hands, both of them were rejected.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great outcome for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending path.
His game style and staff have almost not changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be waiting for Menga throughout the party.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely did not know how to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (just once they clearly passed the local defense), and that the Rangers, who is on the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Erdogan aggress reception in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated because of such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's income in the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of views that is around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called dictator by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies on a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the street crucible Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident took place months after another cyclist died in a runaway case at Childers Street, 1.6 km from the Saturday crash site.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents wounded in an altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security prison, according to the headquarters.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 09:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still remains.
Specialized "returned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the strike, where eight prisoners were involved.
Officers had to be looked up for slight injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We've deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident in Long Martin prison, which is still going on.
Six employees have had to be treated with wounds.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, we are clear that those responsible for this dispute will have to report back to the police and could have to spend more time in jail."
There are over 500 inmates at Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the prison head had to be served in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot agents made a statement in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which central staff was attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (drought areas could be benefited)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early this week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of the south-west, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national meteorological service has already issued river alerts for Mondays and Tuesdays west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and to approach it on Monday night with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the national hurricane centre provide for 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points that would record up to 150 mm in Arizona's Mogollon.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Conca, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated dots up to 100 mm.
For areas at risk of rivers, the pink rain may become very good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause of concern, some rainfall may prove to be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the lower California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
So he's expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of rivers.
According to weather.com, "they are expected from 75 to 150 mm of total rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at first thing in the morning of Tuesday morning with tropical depression, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach south of Utah well entered Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what remains of it is very heavy precipitation in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the Southwestern desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane center.
Rain is expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, in addition to land-slaving in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stabs at Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds at Midsomer Norton's Superior Terrace, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he's "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have called for any person who might have some sort of record of the facts on the mobile phone to be contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the Messiness and the Wrath" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "fed the meanness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh declared in front of Congress Thursday, denying strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual abuse of her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also declared in view of his allegorical claim.
The president said on Saturday that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizen," he commented to the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the rate of participation of Republican voters in the half-term elections.
"We're five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually going," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held at the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as late Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the leaders of the Republican party.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met on Fridays for a festival held on the beach in Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast by nightfall, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke to the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, smashed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by sea open at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
Some people climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and survived, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency that appreciate the amount of shops and destroyed buildings, turned and collapsed bridges and a water-filled mosque.
The replicas continued rocking this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes series were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (PPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donjaga, nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came" from Dojaga, says Nugroho.
Over 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the officers said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of an amateur social network share, you can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts across the sea, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the recording immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in the power supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuaters continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Dojaka were able to get safely to the city of Palu, where employees lay in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many homes destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although relief groups did the sad gesture of initiating relief work, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fund-raising, supply and staffing of foreign staff can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arrariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘well, it’s a national disaster, we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared.”
While I was spending the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope that the miracle and their loved ones would come to an end to the devastating story of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandage, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
Some thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier in Newport where the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an automatic cashier in Newport where the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy pointed out in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM into the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole him a money bag for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper changes its name to Ye.
Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
He used this alias as his eighth album, which was published in June, in 41 years ago.
The change takes place before the program appears on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation for his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio broadcaster.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more like a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have been renamed.
In Sean Combs he was known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without a script and in capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when the country is soon to complete the 50th anniversary of a cruel retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when student leftist movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
"As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, a specialist investor and professional in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in I.A. matter, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in AI in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become world number one with respect to AI innovation in 2030.
“Dupplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next IA field advancements,” said Lee.
“Dubling funding could double the opportunities that the United States will achieve the next major discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that beat the American player of Othello with the best ranking and later served as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively rated previous technological competitions by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the U.S. work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors at AI," he added.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
“China’s National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public bodies in the United States give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to participate industrial sector collaborators and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA has announced an investment of US 2,000 million in an initiative called the Next AI.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently spends over 100 million USD a year on research at AI.
In the meantime, no measures have been applied for months in relation to American legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide if they change their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim for its territory and has granted it entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign questions whether there will be at least 50 per cent required participation to make the referendum valid.
The question set out in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that was created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country today, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the realm of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have indicated that it will take the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, where 66% of registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjoise Tanevski to the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way for accession to the Union of Europe and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads high, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will be accompanied by investments more than necessary in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour of it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% declared that they would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first time hard for the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after he's reconnecting the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 in the disputed party at Etihad Stadium, Manchester last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal at minute 65 in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine leader received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left by speed between three Brighton defenses, tearing out what he was walking through the playing field with.
Then Agurero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He regattaed a defense before he passed a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English foreman returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, which with the right leg beat Brighton's porter, Mathew Ryan, with a jump that crashed on the inside of the network on the right side.
"Agüero has trouble on his feet," Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told journalists.
"We decided I'd play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky you scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came to the 29th minute.
On that move, Agurero received the ball deep into Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful pass into space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before he passed it to Sterling on the long pole.
Sky Blues leader finished the ball inside the network before he left the bottom line.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in part of the Champions League group phase at 18:55, at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off struggle, there weren't many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out on the launch mount on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a wildcard with 5 to 2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to get their first division title.
"Even if we don't play anything, we can at least go out and get to know the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably fight every point at the highest level, like no one did this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer throw away if this situation happens.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual rest day.
The Right Launcher in Washington has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strike eliminations in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump is a rally in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the environment of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, big ones. I don't introduce myself, but actually I do. That's why I'm fighting everywhere for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see their meanness, their ill intent.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he rebuffed, and called the Democrats "enraged, petty, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, who provoked a strong public shout.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When my local party Momentum activists voted to censure me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My colleague, Mr. John Ryan, received a similar treatment because he strongly protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for discriminating with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues with regard to which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
At the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long forgotten the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to turn 180° and take positions that I would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, central policies are denounced, and I'm told that it shouldn't be the Labour Party.
And that's not just about me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't get around.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with each motion of "untrustful" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is tightening up more.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice and I've been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and "it's going to be okay."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local advisor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will damage homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, actually, the message I want to convey is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or no political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Some Ayr beaten lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant game of Tennant's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of the ten, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed because of their defensive superiority and the fact that they were better able to take advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still stuck, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations for the Ayrs have taken better advantage of opportunities than we have.”
Grant Anderson's essay at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, stood in front of the Ayrs, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, given to the party by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot recorded an unconverted essay.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a sanction and, just in half, noted and turned an essay to put the score 17-5 in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted to Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Later, the party interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which retreated into bed, and in the retaliation the Ayrs re-enlarged the distance with a staff test McDowall converted by Climate.
Next, Captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted test of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a placard in Climo without a pilot, since the sanctioning alignment, MacPherson noted a counter-assay behind the penetrating spring of the Ayrs.
climo marked, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a joint of David Armstrong and passed the ball on the third line to Gregor Henry to record the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector.
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hotel sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in the BBC's popular series, writing and co-protagonizing with Greg Hemphil, his comic partner for a long time.
The two announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on it, although a source of the newspaper The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "floating restoration sector" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without the coast, hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered with army in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a marine blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are embedded in the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering him is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coastline in conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulses, a spirit of unity and serenity, and it is not necessary to say, she expects with a positive stance the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the next year's reelection, also has many hopes placed on Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it does, things would not change much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The resolution of the TIJ, which takes place only six months after the final allegations were submitted, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a fall back in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has been interested in any gesture of goodwill by Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally fast.
Next Monday Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancy, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation won't eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a chimera who thinks that US sanctions and objections to a declaration that put an end to the Korean War could never get North Korea to kneel.
Washington is suspicious of accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements before.
Both Kim and the president. American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the question of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only means to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of big hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the gateway a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram has been dragged by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated kiss hat, adorned with a broad, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were decorated belts, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafocal masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a frozen cone.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large-sized hats climb the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat, with two-foot wide, which everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the gateway: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in a bathtub that wore it.
The dark orange bag, decorated with raffia locks and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection The SS19 Riviera of Jacquemus on Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags in the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential to World Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a career of academic excellence that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working hard to provide a top level service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a matter of very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language you understand, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages received the A superior grade.
The data, compiled from 74 CIS member schools, reflected that 72% of the students obtained a higher A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that the independent schools of Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an election subject, remain in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that the reasons why entrepreneurs gave them the burden of covering their vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like that.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a poll conducted in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
That's why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools as to the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on the most traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important to the United Kingdom for the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest is, he'll always be able to choose among a number of languages in the independent schools, who have teaching staff specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global trading environment of today's era, languages cannot be denied to continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
We have to do this.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent School Council
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers' official site.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six pre-time game of the Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-time matches at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Metting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump scheduled matches for the next week, including visits to friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for your candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are issued in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video transmission via YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing begun this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the allegations of sexual abuse that he is facing, while the Senate's advance confirmation vote remains pending until a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this rallying wave is to help republicans present at the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
So the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at "strengthening volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, while we are heading for a stormy campaign season,” said a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, programmed at Wesbank Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the media coverage of Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows its ambition to keep the hopes of individual Sunday parties alive
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon ants were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendant of dynamic is an invented sports concept, where players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive run," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is setting an example.
The goutural shouts of celebration rose intensely as he continued his turn and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar scream, of the kind that indicates that he believes that the American team is not yet outside the competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bring four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday mornings and Friday afternoons, and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow into and from public bullying, it reaffirms that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close up a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at once in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's furballs, who married Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are very fascinating to see because of the interactions between matings, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this ant session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing Saturday's furballs and ants with a victory of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave their record, so far, four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, headed by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that wasn't right in the morning fourballs and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the ants and won two games, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at the 12 individual Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair that wins four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After slaving Woods and Patrick Reed in the furballs, they staged a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sparks, but lost 19 out of 29 games in furballs and ants, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourballs, remarried with Henrik Stenson in the ants and fell for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn't have everything in its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times tournament champions, and Justin Thomas set up a point of reference for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the forballs and later won once again Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 in the ants, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team had returned a four-point difference to individual parties, although Furyk's team, the title defender, only needs to draw to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming next Sunday is out of range.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm "in no way" if no signs of confidence are appreciated
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any US-consonant response,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri resumed known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-by-phase" denuclearization approach that North Korea would be rewarding as it took steps gradually, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral full-scale denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington must also resist the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization should take place first and increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive way, in addition to opposing the "declaration of the end of war", Ri pointed out.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to the plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted in the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this situation of strain.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missile territory was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim from "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that there is still a lot to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time limit for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Thursday to the UN Security Council that “the application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and final denuclearisation”.
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying they had made advances, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making “demands own from a gangster”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures”.
He said Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing culture, to study all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world’s number one university are often dismissed from the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Son Medicine Professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, dolls and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects the performance of sports to lack sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
To make sure to enjoy a good quality sleep for enough time should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, added, even to avoid getting weight, since deprivation of sleep puts the brain in inhalation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and Physics Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to conduct a similar curriculum before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends with the men of Gerrard
Dolly Menga's goal is to condemn Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home, which is another hit outside.
The set of Ibox sought to add his first home victory from the triumph of February 4th to 1st in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team to drift, at 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the marker.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third position, behind the hibernian in contrast to goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, since the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently jumped from the grade.
Gerrard made eight changes to the alignment that the Ayrs swept into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11 headline that pulled a point against the Hearts last week.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder shot misdirected and wasted the big occasion.
A relentless launch of Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow made only one shot diverted to the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but ref Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only drove two shots to bring the first part, but the first porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head hit and the sweet foreman Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi on minute 34 could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with Jacobs's work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted at the pause when he changed Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The change had an impact almost immediately, as the extreme went through Morelos, even though imponent Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have given way to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Litthgow made a detoured jump from the corner.
Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton still called for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but once again Thomson made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave way to the device we know as "Geiger counter."
Geiger, who is a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What day is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "Sure it's crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize is malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells and altering them in the lab
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then inject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that had been suffering for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells, altering them in the lab to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we've obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" to these cells such as treating cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was stranded in a pro-Trump slide with a MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was called to the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic act that congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be presented for the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody by Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Judicial Committee for complaints of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it didn't show up, comedian Chris Rock posted West's disapproval on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that he was not well treated between backstagers because of the hat he wore.
"They threatened me in the backyard.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would put on Superman's coat so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to advance?
Try to love."
His comments provoked public screaming at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed ashamed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who told the publication: "The entire study was completely silent."
West became the last-time substitute for Ariana Grande, the former one of whom, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience puzzled by the interpretation of Perrier's song and Love it, disguised as a bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Gracies to stand out between the crowd."
But the presentationer of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "existing who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the former known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Her rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music was renamed for a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution of attempted murder for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the murder of a man on Friday's east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The D.A. will review the charges.
The star of the throne game, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of the Jon Snow swordsman in the series of violent medieval fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male hero stereotype, claiming that these papers make it clear that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of the Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted that it is strong determination to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can be part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity due to its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they should have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there's definitely something wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's full of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will play a replay of Sam Shepard's True West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting her partner Rose is the best thing she's ever given her Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series winning an Emmy.
In June 2018, the couple entered into a marriage contract at the family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 reported 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV for this cause has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health officers' statements at a Yunnan province conference.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Considering the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual intercourse will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered Senate data from the Republican Party and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands pushed them into criticism and right-wing websites.
"Lives, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse complaints against the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
"This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which they have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this filtration of information.
This groundless complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
You don't have to be challenged.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
You must keep calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presenting himself to overthrow Waters in the parliamentary elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure the offenders are revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally held responsible for all the actions that have been carried out and that they have harmed each and every member of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of Johnny English's free-of-act parody comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satire about how despicable we are is going to be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent eyeset and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
It is obviously the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare liquated glamorous claims, has some Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch by this guy who gives a single note to the topic of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on Atkinson’s mysterious international traveler representing the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller sheets were retreading him in the helmet.
He sees the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems to be quite low and strangely superfluous, especially because film brands "serious" like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be destined for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as Mr. Bean's dumb gags that represent Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this engraved character of Teresa-May, but the script doesn't get any further.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that as every active spy gets in danger, he'll have to get some retirement.
And that includes the misdemeanour Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but teaching out-of-office classes about how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his dry sufferer Bough, a role that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little underprivileged.
So Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly at Her Majesty's secret service come into action again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the technological charismatic billionaire that claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ludicrous odyssey: dressing waiters, burning a French fast-eating restaurant, spreading chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
All the parades have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all looks like a child program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English's other films, it wasn't helpful to think if the film industry had given Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day workweek and cover five of them.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business leaders to spend their savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by giving them a day's party.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they'll get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the workers.
The four-day shift to one week's work is supported by trade union union confederation Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits the party's perspective on balancing the economy in favour of the worker and in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner today.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also imply that water companies shareholders may not recover the entire investment, as the Labour Government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in companies' joint ventures and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who hope to bottle up annual dividends for up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" whether the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI could make them change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment for the Supreme Court at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean it," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined, and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive charge," he said.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people he appoints will be able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, which carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless someone wanted to pay a VIP entry), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just a case more than we call "clictivism" (a staff who thinks it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, who have helped achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37,000 million dollars, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from their shares, of which at least $10,000 million has already been repaid or raised.
The group estimates that currently protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the foundation of The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which commits to "helping children grow up as much as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of a page of history," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long, hard way. Sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights defense movements and the previous apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will be performing at the New York New York's annual event, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, "if necessary" turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, have revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervention in Syria, primarily where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees to the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"Economic choice in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while he indicated that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project cost $11,000 million and will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak declared after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, the IDF, has called on the US to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" her candidacy for the presidency after the elections of the legislature.
At a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to hold high office," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms at Trump and his High Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "of course it takes an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the Senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would disclose his decision officially on January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin's hit at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after listing September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families that suffer from TEPT branches and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he told the public at a rally by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little different, they come back stiff, they ask again whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and arms holding under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18 state representatives and the district presented a friend curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented on August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She was assaulted by her partner "and the children of the violent gang," but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which generates a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, since it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their 11th June announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never tried to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her feverish son in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their homes destroyed to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who have fractured their shoulders, are out of Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the severe shaking that is repeated.
Her tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," explained Haris to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "propaganda ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed on Wednesday at the China Daily payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections on November 6, U.S.A., an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in U.S. elections marked what US officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to introduce ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in a growing trade war that has seen oranges grow in mutual imports.
China's vindictive tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads on our free press."
"By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of free speech and free press to include a payment announcement in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the kiosk that's down here in Beijing, you'll find few conflicting voices and you won't see any real reflection of the disparate views Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans belong to women voters before the Kavanaugh disaster elections, warn analysts
As many of the major Republicans support and defend the candidate at the High Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces various sexual assault applications, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming elections of the legislature.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have already officially shown that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse in The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s final hour pressure to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior counsellor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November is coming) as they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby as Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Ms. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst on the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; that's true.
But they could have been more, especially among voters of women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault claims to the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a negative response if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board's vote or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits at the defendant's bank, but also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they treated it," pointed out Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps to choose Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the scale that is slowly going towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the polls believe in ford's testimony in a certain way or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in evidence or possibly Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing in Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the applications filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez complained that the Supreme Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is excluded from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personally empowered through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates appropriate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new integrated website on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Cross Victory of the I GM
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in their hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial tombstone at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was present exactly 100 years after his grandfather's custodian prowess.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran toward the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" made the row advance before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prosa that could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is shown by support that will be received by many people.
The MMA fans who stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying awake all night to see Bellator 206 and refusing to see the most important event.
San José's sign contained 13 fights, including six of the main card, and they had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the fight, United Kingdom spectators were amazed when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted with the way they had spent the night waking up to see the struggle.
A Twitter tracker described the shift for cartoons as "a kind of puking joke."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is inadequate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the piggy, yes."
The president of Bellator's company, Scott Coker, said they'd be working on programming to include United Kingdom spectators in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six o'clock a Sunday morning and we can't solve it till Sunday at our own time, Monday at their own time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages going and coming, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it back to the followers, but it ended.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he has grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio 4 program presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father was still important to winning the Olympics.
The usual presentationer of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on the first program in Laverne, said he felt "less than" the others because "he wasn't socially acceptable like children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
Twice the winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without branches and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The World Tricamp explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
He says that when you pass so when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone as old as he has experienced similar heights and similar lows.
The couple were parents in a kid's June named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me about it last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, her father did not accept the idea that she would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had already come in for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you, "Father, you won't be there to occupy the first row," she said.
"While he was holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally agreed that it wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamt my whole life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparations for the Olympics and which he still put on his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is released to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson got into Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become a unhappy tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to hit a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has often been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between being an entertainer and working in his field game, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult track, where the long rough usually punishes the deflected blows.
And if his own path is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who joined the Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four down points at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood perfectly his role for that day, made me a slap on my back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"You have a lot of self-confidence.
It's a Hall of Fame and it's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I figured more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race at Ryder Cup that hasn't matched its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought in the team intangibles.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun messing with him this week, which has been fun seeing.
It's a lot more than his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that starting with considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team headed by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won the win for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but shortly," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team victory for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that have not finished yet.
Tomorrow you have to go to every machine.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points go up on the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we need to keep the focus to do so.
I said, focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Enthralled with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never rush with it.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than on team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the summits of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with good foot, as seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We have prepared alignment depending on the circumstances and the best way to try magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rebound against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it would not, at least, do so until the next year after faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The finalization of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-building problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Army in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against theft, such as a small radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new frigates up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that advance ships, which were expected to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete as they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Missa Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why it has been returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable when used on combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the old Bremen frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Army to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-toner Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached a surprising 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate the weakening of Germany's maritime military power.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Army "is staying without ships that can be used."
The officer said the situation worsened over time because old ships were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Army.
National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a highland farm in Scotland seeks to find out how the bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
Findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, in addition to northern ears and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key ownership locations to monitor the activities of the bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Conservation Advisor of the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are more important to batpenates and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has been significantly reduced in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting are also at risk, just like the paper that kills and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as the attacks on domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a catch.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the batpenates very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the Three Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habit.
But we still don't know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
He noted the importance of checking whether there are bats before performing property maintenance tasks, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single motherhood nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Rats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Foundation for the Conservation of Rats, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare an appeal against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has claimed that people "will make themselves famous" by his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The head of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Allegedly, he paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to the information published by Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a 33-year-old video of Instagram Live addressing his 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five times winner of the Golden Pilot in the camera.
"They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "unacceptable information on private life suspicions," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage due to an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed at the County Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayora claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%."
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were consenting.
Majorga also said she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an agreement outside the courts because she had "the fear of reprisals" and she was concerned "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, since she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for King Madrid coming from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he recorded for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret it," if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "disquieting" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the event of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Director of Management in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other United Kingdom car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit with no agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a fair-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK suppliers and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately balanced to avoid these border controls."
We want to get the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"Tyota tests, not only, but also other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota couldn't confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that the added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union on the plant, said that members start to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "posted for a week" while continuing the fight about the appointee at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, Russian links and Trump aid and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy Attorney General and puts Mueller's independence at risk, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House in rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I'd rather not" fire Rosenstein, but he postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation at the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied the following: "There is still no date set, it could be this week, although it may take another week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may object: Sanders has not had any briefings about the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions wasn't because he didn't like the TV reporters' shop, though he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
He then insinuated that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders said that the briefing sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do so often, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with dignitaries on an official visit.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at some times, strange in front of the assembled journalists.
The Health Secretary writes to EU employees of the Scottish National Health Service following fears for Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the coming out of the EU's United Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be geared towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting the patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers rebound has undergone an emergency operation after a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, from Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before half.
"He came to the band line and collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting him in a bunk bed and taking him away to get more evidence.
An officer from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris of WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been out of surgery at the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after fixing it from Illinois.
I had completed five plaques on Saturday before I left the party, which make a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The foundation expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher yields.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be devoted to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
The base expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
13% of London's new construction properties are estimated to be non-British residents, increasing prices and making it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many bountiful areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the installments on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rental and termination of "no blame-free" denunciations.
He also wants to give the concierge more power to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be right that it's as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom as it is for businesses with them abroad to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home is too far away and the indignity of homeless people makes everything even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently holds the third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coachship include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's coach claims that he does not feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only think I've succeeded here if I can get the club back."
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he recalled about taking the charge at the Halloa.
"I always thought training was what was best given to me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out of it reasonably and enjoyed quite good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard of myself since I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at Britain's hard-hit bars, but it has added more pressure to the chains of restaurants.
Bars and bar chains have gained an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has been reduced by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA's financial advice, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous sunny hours and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while the consumption at restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
At the bars and taverns we have consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at leisure and RSM hotel, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the foreign market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% per year would be especially harmful, rather than the continuing pressure for costs.
This long and warm summer couldn't have arrived at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide this much-needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the momentum in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the established reference point of the sector.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to poll data
A poll of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase on "false Insta" pages.
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
News has raised fears about publishing sexual content.
About 20% of the students say they have a clean "principal" account that shows their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "violate me."
The investigation, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Private School Steering Committee (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of teenagers between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half has admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's boss, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "sight of athletes" in the Scottish Federation of Athletics directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics directive at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is Scotland's lead and field athlete with more medals and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has respect for Scotland's athletic community, the United Kingdom and all over the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm eager to act as an athlete's voice and I hope to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won the gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic bears and currently usual BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's agility practice!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
An ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinions on the Internet
A trash company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with scrambled cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent rolllet that can be brought from the world," the consumer technology company Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a music video joke to show the freedom that gives the new rolllet to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of rags and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm dying to myself, but you won't see any tails" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not
The tour continues: "Bombs, bombs, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, working girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mix of reactions from those who saw it, many of whom claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie Tirallet is hidden discreetly in a lactation bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a handgun for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an off-site advertisement."
Other people defended the advertisement; one woman admitted to finding that the song was "funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the bowl made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another person commented the following: "It's a funny announcement for mothers who bomb with handcuffs (usually at their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the tirallet discreetly placed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when using the bowl.
However, the Elvie Tirallet is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a lactating bra, which gives women more freedom to move, hold babies and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first-born partner and developer, said: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a rollet is used and the challenges it is supposed to do, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic manner, the incredible sense of freedom that the new rolllet offers.
It's not the first time Elvie is on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrants, quietly moved to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of emigrants detained has increased even though monthly entries across the border have practically remained stable, partly because the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be cared for.
Traditionally, most godfathers were paperless immigrants, who were afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to take a child.
Risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential fathers and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs control officer, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who have received or live in the home of a person who has received are illegal in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month after being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by video conference, rather than by face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
Everyone who is not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are being held in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports that have revealed the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs that indicate a child is suffering are overlooked.
They've added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say good-bye to friends can cause a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem has insisted that the "war of terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacement.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the whole Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-affected country.
On the subject of refugees, Mualem has declared that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational grounds" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem has noted that the agreement has "clear terminals" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated."
Staff of Mistura, sent by the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and opposition to begin to profile a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, which should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win for the Second Time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to wait, the scandals and the process of dismissal ended with their presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
There are no signs of fatigue in the viewers at the moment.
Since 2014, the number of high-time audiences has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million high-time viewers from the 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show," from the MSNBC, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have been told that they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, the executive producer of the "Designed Survivor" ABC series, about a Cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"I answered that because I made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families could meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar fur jacket ("a piece of thick clothes like his pride", headlined Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it look like it's part of a reality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and the screenplays of Trump's program (to fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose an episode to stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked looking at the MSNBC while I was recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the Supreme Court's future hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

External money floods the races of parliamentary elections in the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realisation of the congressional districts that two current members have to compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who got the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb confronts another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrafted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed on January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans.
The competition for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the major financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named after an adjusted victory in a highly followed special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congress district.
The Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners fired the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauru, spokesperson for the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which received US $140 million in 2017 aid, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvement.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would be detrimental to the Central American country and high numbers of deaths due to murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior management officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended with any likelihood of sanctions for the Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for the middle of October, as a sign of the importance of the administration, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to their office in Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three officers described, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss internal discussions from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to take place could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there are numerous evidences in public records.
As you know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
They're a lot of circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, or any of his European homonyms, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both shores of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted it and supported Czechoslovacs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over inflexion points like this and it accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of turning points today.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been with water on his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for the charge.
Rosenstein claims that the information in the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, in particular, are we going to vote in the middle of a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on that table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers received the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in the Vila-Real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Group of G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented half-fielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season up to 2-2 against the Royal Village, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Real Town is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else in the end, but in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first part, but we were better than they were at the second part.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can keep the three points, but it's going to be a hard game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll do everything, but we'll get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give everything, leave the season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep for fear of savings for retirement
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to the family about it.
Approximately half of the polls at national level say they've talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the polls say he talked to the children about it.
"People want some family members to take care of them, but they don't dare think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children about how you can prepare your family to do that.
Work with your counselor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation. It may also help you to determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care can include a long-term long-term insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses or own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step to legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical attention and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary power for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your elder family has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also with which doctors will be treated," said Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are being cut, relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Dojaga Regency, an area in the north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Dojaka, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Heavens, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis occurred.
Dojaka is a regency that extends over 300 km from the coast northwest of the island of Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Célebes, especially in the coastal region of Donjaka.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but mainly in Morrowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Dojaka have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dojaka.
In 1996, there was also a tsunami in western Donjaka that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Firebelt and there are often earthquakes.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace in northern Sumatra provoked a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude rocked a pop zone in the city of
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude rocked one of the islands of Mentawai on the Sumatran coast, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 metres [10 m] that claimed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya’s regiment in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: There were a series of major earthquakes on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with assault charges.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled her phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su interim detention centre, where he is held with a non-secure obligation of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, safely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A gaps, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B failure, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a drunken weapon in relation to the incident.
His partner said he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia — hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian Island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake took place just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.

Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, at Lower Manhattan and run on travelers and cyclists during his journey in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the warning of intent to apply for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could result in a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal juror attacked Saipov with a 22-provoked indictment that included eight charges of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "unhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the warning of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South District of New York brought a death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted by conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the statement of indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He's been found not guilty of the 22 missing charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to call for the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilt statement and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Parliament member of the Conservative Party asserts that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
The previous UKIP leader said politicians have to "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the Members of the Theresa May parliament himself suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Preservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when Conservatives in favour of the union have filed themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Czech compromise plan between the attacks of the Brexit supporters, the Union's supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative answers and pressure Euroseptics and the Conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally from Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out now,' she said.
Parliamentary member Wellingborough added, "I will defend Brexit, but we have to disengage Chequers."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is completely false."
Brexit Conservative partisan Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to the reporters: "I only tell you, Prime Minister, to hear people."
"The Czechers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win a few elections.
Give up Chequers' engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the rally politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a question of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't allow them."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We're mobilizing the popular troops of this country that won us victory with Brexit and we won't rest until we become an independent, autonomous, and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the union supporters marched for Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small number of activists shook flags over the Conservatives against Brexit after the release of the group this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered from a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Agreement plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of being a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll look into the possibility of being a presidential candidate after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, usual critic of President Donald Trump, presented for his re-election in November against the state representative of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was the centre of speculation about the possibility of raising Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took over his office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it's time that "women go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for killing Sims, LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the death of LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the E.T. press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and called for collaboration to identify the man of the film.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and died near the campus of Southern University in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims received a shot at the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the world's title after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxing before and left Hamilton running in traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a certain wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the inside free at the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time was in the seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in a good position, keeping his wheels on save time, advancing to Kimi Raikkonen and moving to fourth position.
Finally he entered the boxers at round number 44, but he could not increase the pace at the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a great job of having one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communiqués and the leaks and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?" "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Kavanaugh's statements from Ford in July and filtered in September, but Feinstein denied the filtration from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," explained Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept him confidential, just as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the High Court candidate, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to have power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Friday at Elite against the Belfast Giants, since they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-point advantage thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee. Afterwards, two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants at the first break when he achieved the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and again Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at a minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game Friday.
An airplane driver dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
A plane controller in Indonesia has become a hero after he dies to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and unleashed a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area, and there's a lot of people trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Générale refused to leave his place at the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Six Al Jufri Airport airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik 6321, who was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirrait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"That's broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donjaka, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that could not be accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and failures.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the small businesses have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clocks to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the accident in the pond
The airline operating a flight that's going to crash into a Pacific pond in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although previously said the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane tied to the pond because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the plane's emergency exits, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and that he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors working close to it to improve a dock also helped rescue with an inflatable boat to transport affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in airline accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst makes up a night's chronology that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concludes the case on Saturday in the review of a man's trial accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movement, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Telephone records indicated that I had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and Chambers contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury over the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills your music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed of Bristol ensures that hip-hop has turned away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and get back to fashion the conscious hip-hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Maid requires a couple to say good-bye after a "racist" message
A New York nurse complained to a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at the fact that Giselle Maurice, the new nurse, was black when she got to work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR ANOTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After she realized her pifia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had fired, who was afro-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and was then sent home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple compensation for dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month resident job for which they had hired her, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they were racist, claiming Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand to an "extortion," said his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put herself in someone's place that liga for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small peacock bone, was optimistic about the rejection of the book, and he also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agreolç", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and shows that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's none of your business.
I think he thought so was the success of Paddington.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, I used to acknowledge Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
When they landed, they brought their daughter quickly to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nothing would often call to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect to overcome it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs he had been given to keep his body beating up were consuming and coming out of his system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, since I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep the right shape."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had a bald head and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much."
Women in mourning hang cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis living in Lydney said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "for people know that there are people you can turn to, that you can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched bottom on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death meant a great trauma to them, but they had to work on it: "Open a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread while the FBI starts an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the earlier death point of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man who wants him elected to arrive at the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to clear the ranks and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "caust" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Unity Ministry said that 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices for human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, most Northern deserters are offered South Korean nationality.
Sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees, and often repatriates by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on stopped negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that he's not fit to work at the High Court.
The minority leader of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate at the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament is incapable of working at the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her it's a "histeric," Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh's before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee and said that the charges against him were "a gruesome and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not work at the High Court, as he showed his prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed some reluctance when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it's confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only able to be in the High Court, but not in the court where you are now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh is serving as a judge at the Columbia District Circuit Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he did not question whether he would annul certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's no time for a hysterical person to enter the court and expect it to seem wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatric: months and years of abundant anger and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon.
He went on... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it kept going.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a masculine majority, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a cold directive that had always frightened me a little) who took me from the cliff and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said to me as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since he was late for the campaign, he was late for the fundraiser, so he promised that he would not enter the race if he did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you to the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and guiding voters, rather than to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he ran out of words.
"You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about the press reaction.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What are they going to put in my grave?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing · Global Voices
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were shocking and, although it does not seem that the war should be over soon, a distance countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new oranges affecting products worth $200 billion, these oranges are taxing half of all the goods that have arrived in the United States since China.
Beijing has repeatedly counterattacked in the same way and recently has raised the oranges from five to ten percent to 60 billion USD of American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States, and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world will move forward in the near future.
Getting Washington back means giving in to some demands, but bowing publicly in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" for refugees to return, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the streets is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also about six million people on earth who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 in defeating the American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the shot out into the water in the hole by 316, which gave victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone on all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was removed with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't mean to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the glass back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help," commented an excited Garcia after European victory.
He highlights his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated the legend of the American Gulf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four games he had in France and now has a career record at the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought all weekend to search the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there has been a time when we have pressed the European election.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love those 12 players, and I'm proud to have been your captain.
There's to take off his hat.
We've been defeated."
