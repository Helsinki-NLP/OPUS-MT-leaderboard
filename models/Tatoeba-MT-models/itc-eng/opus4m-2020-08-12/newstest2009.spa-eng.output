The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ's shares reached about half the value they have in a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday's trade, immediately reacted to the fall of Monday when it descended about 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the Secretary of the financial sector.
Loss of shares in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it reduced its losses by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows Chinese stock movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The shares of the Sidney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary dropped to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the US are unsafe and this affects the financial market around the world," said the head of the Hong Kong Money Office, Joseph Yam.
While Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make the falls feel in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan of aid to the financial system to which $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American shares lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the actions picked up the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retires: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
The American legislators caused a gap in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, he's not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
After that, however, the "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms which will also be achieved in practice by market aid.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolve our dissenting views regarding the way in which the package of measures for market stabilization should take" said Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the plan agreement, which will work and will also have to be effective on the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis expressly affects the market of rapidly falling shares.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything possible to ensure that Congress finally approves an agreement this Sunday.
With this they want to reassure investors' businesses to the Asian finance market as these are the ones that are in the first time slot and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear as to when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, and not even if they will not be stagnated at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the programme does not fulfill its role, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision, but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained to earn financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying off their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the advance of Saturday and that he appreciates "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a closure that alleviates the planned financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called armoured contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also helps homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new payments of mortgages it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of the debt payments over time and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
" Much more important is that, by this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give their visa as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at the moment, the most important," said Marek.
Armed Hand Fight: MP3 Player vs. Mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
Still there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on how you use it and on the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern record player to listen to in it the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP disks are no longer coming out, and in terms of their quality there is no single objective reason to keep buying them.
If vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues are swallowed up in their shelves, you are probably dreaming about at least this type of record player.
This is the same with the music on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each one.
The election is wide.
Also decides the battery duration
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobiles.
No current apparatus is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions like calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, recording both, has a better or worse camera and can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle since no fridge can make a grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions you use on your mobile before the screen indicator will be illuminated by asking you to be reloaded.
And music reproduction is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few are the mobiles who can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of which are much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If besides this, above, they constantly call themselves to get even, for more safety, a shipper for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some readable units without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, gender or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment interest in the accumulator resistance, memory capacity, quality and sound output and, of course, in the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then you are enough with any mobile that reproduces.
What almost really gets any mobile.
It should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and practically all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it, the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and your iPod).
The best mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply via the mobile internet visit the relevant operator pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a weight argument to acquire a music cell phone.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the themes of fleet success of the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, this way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) is supposed to dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a headphone or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile, even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - really manages any person.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous common cassettes or also to the record player are evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile and, therefore, gigantic data loss account.
Which apparatus to decide
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach 2,000 crowns.
Be careful, however.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a maximum capacity card of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (maximum 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If one of the most demanding music lovers is considered to be the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the 4,000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most cited brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna take long to get there.
That Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) who warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulating roaming rates, it is likely that a paradoxical situation will be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already stated that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operators.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant price decrease to which classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator was able to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, it is enough for them with many fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled at low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that however, often contradicts the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half of the cost with respect to competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland can also be a good blow to bet for a trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically addressed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he's the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether it seems as if the concept of Poland could catch up with us in our country.
This is why Vodafone's spokesperson, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there are any virtual operators in the Czech Republic, that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," said in telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly it ensured that current mobile telephony operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows the group GTS Novera that I would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phones.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have been able to make progress at the meetings," said the spokesperson for the group, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At present we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date no one has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobile.cz, Vladimil Sršeň, spokesperson for Telephone O2.
Other operators are concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "We have not yet registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And add: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table a specific contract that could be studied in such a short horizon"
Vodafone directs its attention rather to meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
Precisely we consider it to be the biggest contribution from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with operators and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull out of the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure to the ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile society.
This is attested to by the public information available on the websites of ČTÚ.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "Also, the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market has not long been open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that another player's entry into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his major services requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," added our question Kristian Chalupa, from the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements did not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers, it is more than a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators work normally we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to the price drop of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market media and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
The truly shocking thing in all this case lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is an accident is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no sign of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunication regulators," added Chalupa's response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously a relevant market analysis developed by ČTU that telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile telephony operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must be necessarily dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should be a warning that three mobile operators are going up in a similar manner.
Current complaints from stakeholders (induced by the so-called GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators they are shocked with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTU is a rather common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We've met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately a new amendment to the telecommunications law was introduced recently for the extension of the competition of ČTU in the field of commercial tenders that had not been put into effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known by UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, it is unconsciously still working as well as a pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech mobile telephone networks there are a few already.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen people get the list of prices of these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the company in charge of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will receive after special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be considered infringements in terms of contract terms that could be translated at the end of collaboration with the given society," he answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three companies mentioned above, they may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are only used by such a despicable percentage of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not in your name so you cannot have it as a normal customer of operators."
Precisely this is what should seem to the least strange ČTU.
In addition, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this history and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market resulted in a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators tried to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they made the first virtual operator appear and others began to emerge with it.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body goes through this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience, we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this information between backstages is correct and the virtual operator actually arrives at these lands, then the Czech market of mobile telephony is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators allows any virtual mobile telephony operator to enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Choir and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for this.
The authors of the hymn arrangements are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek views this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before it intentionally chose for the Singing solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both of them and then, also, with the Choir that were fixed in the dictionary so that the text would be well understood, so that it would have consonance," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home rang for the first time in 1834 in the State Theatre tables in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was naturally made part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by nearly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and load it simultaneously on their chip card at the infocentres and posts of the transport company at the Metro stations, Museum, Mŏstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can already be purchased on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, up to the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket sales at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a regular ticket out.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged to you in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window available to passengers with prepared staff who assists stakeholders with the purchase on the internet and also with the reloading of the bonus purchased on their card," said the project's spokesperson, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the automatic expensive machines found in some subway halls.
How are these expensive machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and travelers will probably have already fixed themselves in them at the stations of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only on it.
Electronic bonuses from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the roundabout trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"On trains dedicated to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus", explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The circumvalition buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's locker.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the driver's card but also to accompany the driver with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bond.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who don't travel on the circumvaliation buses and don't remember when the bonus's validity is finished can go to the expensive machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information on the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudets in 1945 called for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Germans of the Sudets addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
The results are from the letters stored in a particular archive and are now stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Terra Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - to Czechoslovakia again.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as deliverers" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry Šumava's destiny in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the Czechoslovakia union with the southeastern Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American President who assumes for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants it gives us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all it collaborates with the victory of the allies," the letter says.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president allegedly doubted about this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or to live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, can sound a little childish, according to some experts, very carefully paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to understand at least that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
This was in the war, like German of Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British arrested him and placed him in the camp of Holstein prisoners tens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would do them good," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Goods Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think--you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could be characterized by the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday.
The Minister's office, Aleš ★ebíček promises to deter drivers from conducting dangerous behaviour on the wheel.
The campaign of 150 million will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
I would have to deter the driver from speeding up and from alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that the belts are attached before they start.
He wants to reach awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embuse emotions.
And for this we are told by the "blood" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think--you pay!
The word "Don't Think" is written with large letters on the license plate.
And in a blood tank is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a moment of sneezing can come to pay with his own life.
The announcements are going to "fear" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whipping for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and whip system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a light is passed in red and so saves time.
The whip is a threat to a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says hospital transportation psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay any more attention to it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas for peace
The president of Israel's interim government, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the restoration of practically all the land occupied in 1967, i.e., the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all the lands (occupied) if not all of them," Olmert said to the daily.
"I'm sure we'll stay with a few percent of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to give them a percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, this would also be included in Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," pointed Olmert in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place" located within the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also took the view that the withdrawal of Israel from the Highs of the Golan was an inherent condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to do to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hizbulah (the Chita Movement), they must get rid of the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (the Chita Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the prime minister.
Questions After the Accident: Are the Zafats illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long distance bus
Regarding the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, we wonder if the azafatas and passengers can move along the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the azafata is opposed to the road transit law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which last week the twenty-two-year-old saffron died, was evidently caused by the truck driver only when the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the precise moment when the towel distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the paper is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to stand, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the passenger movement is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the way if they have a seat," said his position.
The ashtray doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the azafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less sharply, spokesperson Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law adequately addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to have walking sites.
That's it," he says.
The buses are divided between the urban areas, where there are places to stand and at maximum speed, interurban with sites to stand with a higher speed permit and those with long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's transport safety expert, Jaroslav Hořín, does not see any major problems with the movement of azaphate on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Not even here you have the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the azafata can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops the physical laws are obviously valid.
The same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the azafata must be resolved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says, and he also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter offering the azafat service.
He employs two hundred people in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, at the moment I feel like the azafata position is risky, then I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
I'd save even expenses," she says.
In the interest of security is the reason why Asiana lacks towels on her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have azafatas, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," said Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line that joined Naples, a young Pilsen saffron who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to prevent him, however, shocked the right side of the front.
Jančura denies that the two sites which are reserved for the rest of the azafata were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family, but it is also waiting for the financial expenses of the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of the azafata on the bus in which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the azafatas which significantly threatens the safety of passengers", ending spokesperson Hanzelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Board of Directors to its collaborators, there is no shortage of great words.
The merger of Dusseldorf Bank units with the DEKA bank can form 'a central capital market of the Spartassen financial group', as stated in the letter, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the `competence block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter into such a business.
Moreover, such a merger can be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text comes to be understood, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like the West LB used to be under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services which has recently made clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the side of Frankfurt, there is much talk about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, revealed that he saw no meaning in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or the West LB.
But the Board of Directors of DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to begin negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed to be so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, Hesse's government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhine-Palatinate regional bank started the dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the Helaba board, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of this it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
As the elections of the Bavarian parliament pass, the BayernLB's union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that does not necessarily result in good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will be missing partners to accomplish that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it emerged much better from the financial crisis that the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Spartassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided co-existence plans with the West LB.
In any case, there is only the North LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro- Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank's board of directors it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the bank as a whole.
As you can compare the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with DEKA, that's going to show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca is the third or fourth time.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Otopefest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, this night at 23:45 three buses leave, `the Munich direction, the beer feast', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly intended for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to its flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver slippers, belongs to him these buses.
For five years they've been coming to Okotfest, bearing in mind that there are only three excursions this year.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
spending the night there means just unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on their way on the highway with the "Brenner" address
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It goes to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the bus shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the car park next to Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses throughout Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Mark has his last speech on how to proceed.
First: put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "know-how.it".
Second: "When you open the doors of the campaign shop, that means walking!", he screams at Marco in the morning.
"Go!" Go and occupy the back places in the campaign store.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all of you with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, scattered across all space!"
One litre of beer, Marco's rust, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy already!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at 10:30 you have to get here!" Have you understood?
And now everyone goes to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, up to the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signals and even on a poster of the elections of a great People's Party of Bavaria.
It is desirable to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest which is known as "the weekend of Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of them all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hippo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück only stressed last week.
Well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate fund, which is listed in the DAX index, receives a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist turbulence on the market.
On Monday, a person who knew the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hippo Real Estate is going to use has to cast interest.
Money comes from private banks also from public law.
The cause of this is the loss of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state finance with the money it was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short period, which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the cash bank's capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of its own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued revenues of financial investment and net profits of financial transactions fell to zero, the debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-per-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-debt-deb.
Only thanks to the high and high income of reimbursements for the restructuring costs of the former Depfa Group and to the interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and organized businesses for the consortium's companies, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatisation in 1990 the former state finance at first was lost in speculations with industrial loans for the buildings, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
Since much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hippo Real Estate has to make depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated group's loss and gain account, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By the year 2007, they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial financial fund in the area of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans dropped essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year, the Royal Hypo Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa’s credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Hippo Real Estate, the bank covers with credit the need for group funding for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets which are now essentially not fit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the president of the Royal Estate Board of Directors, explained that the Royal Estate Group would not need monetary markets for foreseeable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Monitoring (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that we do not need funding in its full volume.
But the case cannot be ruled out otherwise.
I heard that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation can't at least reassure people concerned.
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, loan courses according to the position in the property register are clearly down.
They are mainly affected by the loans from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hippo and with reason the loans whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the Depfa banking crisis and acquisition that affected the Hippo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculations should be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can be based on early retirement amortization.
Or something is going to happen, which is not likely to be imagined by anyone - the financial crisis is going to be overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross news about partial stagnation, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the new account transportation of losses for next payment of benefit compensation payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Tachibana High School, the girls started laughing: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
Sola had to find the way, luckily I didn't miss it.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home in Baja Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had been asked to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who talks with a lot of taste in the audience, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, this is how I put myself on the pulpit and tried to say everything right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this point because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have sewn, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her about my Mangas.
That belongs to the vocabularies of survival of Japanese girls and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I slipped quickly into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the girl exchanged had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really robbed.
Everyone spoke at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese.
Then at recreation everyone drew their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - is something else than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu-mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what it's like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bandages are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bandage made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to her in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm so curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I am fascinated."
Finally for years I'd rather read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I began to study some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I was going to travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is a hard, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, acting like us, feel the same way?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else can prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown domain because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as the other animals: he makes himself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and the executive functions that lead behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the tongue, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even when consciousness would not depend on the tongue, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it should, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not let it be measured because it has the special hardware, nor let it be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consensual experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing happens to the neutral correlations of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex what distinguishes primates and especially man.
From a linguistic point of view, there are classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others with the help of ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the body feelings and brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like they're afraid, that might feel in two cases too: but how can they be controlled if rats and men behave in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger, a cockroach flees, then because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of behaviour does not yet prove the likeness of experience.
That is true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to try it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the area of neurology is expected here as it is measured by rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister said that preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's championship along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to be done."
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is done.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
Now we have to do jobs with great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA Platini President that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were sentenced due to manipulation down to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Confrontation of Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He's angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in the former pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors in Hollywood publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how often Meg tells the history of our relationship in another version," 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News."
Among other things it is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "to remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is newly married and recently is twins pope.
And so he ends with his statements pointing out: "No matter how my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's tickets.
According to one current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and overnight stays in hotels were again cheap - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express's travel services and financial services.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 out of 48 different cities in Europe rose by average to 6.9 percent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent comparing last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar course, which was the reason that "the interests of American tourists in travel decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travellers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of the plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5%, but the changes in prices for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is, on the one hand, the increase in the low economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes the traffic of aircraft between the United States and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him is not yet going out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
All that I meant exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal", Silba Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were again in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapist, he enjoys a great reputation as one of those who formed part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of nod.
Cornelius is brother to Martin Jol, Hamburg's main coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1.0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," Marcell Jansen said.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the alloy than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its forced players late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the greedy Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but the quipo still cannot shine with its successes.
"We need more than feeling and driving," demands Jol.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package dropped a certain period the Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important barometers in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At the moment the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a great Warren Buffet investor had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to purchase so-called "podride" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid by accident but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the state must receive the equity option receipts for financial associations that can be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state cash.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to decline
One billion aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hippo Real Estate is low and influences the Dax negatively.
Despite the saving of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
Loss of the speculative shares of the Hippo Real Estate and the Commercebank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the saving actions of the federal government and private banks, the action of Munich's real estate finance for a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and paid a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets worldwide have suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's 700 billion-dollar saving package is not sufficient to boost financial markets.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are leaking now threatens a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver, has caused disconcerting among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver in the trajectory of space probes while they get acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example, on Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: missiles do not behave for 100 percent as well as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
Instead, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now.
He was called anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what were left astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter which can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
She supposedly owns the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientific calculations, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister, after ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of bailouts.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
The Germans always fall back at the point of attention of kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are evidently released.
The same information includes state-owned Egyptian television, the Al-Arabija Arab television station and the Italian media.
After news of the release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your health status,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports state Egyptian television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was only about "receiving hostages" when suddenly this "surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue of six million euros from Germany; the money had to deliver the German wife to one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release women hostages after they have received the ransom.
Men had to be arrested until kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepmother abuse "leaded to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by their stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight charges of indecent assault.
The Royal Truro Court, through an investigative study, knew that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
During the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her eyes and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working on a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by her abuse twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking away his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she had not done so, the question would probably not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on his daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising future of success and happiness."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, abandoned two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed to the BBC before he was handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention of delinquency.
The BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguard of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over 80,000 pounds after the rescue/recovery of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect deposits of the 2.6 million bank savings.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it “humiliant” that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest due in the interim is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover £81 thousand to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Association Commercial of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to BSA, there is no evidence indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options are available to protect construction societies and their members against what could be a relevant price," added Mr. Cole.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of due interest, which may be almost twice as many.
Being the construction societies of mutual organizations and not having shareholders, its members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises five pence per litre
The people on the Jersey Strait will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and after the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the milk price had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Denial of bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption in your charge.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, supported militarily, grant her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not now clear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she could not obtain bail because she was already in treatment abroad on parole," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let's file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
His defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, took over power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polymyelitis vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said it happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9 per cent in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impeded competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Polio Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of participation in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom, opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the recruitment of US lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of management officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Several allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But later it was known that lawyers had not evaluated themselves worse than others, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the pursuit of Republicans, high profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other members of the Department of Justice did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissals, which "abdication" of his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the nominations for this year's prizes and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell from Meat Loaf remained in classifications for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, looks like a dusty alley more than an active road.
No signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
who wants to re-embowel Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-time neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the past block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee on Land Use for Land Use this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the Community district manager n.3.
"The city now owns very few spaces and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Committee on Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and observed that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of it.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, Bowery’s ones, Extra Place has left a trace in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who photographed it in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the east village’s burgering, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they are, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a king of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the history of the city about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a rather narrow and dead-end street, dark also by day and marked by doors of iron warehouse oxidized and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blowing along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that it could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
effectively calling on Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in the classroom, is effective in eradicating the distance in final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of students in the fourth year have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching students English is in the "total immersion."
English immersion means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who arrived from Mexico and who, if you go into the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's prediction of the response.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The shares of crude oil decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 the barrel in the morning negotiations in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning again because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors, once again on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was haunted by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, on the frenzy weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "do not seem to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, a reduction in demand for commodities, including oil, is expected.
"The prospects for global equity, the interest and exchange rate will become increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and forecasting to reduce oil and gas prices by 20 percent for 2009.
Second crazy room: team set record
After having spent, during the last eight seasons, more than anyone else in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things develop on the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without an annotation into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with parency under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles achieving a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for one afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of them when one cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He is a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated the Kurt Warner quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a running shot and returned 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, the faults forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20 yard kick to win a definitive 34-0.
These are the major points that Jets never made in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second or third room?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unresponsive points in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third.
They've earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebslelassie resting head its world record
Once again, Haile Gebslelassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider it the greatest runner in history, exceeding its own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable field race at 2:03:59, Gebslelassie destroyed for 27 seconds its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebslassie has established world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-relock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebslelassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebslelassie won this Sunday, using on average a cut 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebslelassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebslassie told journalists that he had suffered cramps two weeks before and had lost a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I am very happy," Gebslelassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end it was all right."
The athlete has been subjected to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the African-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, generally avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebslelassie as runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebslelassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebslelassie after their pace marks decreased.
But just before three miles from the goal, Gebslelassie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She did not take part in the Beijing Games either, so it was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes at the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and evidence of colour life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and the complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated into the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stage through its inclusion in Florida's travel guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outside world.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of Black claims and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes despised, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown into the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having concrete face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left hand," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the widow's new husband Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to the autonomous government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls who Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a live eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today is proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," followed Mr. Franklin.
But she adds, balancing on her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think your contribution to the world or your inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-rail road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-rail street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had resulted in the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing carried the hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
He was thrown into a car blunder."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "was insulting instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the breakdown of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the trust of its young people.
"The black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because I was white - there's a cultural gap there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went over prejudices, as she did, with boyant, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker left to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canons.
The road project came just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was under the spotlight again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The idea resurrected from the road to five tracks, would have been to put on what you would call bending speed, a real civic pride," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a revamped and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from central Orlando, it can sometimes feel like in a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men who work in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community can be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of birth pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the police department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Winter Park twins, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize to be in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to echo their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, like human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric printing hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to carry in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still expect to line up their bagel to the sellers' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon in the days of the week.
I felt as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that exist, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers all their life order their cheques, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from where they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a little like a construction society), credit unions and savings boxes from their home city whose branches only work within the state of belonging, and which they say treat customers as their family.
During last year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, broke into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers were heading to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers at the offices and shops that stayed in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Regular people in New York have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her afflicted executive director, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty and something concierge in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our talks about Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the tenant.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signals that represent mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties on the far right made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but researchers think that this may have occurred by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which came to Muslim religious as Ramadan ended.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that captured almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against head scarves and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent's police made the ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judiciary said: "On Thursday, 25 September in the Judgeship of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad such as France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad because he was under the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
A police spokesperson from Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A police spokesperson from Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the United Kingdom because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of the sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrate Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capto a maestro out of scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no star costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
Out of the way, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, at such moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, concerned because they are not going to go to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month programming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These portrayed people "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Mines", Bauer started in 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material recall the classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic base of the image, confirming modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the song or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with what is essential, with the duend that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Known flamenco figures like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portrait Portraits of Veteran Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment, either a long moment or a short moment.
I think within the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don't know, or that leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that bears the title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Fotómata, located on the 20th Street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until next October 16.
Vargas Llose confesses that the novel he writes is "a fear"
It is situated in places that are not yet known and is about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
He always preferred the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a fear" and that "everyone indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it was sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his intervention at the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he's seen going through the city of the Aqueduct for four days to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the opening of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a public delivered to whom he was made very short the hour at which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extro-garde adventure" of the "pleasing reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to supplement his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and re-making much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llose, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more inconform", so he asked the writers "not to give up on frivolity" and "take responsibility" for his vocation.
The climate change decreases the Pozoblanco fair, which also runs out of areas
The celebration of areas closing the subscription to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced areas that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Meteorological indemnities have been celebratory with this fair, since two of its three celebrations have finally not been possible.
On Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lock-up by Castilblanco.
So, only Friday was celebrated.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out to shoulder, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetic.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante went out with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tendons than his tore.
Yes, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief farm, a large part of the public was won.

Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Agents lift the two occupants of a van and they undertake the flight.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at N-1, in their passage through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were willing to stop a van for their inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, rushed sharply, and the control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle was stopped a couple of miles later in the arena, when their two occupants called to flee the race through a forested area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they were transporting and found after inspecting the van, a Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachis burdens, so they moved to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the truck documentation, so that the arrester had also been charged with an offence of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation into the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as it had been said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant proceedings and will be made available to the court within the next few hours.
Detained actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her car park in Montecito, as she has revealed to the magazine People a spokesperson for the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull out the car from the parking lot forward and backward, and going back passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not at first recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was shown to be cooperative and the excess of alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that had not been specified and entered the local prison around 1900 hours but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Appeals calls on the Andalusian Federation of IU to assume its powers in the case of Silva
The coordinator general of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of training which will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being charged with dealing in favour of relatives.
"I for these things am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," said Flames about the action that the party will have to take with which it so far advises in the Sevilla consistorium.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always defended that these issues have the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to " illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide range of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a film over two and a half hours, debuted this Friday in the cinemas, to become a miniserie for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid charged him three years ago to roll a commemorative tape for the second centenary of the 2nd May Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the account was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Community of Madrid has provided as a whole constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorations and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain that has been mistaken as the leader in fighting for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had such funding as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de May - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes shaped in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Return to Start, has focused on what is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the shooting and those who do not cast, because he seems "humilitant" and considers that "part of the director's office is to go to the theatre and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who coincide in Sangre de May repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to the Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood itself of May, Seven tables of French billiard and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you agree to make a more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillana dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillana dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillana dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dancistic and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to count his life but to collect his spirit.
His dance titles have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, just as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rapist of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also somehow recounts the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all Europe, since she was habitually living in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's about those women who have a huge influence at a given time and now nobody knows and much less puts their work into value," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poete Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light bowl", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Also, the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newly Founded Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicía", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and from all over America, in the striking idea that Newman has gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was very sick.
It's still been a trap for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or to exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire remain you, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and real.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dying of overdose to his home and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has been very hard to overcome is a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood muddled admiration without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he had not died a man but an era.
Another Englishman, the Oscared director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was no less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us the list very high for all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping up the requirement of probity and having a serious and remote private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but later married Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had the opportunity not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?", he used to joke himself.
He is proud in heaven that his daughters on earth coincide with their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, solicited grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics are held in Madrid and, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst race I've ever been in.
It would certainly be a very clear suspension if they took it into account as an assessment and I looked into it.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
Disproposing starts with the collection of the backend, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't look bad to me, but if they already get you to give it all up (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the backend (first disproposing, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the T-shirt (second disproposing, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper ones because of the crisis?
Well, things like these are a little bit like those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail on arrival is 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened to wait more than 40 minutes, which joined popular rebellion cones and assault the cassette.
I think about 500 people are probably going to have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my way out correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company's campus) according to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and tell him he'll be there soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we have talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essentials instead of carrying commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many pointed out correctly that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is the essential layer for Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications coming into the system for?
That's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its services online and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of Microsoft employees' restrooms in Redmond, early this month.
In the refreshment machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not reach the beginning of 2009 but the end, rather by shooting at 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that punctuated mustache force that raised weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's just the typical men's underwear shirt in cotton, belted and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which they call the English speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels points out about all the others.
First of all, because of her bountiful name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - that has to do with sport because she receives her name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'The Marcel' stands out over others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its top tanks.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine T-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to leave them like underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Presently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house esponorizes.
Warm and shy, wins in the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have designed my sister Penelope and me for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to lose myself in a city and watch women as they dress, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything unites and has many ties in common.
When I was a kid, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to search my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to look after my clothes.
You know that dancers like to do our stylisms for classes and rehearsals, to look at our mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you actually find the character.
So, everything is united, yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You didn't do that long ago, did you get into a crisis?
What's up.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're waiting for several stars that you rolled last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to you seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
See, they look like them...
You started a few days ago on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got on a walkway to make a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we displayed - I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioning to raise money for this NGO from Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he gets to ask me to do the pine, as well.
For the benefit of women in the third world, what is needed.
Repeated drivers due to alcoholemia must install the alcohol alcohol
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General ' s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is the reinstatement of the driver, so it will also receive a course of road re-education.
In addition to the Office of the Attorney-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fundación Instituto Tecnológico para la Seguridad del Auto (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 per cent of motorists reported more than once by driving drunks return to the car.
Alcohol would prevent it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the air inhaled and prevents the start of the car if the driver does not blow abate; or when an alcohol concentration is detected it is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is higher than 1000 euros and would run on behalf of the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people's lives each year.
The measure refers to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by regular means, and yet the necessary criminal reform requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial fashion, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE in which it intends to install this system in school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time scheduled for the programme, it landed in the Presidential Hangar at the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was retreating, but its rays still forced the hand to use viscera mode to see the real couple get off the plane.
On foot from the stairs, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver about the road, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official journey.
- Oh, very good, so you can't go to the airport to load at that hour... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here for a couple years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting at the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the rescue of honours.
The Prince appeared smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melancholy in the wind, very sober, did not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF threatened the storm.
They give a smile and a listening ear to the photographers before they move into the room where the official board is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four major cities, they are expected to receive a news reporter from Mexican television.
The best-equipped fashion award
There is likely to be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly not have a more exquisite and Bont live designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talent of fashion.
It is endowed with a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the Mango window in No. 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest shop in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart and heart tripping, for his brother's recent death, put on a suit of the House and some of ELAH's fittings, which cut the breath, and from the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner homage.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rothil, without a jacket, because he had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner turned into a long black sexy dress, was thrilled when on the evening walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'big plee'.
Inés Sastre didn't stand on the walk through the palace's dependencies, but before he showed us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon moving by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked for no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh here, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And in case it's little, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The awakening almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine getting involved in the tumultuous pace that today's life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a whole 'menu of possibilities adapted to everyone's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the Pearson Alhambra and DK editorial.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
It also offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very much are kept busy telling us something that's happened the day before, but children who talk when they're asleep.
The first time that happens is the best time you get scared, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign alteration of the dream that's called sleepwalking.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them told him he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (everyday, once a week, once a monthS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned, they may also be associated with very high fever rates, stress situations or overexcitation.
However, it is a phenomenon that has not been studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
You may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or anything else (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense, it would be useful to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to see if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him the way out.
We said it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another disturbance of the dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are afraid or a little violent.
With very nervous children and a great deal of relaxation, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer dream.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you won't remember anything about what's happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are feeling very distressed during several episodes, you should consult or find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to hear information from him.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep, you're not aware of how to organize your thinking.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of saying that, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even kidding.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rock the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn upstairs, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
On the front, we would not let the center camper pass and leave only Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Riahi and Temporal goal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illousians with the Marais goal, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the gulf Illhousiens will not be able to taste their happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and leave their teammates in inferior numbers.
But Dannemarie will not take the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illolusians who retreated a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major butterfly, the balloon passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a ride to Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several ports of Breton and Norman, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec last Tuesday morning in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope that " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesperson of Elíseo David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
Fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to soften the circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in nearly 10 km blockades.
The sport port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, by scratching the dawn, tyres and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the oxen remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday that will take place to the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Committee on Fisheries, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen have not left " and " they do not want to move to Paris ", for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached with only one gas oil at a price of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and a Destiny " has died because of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also saluted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.

AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insurer, who has been out of trouble thanks to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the edition of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper specifies.
The board of directors of AIG met last Sunday afternoon to examine any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 per cent participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been taken on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan that granted it the Federal Reserve at risk of seeing the US authorities take 80 % of its capital, dilute it with the due proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historical session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historical fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen in the 800-point Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, that is the day the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, was 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the standard & poor's 500 extended index 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans in three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would be "too late".
" If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. Central Bank, the Network N.) to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, Chief of Economy and Finance of the Global Insight.
And emphasizing further the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis dramatically accelerated, resulting in emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis," added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The return on the 10-year treasure bonus fell by 3,632 % against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bonus by 4,161 % against 4,357 % on the eve.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House took place to find out who has won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without any surprise, the general barracks of Republican and Democrat campaign proclaimed their own victory in this television duel which has been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honourable, was not "sufficiently "bright" to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% against 44% for McCain), considers it to be the Democratic who did well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them awarded McCain victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," however Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventeenth-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining his opponent's "ingenuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without being confused, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reprovoked the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
" During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had met for an election meeting in North Carolina in a rainy rain.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he thought, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that, despite the fact that 95 per cent of Americans would be taxed in spite of Wall Street shocks, the Illinois Senator also pointed out that the realization of possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates avoided issues relating to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk," "Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opposers manifested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, must resign " .
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "for what, since they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made foreign observers good in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes " , Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter the parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But its entry into parliament may mean television apparitions, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition was concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process did not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26 % of the voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission were congratulated on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec has again been one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster could no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, some provinces then established a committee that aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public ", he says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is extremely fragile."
Since its inception, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests that allow the presence of the virus in donors directly in the blood of donors, not those of anti-virus antibodies, on which the tests used so far were based.
Tests of nucleide acid allowed shortening the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period for less than a week.
We thus substantially reduced the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS due to blood transfusion.
Nowadays, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will pass more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover your health without concern," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You must be constantly vigilant ", pursue Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide adequate supplies.
" Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the network of blood donors that regroups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 % of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and cannot donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since today's life is very wild, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We held a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these out of the year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year," said Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this " since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program at all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win by 3-1 (4-3 in sum) at the shore of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series, in the Saputo Stadium.
Central Camper Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, Central Camper David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals opportunities.
Roger Levesque was the only one who beat Matt Jordan up for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the round and round series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured to Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it by 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should face Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is willing to start the season.
Alex Kovalev's unit, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn stimulated the attack on Canadian 3-2 free shots against the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I prevent Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play as much in the first place as possible, noting Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last large northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric, mining, Quebec, saw by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were displayed.
Large media such as during the election period.
The Prime Minister believes that the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space " , which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or a precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed above all is: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " according to Mr. Charest ' s enumeration.
This "land twice as large as France," is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the laughter towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, required the prime minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they haven't agreed for a long time and, when the occasion comes, I repeat that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will be opened every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec Party of Ungava), already started consultations around thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role in starting some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have considered differently to transform challenges into new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
" De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Borassa that made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, she invoked another reference, the conservative one, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its implementation is planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I expect to be there," he entrusted his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which is what the law allows him to do.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The General Council of the Week provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec particularly called for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the main lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on holiday today.
Letters - An dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in Harper's office, who last summer was allowed to say that Luisa Arbour was a " ashamed" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is closed in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts he was convicted of occurred.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and allows a child soldier to live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who stumbles by false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, particularly, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still do not realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morals exist: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government gave up what our country's reputation and dignity was doing.
Mr. Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
On September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world attempted a process of defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the case is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will dampen the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually made by changing ideas rather than by punching.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects requests and supporting letters for Noir Canada's authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to designate only the very paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it especially because you reject the brutal way of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes in arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-mordace (persisting the " public debate " ), Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to Noir Canada's authors, encouraging them to stop using this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of academic search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects who dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under much persecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he wants, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is high time that governments put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It foresees in particular: better control by those elected to implement it, of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public invested money, of new provisions to contain the number of houses including the lack of payment, and of a right to control the wages paid to the leaders of the relief companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which had joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, but they did not forget to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that would allow the owners to keep their home and the salary of the leaders of the State-surviving companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, no one should be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
" The important points I read [show] that is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the choice to do nothing is not acceptable."
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money dubious debts, venture and unspoiled assets from American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble which first led to the sinking of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a ban on banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elected men who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have emerged from the stagnation since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government rather than purchased.
With the aim of eradicating the odds for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take five years' losses with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get shares in the relief companies that will benefit it dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures for housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on metal compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see you put to the vote by the House of Representatives today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, it is not yet certain that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, told his voters that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not what it is to take advantage of taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) during the risk real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Boss yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that the savers and families now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and over EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one to buy the British bank's branches and bank accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes so long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, his sensitivity and an obvious talent would also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years of age, due to lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons in American cinema of the past few years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom it seemed a lot and which was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last mark of quality.
Because in it an entire country was projected in love with self made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning in theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the driver who was second ranked in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while their great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual movement parade through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the cute cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we remind your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to the history of cinema.
This gratisian Rocky boxer, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hatred), by Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly manganette in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar to the best film in 1973.
Bitter Billiard and Avenger player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who valued him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during their career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on low-orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role of godfather of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was rizo.
Contrary to several film legends that abandoned the career quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its envelopes and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier looked at him with humor " as a challenge that he lived in " the underplaying " and judged his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his true public sensitivity not well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
" Among the numerous honors that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood's excesses.
We will have seen his face reigning over the vinegar sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal trial will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant damage fraud, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes by justifying on many occasions the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in their entirety about 65 million HUF - partially stopped in the treasury of the Fial Baloldal organization and in part in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was also revealed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the charge, most invoices were false.
To this end, they obtained the Talonaires in the Józsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour by the Balaton Superior Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested invoices for his consumption, and they served as a model to make the invoices that were presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András ★ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides he chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Pont Egyesület Biztos Association.
However - according to the centre manager - so many people do not fit at all in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however in the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the big-time invoice manufacturers also overstated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomy centre. Because in the book hold of it - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he knew that these were false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: besides the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest only organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
Furthermore - as was known during the investigation - VAT was included in the document too, although travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of the company were not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, besides the hotel employees only extended invoices made to machine however the invoice was manual.
Moreover, the "consignees" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company where they put on the invoice as an activity carried out road transport to which - it was known during the prosecution investigations - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false seal - it is known that invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The falsifiers did not pay any attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Varosért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyiregyháza was in liquidation, so the head of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
They consciously issued invoices
Another group of false invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialistak, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredert.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the accusation - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Likewise, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, without real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, for later the invoices prepared but forgot to record their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL headquartered in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian whom Ivan Kubatov should have also issued company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that issued invoices to the company for Atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány charging the amount itself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since, at the request of his accomplice, counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for organizations associated with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generácio.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoices.
This man even took advantage of the company in command of Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the Pont Biztos contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
To keep this undiscovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpad Kemecsei had at the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main accused himself, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, he has not done so until now.
The question is: What interest does it have in doing so? Perhaps in exchange for the return of most money - 50 million HUF - the Socialists have reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days might even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, freely pass or at least can wait for the sentence in their own home, he has no chance for it.
Overlapping psychology: Why spend more money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological bases - economics of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists have tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in a auction and was being examined through the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental element to bet more than the other, by losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto prize" of the nervous system.
According to scientists, increased betting is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate his theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups waged against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned, and its members betted.
In addition, another group was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case the auction was lost, even that money was lost.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to wager even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only the visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York's economic faculty.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around the world some five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body humor viruses (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested by a general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and white of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected is treated pharmacologically.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are now about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eliminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September, World Hepatitis Day was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less who they believe in God?
According to a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviates the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British Telegraph newspaper.
Within the framework of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists applied electric shock, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was found that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University are also involved.
The analysis occurred in the following way; they set a sparkly instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their eyes on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, work of 17th century Sassoferrato and the Lady of Armamin by Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the painting of religious theme or the other.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their hearts peace reigned."
By looking at the religious background, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image that is so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you only have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positively, as if by a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases truly change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday Google can say: you can find it in people's pocket, as well as in the sky above their heads; you know where they spent their holidays, what doctors visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this isn't enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as many personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to achieve the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather all the information in a system of the world!".
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world is still in the initial phase of the commitment to be able to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied this way: I want Google to be able to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that I would best like?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions apparently so simple until there are enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that the search keywords, IP addresses and pages are precisely stored during their online browsing.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more customised searches - on this same logic recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be feared and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they do not only preserve, but in justified cases also give third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google handed the information to the Brazilian government on its website, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about the rights of individuals, in May, were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that was right in their dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to supply any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain its pretext to strengthen the child protection law adopted years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: those who fear to supply their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vant-garde incorporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows conqueror of the World, however much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks younger, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that just occurred by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have profiles on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers list of their music habits, then they can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, where you automatically appear the latest photo galleries that are stored in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases from which it turns out that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion in his blog about the company's management: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
The "on line" life of a person is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of the youth of today.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least intends to avoid Google's monopoly, can do it (e.g., starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to image and read news applications with alternative versions that do not connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day that Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agency revenues, while services that are introduced faster and faster cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the employee's protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of food employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company under the agreement filtered out all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it is ready to work, which is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will be able to revolve around the world: while some believe that Google's draft scan and archive of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scrogled, novel of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped clear the traces to the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to suspicion, helped clear the traces of the crime - said the spokesperson of the General Public Order Commissioner of the province of Borsod on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently being accused of crime offenders.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves free.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He was charged with the crime of killing several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large amount to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he named his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the nine-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to information from the IRM, the young man prepared himself long before committing the crime, for he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State who within a few months wishes to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by the stakeholders for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week declared that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
The experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the ever deeper international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11th".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American President - opinion The Republic of Rome - the President has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it is more appropriate to talk about a "second September 11th".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, the mistake of the United States political leadership led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then affect the entire world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You cannot ignore this threat - points out the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still drop life-belts from the tamble financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if, as dominoes demolition more banks, then they will no longer be sufficient new funds, nor will new improvisations.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and to centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are increasingly concerns that, as the Americans have done, European taxpayers must also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis that is going on like an old Continent .
"Savers" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater harm?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the honeybee
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the beekeepers.
In a surprising project presented at the Japan CEATEC, the beekeepers provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the system of robotic driving cars type BR23C imitator of nature, which gave it the characteristics of beejors, with the ultimate objective of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each honeybee creates its own particular ovated space that actually looks a lot like our safe capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of beeches that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the beeches, modifies the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any current system, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety-protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other beepers.
This process must be carried out in an open and close eyes.
However, unlike beejors, the movement cannot move upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the steering direction of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for beekeepers to avoid other beeches, here only used as a possibility for the auto robot the rotating movement and acceleration also the braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is greater, which means that they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is instinctive and intelligent reaction, not data processing capacity, nor much less storage capacity.
This device in each second must only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte memories, or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles that exist on his way.
You already have this dear child's name.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared to be applied in various phases to buy bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to Eastern Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the conference leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion total financial rescue package, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, claiming that only formalizing the agreement in a document is necessary.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the compromise stated: this programme will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning it back to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8:00 p.m., according to Washington schedule (i.e. before 2:00 p.m. on Monday, according to Central Europe schedule), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the Emergency Act for Economic Stabilization of 2008, the first Monday will vote for the North American Congress and then for the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also held the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from Bush's original proposal to spend all $700 billion on poor quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress probably votes on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will buy securities from credit fund, bad rating and the destination of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad credits, mortgages and securities credit fund values, plus other "venous" credits as well.
The purchase may be made in auctions or directly - informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, by which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, that they may even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, insurance or risk prevention that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and wait for state aid may count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American argot simply calls gold parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
Limitation means that if the ministry buys under a auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the bankrupt bank boss retires.
By directly buying the bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses' compensations are not overstated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the revenue of the Directors General - said this measure the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, responsible for the financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can ultimately even obtain profits from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and the bank with it.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the American citizens told us to do, that is to say they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - declared the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him to be responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Internal sales prices in the processing industry have increased at least by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The higher price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector ( 2.8 per cent), due firstly to the increase of 4.6 per cent per month in bags and belts and the increase of 2.5 per cent in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in chemical material production industry prices (1.6 per cent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electric machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).

Won't you need a visa next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian agreement on visa exemption to come into force about 12 January - the foreign minister spoke of this in Chicago, before Hungarians living there.
In his opinion "practically everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on time across the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system, the entry premium will be removed, but tourists must register before their departure from the country of origin.
From now on, the Hungarian diplomacy chief is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties assured their support for the government's $700 million banking aid programme on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and administration, after several marathon days negotiations, announced in the early hours of Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama once again gained some advantage and disappeared from McCain's advantage that he had obtained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for Vice-Presidentship.
In a meeting of the Detroit campaign held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) employment is in danger, you save, besides whole industries and stability of the whole economy" - he said to a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not take the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain he explained that "we'll all swallow this up hard (...) but doing nothing simply isn't a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Fines and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted with the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi stated on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right group is intact, only that within the group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had assumed its position.
Social Christians for decades were developing in Bavaria - and now precisely these modern citizens are the ones behind them.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had already been foreseen for almost ten years now ended: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years now, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only that within the group itself they became the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have moved further away from the CSU; the autonomous, the small industrial, those who have bachelors and the graduates.
Thus, less than 40 percent of support for the CSU was denied.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition matters" - deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for negotiation, the green ones on the other hand still do not want to make consultations on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let a glimpse of their fights.
Werner Faymann, the president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, at the post of Vice Chancellor.
He stated that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Manyerer responded cautiously to red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, and its host is France, who is also President-in-Office of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the whole, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are out of the labour market first because of their low level of schooling.
"Most Roma young people have not finished middle school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain university diploma."
Járóka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role to play in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, these issues need to be made widely aware of both Roma and non- gypsies.
As soon as school starts, a Gypsy student will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up school segregation processes immediately, which is why it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly complied with.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting, held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be taken on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their positions, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the special convention of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-critical duo left an interview: they do not cling so much to their posts.
In this way, they sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and its basic organization, who one day after the "tsunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under Edmund Stoiber's leadership that was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead, now, one year after the hit attested against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopolie" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will no doubt have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-wing Free Electoral Officers on a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electoralists, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the coupo Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly removed from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition you will also receive an active role Stoiber who has so far been moving the ropes at the bottom, the former provincial government chief and former president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel herself too.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be a chancellor unless they are able to enhance the CSU together, which played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide his disappointment because of the failure, the losses of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
What is naturally relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition Member in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE that sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, composed of 10 per cent and 10 deputies, has not opposed more than a decade ago, before the elections of yesterday's opposition united under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, would "allow" the entry of some of the opposition's deputies into parliament.
So the ODSZ deleted the boycott that I originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly depends on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline passing through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which did not give permission to enter Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered anti-democratic.
It was a sign of distancing when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, focused rather on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participating in a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
In the view of the opposition, however, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released, and Minsk was ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal State - already a month ago considers the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even one opponent into that parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, but rather tries to get the voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that they are increasingly those who support the change between older people too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, they do not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security that "is similar to the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers opposed the opposition politician described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you will have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the History of Chigi Palace that set up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but since today it starts with this measure against who fixes and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, more productively, more presence and more services," the minister said.
"There is now a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is Reformism," highlights Brunetta again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found by employees, the secretary general says: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration by them."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and midnight.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good hood at 7 am is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months absences for public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, that means 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that there is a need for more effective public administration
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree by acceding to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism of work due to the causes of illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the 'labour workers' are constantly increasing.
It is indeed millions in Italy that employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war to the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of added economic treatments due to illness due to service; the extension of the time zones in which medical check-ups of the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions deared by the Minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Criminal Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day by the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial is the question of prevention at work," says President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the ongoing association effort towards the prevention at work, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion."
"It has been manifested, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, provoke the clamoring of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand, the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular meaning takes the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an end to it urgently."
"Data on accidents at work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white deaths as impressive," noted the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not, indeed, want this "tenance to decrease" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at general level too little is still done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - because it concerns communication and public awareness.
But, above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for the victims of work" and the "assistant decline towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - it has added - because the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator at any time."
Mp3 readers under charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injury to the hearing.
The European Commission refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging Health Risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today in a communiqué published in Brussels.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific evidence – following EU responsibility – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have a step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this caused.
"Scientists - concludes executive EU - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related apparatus."
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices are listening to loud (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week above the current limit on maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, the accounts will be held in June.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fuck of the Capital of Rome", which was established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Termas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the council would evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bubble" of the Municipality and its German deputy Gianni.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to stress German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no remaining position of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, German answers: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that return to manifest themselves..
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and into the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
The Roma mayor also notes that "this Commission is neither a useless nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolutely need, thinking with a united spirit to its future."
A future that requires the steward of Rome" will not only be limited to the present municipal boundaries but also to look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in going independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he does today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
a Miami lady wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he believes he will win the highest position of the nation he has had two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and don't answer the voters' question: will you be a good president? And they're also polls; they all say Obama wins and with a good advantage.
In this case too, there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the depths of the South of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know well who will vote the American patriot.
Get out one side of the American mentality covered to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you ever win Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Also, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Who will take over George W's position will have an enormous duty to develop.
Uses, economic collapse also makes the journalists feel: in newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "kill" for the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been asked by Pew Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the paper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands is not expected to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today on the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is following the wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are warning has increased by up to 79 per cent.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of executives at the national level are assured that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with the "safety of work."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it."
Directors almost always receive good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, one after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, on their admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA BEING GUTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the property order Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the area of anti-contract investigation concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained the house release, turning it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the city of the province to a room of the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 million-dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
We are given a confirmation yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become dominant with the vote of those who spoke at first.
This is just mentioned is just one example of the mutations, of the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerating of incubation phenomena that are solidified and brought to light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, extraordinary re-activation, of the dual status-sovereignity category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance, if they had strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in one country and in one state are much more compromised.
One who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or have little to say: the crucial test is the European Union that divides as always between different interests and different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all fund subsidies: from the moment they reach the court, it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market will likely and no organization will ever be able to have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of intangibles, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future would instead have to make more and more accounts with little inmaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So, whoever is sovereign, certainly has many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but predestines a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Policy and Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who can take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of inadequately elevated economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to progress ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before its actions are the same as those of the social elites so far at the height, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the inclusive exception of the term, to have done the same time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, manifesting themselves in an electoral "revolution" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also layered with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say no, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what is now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and shakes potentially in mismeasures.
In front of all this, we are talking about a "mass rebellion" today is quite frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Conquer the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With a adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflone and lija paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "take off the walls easily" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the engineering college of the University of Dayton.
WALKING BY PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Caps to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Caps do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that self-cleans themselves from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken concurrently with some drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed as fresh as associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of apple, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The grape juice was already under accusation because some anti-arithmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products were held responsible for increasing to toxic levels.
PHARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had reported in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drinking in the case a drug is being taken, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by apples and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These findings are generally pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why we must always read the package leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, let us not be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly» stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist at the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical decisions of the Bush administration in terms of economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack on Enron, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been reprobed to the economy, but has now been shown to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the outbreak of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom has quickly disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical divulner against the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0 launch, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work on the part of the volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse revised interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also put to multi-function with the Office suite 2007, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphics module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in several users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English mirror since Friday.
Furthermore, for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd to home or to work.
And if the free theme can be a hook for home dissemination, it is in business that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already able to count on several projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there is not even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eat in the case of the known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached nearly 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the figure will be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third-ranked and winner of the best climber.
To give the news is the L'Equipe newspaper site.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive corridor to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl blood champions enters among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will be angry against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm Kohl’s positive doping news to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding the mermaid of the best climber.
Immigrants:new YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy as an immigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted itself to the debate on racism in Italy based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who had killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they record "more integration and more work" but also the country's highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation loved by the League also tightens the immigration brake and facilitates the expulsion of illegal persons is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trends marked by the Pope are that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Student victims of rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the last Sunia survey, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has totally distorted the market to such an extent that it triggers a process of widespread increase even for residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-style contracts, not registered, without canon limit, under related rentals.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the revision of tax taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Faira) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros per one bed and 450 for an individual room in the area Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
in the most girl cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and extra-Community rentals is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinemas close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, it's like an eyeless face."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photograph effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great methics on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Almost always disappearing are historical places, full of memory, "it's as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion," observes the director of the new movie Paradise, the film that 20 years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema room and the nostalgia for the way to live the film that may be lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main trader association, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and paying for most are mostly the rooms of the main cities: 10 minus in Florence, 9 minus in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 minus in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 less cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions have recorded the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 is in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer themselves to the meticians.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
In order to sustain the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first such in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historical center that in the periphery.
The proposed rules include means of tax facilitation for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates.
"It's an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true that in order to contrast the extra power of the meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closing of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realize the "New Paradise Cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of the already closed National Road, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the signs blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side".
Bond between politics and 'drangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to even the municipal elections for the interested parties to the Pyromalli cosca."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the steward and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association.
arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by mob criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral rule, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to consult counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family would have been allowed - the judges write - to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loirero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrests this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the town council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Udc's deputy, at the time of the dissolution, after the balloting in May 2006, had been elected as head of a right center coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of organizing everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
Of the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of Mafia families."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down to the stage
It is an extinct site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they look to big ones like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from the sea's movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much of the production currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be currents and tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – the spokesperson of a company associated with ha has declared the American oil colloquium to the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a fairly important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now impacts such as those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, technology must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good bonding between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping centre and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, causes the turbine pallets to rotate, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, now deserves the potential of tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
