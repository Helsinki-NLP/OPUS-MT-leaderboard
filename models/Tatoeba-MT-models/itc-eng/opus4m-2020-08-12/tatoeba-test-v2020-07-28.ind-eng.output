Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religions.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife was too dull to use to cut meat, I finally used my pocket knife.
Behind his eyes was the blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a forgetful.
Where have you been?
The traffic lights are used to set up traffic.
Don't let Tom see these photos.

He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have breached that red light.

Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
You want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes!
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never be able to find a way home, through a narrow rock road.
Tom really wasn't home when we came to visit him.

Isn't that awful?
I'll buy you this bag.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the deep water.
Have you ever gone to London?
It's our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.

Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.

We've got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I had suspected that he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.

The election of that time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
We are all equal before the law, but the rich sometimes have more benefits.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
The meeting's over at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We're facing a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.

They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of the students went to university education.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom slowed down his voice so no one could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long-haired?
She greets him every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very dirty, it's better on the left.
We didn't really see the accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We ordered that at six thirty.
We called it Tim.
He opened the letter fast.
Where's the train station?
Tom ordered Mary to follow him.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm smarter than they are.
It's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.

The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
