Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a home for unknown atiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which cure.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe injury requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the developments in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe based on WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Acquisition of the cumulative number and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to draw a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8.00 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase was reported around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, on 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 increases rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential changes in case definitions, as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch tests.
Early in March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy indicated that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or in intensive care service are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not submitted).
However, systematic collection is necessary to supplement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios relating to the saturation of the care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the early ECCM risk assessment for COVID-19.
Given that the cases were so far grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom countries, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally accommodate a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be established at level 2 of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care, as in affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of ECCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from an approach to an approach to mitigation, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without this, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The 2019 coronary artery disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 presents a lesser severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this ongoing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will be involved in better understanding and eradicating this serious illness.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, marked the Chinese, who were forced to remain closed for the entire duration of the golden week as well as for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly similar to coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) epidemic in 2003; this is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of China before extending to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number one", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 with the virus sequence isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new topic in full development.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and forecasting, and will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered to be non-mortal human pathogens, mainly causing about 15% of common rum 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronary virus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig.1.1, pneumonia homes of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 by the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered to be the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO qualified the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to the whole of China as well as to almost 50 other countries worldwide (Fig.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65-year period.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years of age, very little under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100 000) more than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the outskirts.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincided with the massive movements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender, age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple ring RNA.
They can be classified as four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the human belonging to the alpha and beta genres.
The envelope's Spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virion, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the outbreak site, the seafood market from Huan to Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electronic transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receiver of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secret protein coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of INFβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known functional areas or motives.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human cryo-ME structure of the ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimerum and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to Man via civets and camelaides, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect the Human remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., assumed that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply a similar recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-range mammal feeding on ants, often used in Chinese traditional medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by 99% genetic homology performed between a kronovirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % gap between two genomes is a difference of importance; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 % ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the immune system innate through molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll (TLR), NOD (NLR) and RIG-I (RLR) receptors.
By different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I Interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by inducing their apoptosis.
Humour immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes localized explosions in the number of free radicals, which can result in serious lung damage as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, multi-visceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but generally more than 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine according to as precise a period of incubation as possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should 40 be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have had dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
Regarding serious cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A population study carried out at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies on one family and one home following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a population study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SARS.
With regard to SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed worldwide.
By comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a household often occurs within a family or in a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or in other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals may be virus carriers without having symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients may again be virus carriers, which emphasizes the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimera rate, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
thoracic X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or a depolitic glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In case of ADDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromises gas trade.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the rate of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the severest form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocytes disqualification, hyalin membrane formation, interstitial lymphocytial infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with viral infection pathology and ADDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR for the purposes of detecting SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape in less than one hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other conavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restored patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OCEM), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory impairments.
Furthermore, maintaining electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction has been found to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include the modulation of the T-cell immune response, the blockage of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, the inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, the cytokines 4 signaling suppressor, and HCAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including a vascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short low to moderate dose corticosteroid cycles was recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, proved effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-line RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver lesions and other side effects may occur as a result of combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma restorer patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, restored patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies against the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
As a result, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms have improved within 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
Antibody concentration in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat patients who are seriously ill is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells from restored patients and to identify the genetic codes that code the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would increase the production of antibodies rapidly.
TCM has been used for millenniums in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theories of the TCM.
Most effective components remain little or no known insofar as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of a specific effective treatment of COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate or severe symptoms of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in provinces of China using TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan region (50%), while Hubei province, which has only used up to 30% of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his employees published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and combined treatment involving MO and MTC.
It was found that the time of return to normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% to 46.2%); likewise, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remain to be clarified through larger-scale controlled tests and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterise the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally have a deep concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some blame for the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Mitigation of live vaccines have been assessed on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in older people and in models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, insofar as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic homes of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for SARS using the inactive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important time period (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic changes in coronavirus.
Insofar as it is an emerging disease, the COVID-19 begins its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 years of age according to a study of 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were much older (median age 66 years from 51 years), suggesting age as a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 compared to 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which may result in hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also participate in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, particularly at heart and liver levels, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
Therefore, they traditionally form markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with the other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in addition treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors had a vascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, patients often suffering from long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support in order to help these individuals overcome this stress and to regain a normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the first phase of the infection, like coronaviruses at the origin of common rums.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly hampers the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients who were seriously ill, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the sampling of the average nasal cornet and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their release from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive decrease of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial forecasts, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to a quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was eventually placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectiousness in order to eventually extinguish or evolve into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with Man.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough or eternation, as well as possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in saddles, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virons able to penetrate completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the sized SARS-CoV, since both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients carry N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor proved to have infected SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered its body by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent vision or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to stay confined to maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert status after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre assured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it presented limited inter-human transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies must learn from them and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has expanded to China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
Insofar as this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression of you.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may again be positive to the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, a number of critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to safely conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the original host virus, e.g. bats, to man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus penetrate into the respiratory cells and how does it result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long is the epidemic going to last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, even if this may take time, to obtain answers to all these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter what expenses this may entail, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients experienced severe lower respiratory infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Apart from the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could approximately generate two secondary cases with a period of incubation between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspected SARS.
Common alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research on HCOV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent among young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchioliitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal removal of an 8-month-old male with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchioliitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory disease.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and to maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of SARS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an acutely evolving pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with SARS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of SARS in relation to HCOV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high rate of death, or 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most known human fatal viruses.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCOVs (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saddle samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenicity and its sustainable spread after transmission to humans, will affect the ultimate destiny of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs caused moderate symptoms were well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of HCoV's previous pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must be replicated in humans in sufficient proportion to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host's restriction factors.
In this context, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more the number of infected people is important, the more likely the virus is to be completely adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about forty or by other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to achieve potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCOVs acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired and less pathogenic HCOVs than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among these without animal tank or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of the HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it houses a nearby ascendant that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a host tank houses HCOV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the middle host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the middle host becomes a natural tank host.
In particular, given that 80% of Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several small mammal species can also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the basis for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The conversion enzyme of human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
That is why bats cannot be host to the intermediate container of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that the dromadairs were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excret the virus not only by respiratory pathways but also by faeces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even less important than that between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be derived from the mouse-powder coV, while the HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 parent viruses were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camhelides were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infecting humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the interspecies transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat near the HCoV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpagas.
The alpha-CoV of HCoV-229E-related bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogen viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCOV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while mouse bald alpha-CoV is used as a genetic reservoir of HCOV-229E, alpagas and dromadaria could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of bats to human Dromads and Dromads.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and was also enhanced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in dromadairs for decades.
It was well adapted in these camels that passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV of the pangolin are highly pathogenic in the pangolins.
Several potential inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans has been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be host to a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through scraping or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and consuming game meat.
Many mammals including domestic animals may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species having been in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-line RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the COV adaptation phase to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the rate of mutation of the CoVs is about one million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs did not suit the host well.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of change of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the dromadairs.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, the CoVs change randomly and frequently as a model when replication of the RNA through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for animal coVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different portion of the protein S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidasis N for HCOV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCOV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromadairs and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCOV: return to check-in
The diversity of bat coVs offers numerous opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCOV.
Among the adjunct proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they codified divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal splits the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is presented as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic had episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in the dromadairs in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpaga alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a shift from the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by coVs, indicating mutual adaptation between coVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were well adapted to VOCs from anatomic and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, generating the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared over the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host reservoirs such as bats and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe human infection remain.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more severe the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
However, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response was derived from the replication of the VOC.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, administration of Type I Interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a mouse-powder beta-Cov sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-Cov was discovered, there is also a mouse-powder cov sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-Cov-2.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 were discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The VOCs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadair for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets for wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, coupled with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, mouse-powder CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in certain parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continued surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a SARS-CoV-2 parental virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true middle host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is bat, pangolin or other mammal, we should identify SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause diseases.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary artery disease and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during births at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory disease and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soapwashing.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under the age of five, which is nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Washing hands also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent handwashing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too common hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (CTO).
The deparasitation twice a year, associated with the daily washing of the hands of soap and the daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil matter, are difficult to solve in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not help to reduce microbial burden on hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The alcohol effect can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients resulted in significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic substances present in their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, since they remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Furthermore, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of diseases rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The friction action creates friction, which helps eliminate the germs from the skin, and rub longer removes more germs.
Rinse plenty of running water.
Washing in a stagnant watershed can lead to the recontamination of hands.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands are recoupling more easily.The most often forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, finger-toe spaces and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nail and square nail varnish can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drought promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a canon or gourd suspended and pierced and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "typy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended hook using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand-drying is an essential part of the hand-hygienic process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air dry hands, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the thumbs and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air-jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
Following the drying of hands, the following changes in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant cloths is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical washing of hands should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to bite and rub each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel shall be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The objective of hand-washing in health structures is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/to a biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsed, water on the forearms must be prevented from flowing to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand-washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the hand-washing frequency beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build handwashing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote the hygiene of the hands that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Day of Handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote behavioural developments.Following the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fetid odors called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand-washing techniques" were placed next to the sinks in the public toilets and in the toilets of office and airport buildings.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.

Because it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which are very likely to result from the pressures exerted in the selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
For example, the loss of complete ORF4 in the HCOV-229E prototype strain can be cited as a result of a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpaga alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a shift from the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by coVs, indicating mutual adaptation between coVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were well adapted to VOCs from anatomic and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low level of expression of molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen reactive derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, generating the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared over the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host reservoirs such as bats and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe human infection remain.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more severe the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
However, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response was derived from the replication of the VOC.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of Type I Interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a mouse-powder beta-Cov sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-Cov was discovered, there is also a mouse-powder cov sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-Cov-2.
While civets and other animals present in the markets were discovered as carriers of the same virus in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 were discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has been designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The VOCs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civettes present in the markets, the closure of the fresh product markets and the slaughter of the civettes found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the markets of fresh products to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the studies to follow.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadair for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the markets for wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, coupled with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, mouse-powder CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
Opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new more transmissible and/or mortal coVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in certain parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many positive characteristics for virus diffusion, the probability for humans to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continued surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if bats transmit a SARS-CoV-2 parental virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true middle host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is bat, pangolin or other mammal, we should identify SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will lead to the elucidation of the evolving trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCD-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronary heart disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of conavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute conavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
She has raised a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Commission on Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially amended.
Our directive, having received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided further evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspicious case must involve one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical events to form a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in the space of 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total numbering of white blood cells indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of all viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronaviruses; (3) positive-time IgM and IgG antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2; or change of the specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody from negative to positive or increased titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogen screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory pathways including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibody in confirmed criteria.
Moreover, more and more evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in one day.
The country thus records a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered contaminated persons included 114 active cases and 33 healed persons, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded the million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted on the extension of the national state of emergency of 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially deadly an infection with HCOV.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they are not pathogens.
Some HCoV intermediate reservoir hosts are also known.
Identification of host animals has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host CoV interactions in animals could also increase the understanding of human CoV.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, the VOCs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genus Bêta-CoV contains the majority of the VOCs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the genetic source role for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV whereas birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human coVs (HCOV) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of HCoV's zoonotic origins provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the barrier of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the container, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal VOCs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and then adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had symptoms of classical rum, including headaches, sneezing, malaise and throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present worldwide and appear to be mainly broadcast in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores have reduced their toilet paper purchase restrictions to two and a package per purchase at all stores at national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits were displayed in the form of messages to the cassettes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently had reservations in fear of the COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to a package per order.
These measures resulted from the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock breakage within the hour following delivery," and rated the application as "unprecedented", while AlDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, described it as "unforeseen."
Sales had a "great increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while Aldi made earlier available stocks for a planned promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery times make the task difficult.
It foresees an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the anticipated release of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores re-supply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [bought] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Givens a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock breach.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures the Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page board designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce buying restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization qualifies COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word " pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to motivate governments to act:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries test, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only at alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also at alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "other respiratory viruses have not been observed since their onset until their continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regarding the epidemic: "To be brief, the situation will get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of ongoing conavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute conavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and exhaustion.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can range between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confining those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world responded by introducing restrictions on travel, quarantine, curfews, risk controls at workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred in Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance from East and South-East, as well as in other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a home of unknown cases of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to Huanan's seafood wholesale market and so it is thought that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, the coronaviruses of pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person who presented symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent link to the subsequent home of the fresh products market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, two-thirds of the household were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report by South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could start on November 17, 2019, with a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with beneficial symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among the 19-year-old and less representative of 2.4 per cent of the world’s cases. UK Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested in COVID-19, and the test was confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had had as official policies not to test those who had only good symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of the COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been charged to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% were pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who were tested positive to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual COVID-19 victims could be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partly data from Italy shows that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokesperson from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global death report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the death report decreased by 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (letality rate), which represents the percentage of diagnosed persons who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of contaminants (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) that succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall pandemic infection rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for the COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on the estimates of lethality.
WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, generally infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to recreate when the disease is missing guests available.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen.”
The chief medical adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be completed by June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to a study by Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—disappears completely" and that it "can become a seasonal disease, capable of re-appearing every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (mucosities), loss of odorate, exhaustion, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysia, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult wakes, and face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome, septicemia, septicism, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with results on the test that confirm the infection, then researchers have made recommendations that people who have had close contact with infected confirmed persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of asymptomatic ratio ranged from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) varies between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people carrying the COVID-19 who lost the odorate was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted primarily in close contact and fine drops produced by coughing, evaluating, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through fine drops that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory drops can also be projected at expiration, especially by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Posillons may land in the mouth or nose of other people located next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus lead to air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by the saddle, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive to the disease up to three days before symptoms occurred suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of confirmed asymptomatic cases in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, one person generally infected two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend washing their hands after they have touched animals, as having been in contact with other areas that infected people may have affected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three patients with pneumonia associated with Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenre Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is the same as 96% of the entire genome of another sample of bat crownviruses (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin virus and human virus.
The comparison of the entire genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of the infected secretions or scan.
A study comparing the PCR and the scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first-intention test to diagnose the COVID-19."
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sampling but can also use a throat sampling. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomodenytometry (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric depolitic glass opacityes and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology currently constitutes an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Because of the combination with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive networks of neurons based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in imaging both on radiographs and scanners.
The disease transmission prevention strategies include overall having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who were already contaminated should wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals are advised to take care of someone who might be infected to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. Contact research is an important method so that health authorities can determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of telephone tracking data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for such monitoring limits.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive to the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, to rinse your nose and to pee with a mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after being bitten, coughed, or wiped.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands with a volume of at least 60% when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of disinfectant exposure to an stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropanol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and iodine at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or a nursery, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their foldd elbow or a handkerchief when they cough or vanish, and to throw every handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected posillons by speaking, emmercing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at Leeds University, "Having a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of their hands."The use of masks was also recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they deal with a patient with COVID-19, even if they recognize that wearing the mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks in fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded locations.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited public exits without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect himself and others.
The Austrian government ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the mask on long-distance train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by remaining at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowds, greeting themselves without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by the U.S. government and health agencies has been reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus, they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social links, whether virtually or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the idea that a total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sexual intercourse only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or does not present the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and those who thought they were infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to the people of the most at-risk groups.
Persons who were exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who had recently traveled to a country or region where transmission was very important were invited to sit in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are induction or suppression, and mitigation.
Indigoment is introduced during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When disease spread is no longer possible, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow this spread and to mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Indication and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures in order to reduce the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saving time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures aimed at reducing the epidemic have been taken in China as the seriousness of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the placing of forty whole cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced localized mass screening and quarantine, and has issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have become quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The elimination may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise transmission is rapidly rebounding when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking drugs without prescription against cold or drinking as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and handicraft remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, by separating and isolating patients tested positive to COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could start on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of the province of Hubei, who informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation early in January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major rail correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were healed.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted the movement and put in place border controls.
National responses included measures of indigo such as quarantine (also called orders to stay at home, shelter on site or confinement) and fire cover. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subjected to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people in the world had a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would go back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of unknown cases of pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning to have "punished rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear proof" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to signal the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the biggest quarantine of human history", a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop the trips from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year (January 25th) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government has introduced new measures to address the epidemic of COVID-19, including the issue of health reports for travellers and the extension of holidays for Spring.
The universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The population displacement control was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) were involved in one form or another of travel restrictions. After the epidemic entered the world stage in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, in mainland China, a single case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.

WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that hampered prevention and induction efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the New Moon Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that even if it was not a WHO recommendation, it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and spoke of a fact "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "there is no reason why measures should interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called upon the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, calling for the urgent support of those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect those who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear."
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the “force of the entire United Nations system into the response”.
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the overall response of the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to “focus on health response while other agencies will be able to provide their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic”.
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was launched in China to deploy international experts and WHO on-site in China to support national management and evaluate "severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at provincial and county level, including urban and rural environments." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronary virus pandemic", indicating that although it is too early to speak of pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter "preparation phase".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team on-site to assess the situation.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to keep ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan then stated that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On March 11, WHO stated that the coronary heart disease could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General indicated that WHO was "extremely concerned at both alarming levels of propagation and severity as well as at alarming levels of inaction."

Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were identified for their functions following their management of quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of policy makers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronary virus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronary virus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracyist theories claiming that the COVID-19 would hold its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump described the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "the censorship has overpowered a virus now become a global pandemic", which was then taxed by some opponents of racism and intended to "distort attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has sought a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "Everything comes from China.

The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio have denied media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a medical aid cargo aircraft to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutine] is based on the principle that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to make them the same if necessary."
The scope of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's biggest manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.

Iran President Hassan Biencio wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to adversely affect Donald Trump's re-election opportunities during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's "intangible and passive forty-year efforts" after the latter announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed two weeks in quarantine on sites designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with mismanagement of the government's epidemic or, on the contrary, praising its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.

The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Products Agency issued warnings regarding the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand for consumers and disruption of suppliers.
Several locations have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for individual protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This application led to an increase in prices up to 20 times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic has offered a new opportunity to the daggers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that has been pursued, these two areas have been spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Due to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not see a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily emptied, even in Wuhan City, while Chinese government members have released pig reserves to ensure sufficient livelihoods for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

In China, most of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stuck at home in domestic provinces or stuck in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronary virus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) to unemployment. The investigation by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees shifted to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German partial-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts sectors of the show and cultural heritage have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed, worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and at different degrees, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new orders and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also had an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place on the last week of the period of Christian penance of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attending Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, on-line and on-line or on television while others offer to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and the Saint Peter Square which has been visited by all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants into the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were initially to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many great theatres, such as Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a rise in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Events related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the rise of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, inhabitants of the first European country to undergo a serious epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at first signed petitions to ban the Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was furious on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced the criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronary virus epidemic.
The president of the unity of the West Bengale-Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which described them as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were triggered by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" that should be "destroyed".
Many paid newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free-access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory screening of COVID-19 and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronary artery RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests conducted in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported lethality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal valves is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Thereafter, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by vacuum catheter, or a crunch (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 through an inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test at 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency clearance from the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their RT-PCR diagnostic devices in real time from the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the former versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained unconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of tests at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only at this time did federal and local laboratories receive permission to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.U.S. commercial laboratories began the screening early in March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of national COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed national COVID-19 tests on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform about 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency authorisation (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an US FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using nucleic acid isotherm amplification technology instead of CRP.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is developing in Taiwan, hoping it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A literature study of March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays present a low diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive before symptoms appear."
Typical symptoms visible on the TDM include multi-lobary bilateral depolitic glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Sub-pleural predominance, "crazy Paving" and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the CDT in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the CDT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, several of its imaging results coincided with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "DM is not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, CDCs recommend PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and in the context of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (LCT) or by test at the patient's head (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the CTB, only one sample of peripheral blood is generally used, although serial samples may be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, only one sample of blood is generally taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody testing tests.
At 7 April 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.End March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics have received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibodies test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients crack inside, refer it back and receive the result of the test later.British NHS announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 test drive for suspicious cases, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
Drive centres have enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians declared on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 outpatient tests a day, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that in the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to the 12/2020 inclusive week and that 33,491 samples (6.9 %) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a methodology for the analysis of samples of 64 patients at once, by grouping the samples and only testing if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improvised 2000-square-metre emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: "eye" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of 4 March 2020, total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1, 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid manipulator robots.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes in order to continue the screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been achieved through a combination of the ability to drive tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for the manufacture of low-income kits that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as a better way of slowing down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in U.S. private laboratories, and reserves of spent chemical hatcheries and reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC test kits presented "deficiency". The government then eliminated bureaucratic barriers that hampered private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to properly use the kits.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will remove the kits that have failed results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have produced false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits that have turned out to be defective in China.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by forty of those who achieved a positive result and the tracing of people who had been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death related to the COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests for the entire population of about 3,400 people, at about ten days of interval.
Nearly half of the people who achieved a positive result did not show symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of displacement in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools have reopened at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that have performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmatory tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that proves that people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Washing of hands, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, fat, micro-organisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal means.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day: before and after disinfection, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing her layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you do not have any water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after being bitten or coughed/shrinked;
after having touched an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary artery disease and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during births at home.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory disease and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soapwashing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
Action to promote hand-washing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying low-income regions with drinking water.
Washing your hands in soap allows you to reduce diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRAs). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under the age of five, which is nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by almost half the deaths due to diarrhea and by one quarter the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Washing of hands is generally associated with other sanitary measures in water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent handwashing may damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too common hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (CTO).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (mitigation, disinfection), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, in particular before and after treating a cut or injury, after you have wiped, coughed or bitten, after you have touched animal waste or handled animals and after you have touched waste.
In many countries, the rate of soap hands cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 with 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study carried out in 2014 showed that in Saudi Arabia the rate was highest (97 per cent), the United States was in the middle of the table (77 per cent) and China had the lowest rate (23 per cent). Today there are several methods for changing behaviours and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In particular, it is possible to offer schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day to make this practice a habit.
For example, the Department of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "primary health care program" to promote the health and education of children.
The deparasitation twice a year, associated with the daily washing of the hands of soap and the daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the micro-organisms present on the skin, we need to add soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil matter, are difficult to solve in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that “the automatic liquid soap dispensers are preferable”.
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water did not help to reduce microbial burden on hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (commonly called hydro-alcoholic solutions, anti-septic solutions for hands or disinfectants for hands) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be compared for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, moss or gel dries.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than the use of hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The alcohol effect can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients resulted in significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis made them more attractive than the washing of hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic substances present in their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, since they remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, rather using ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Furthermore, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of diseases rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper washing of hands to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The friction action creates friction, which helps eliminate the germs from the skin, and rub longer removes more germs.
Rinse plenty of running water.
Washing in a stagnant watershed can lead to the recontamination of hands.
Dry with a clean or outdoor towel.
Wet and wet hands are recoupling more easily.The most often forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, finger-toe spaces and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nail and square nail varnish can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drought promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, draining water from a canon or gourd suspended and pierced and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "typy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended hook using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand-drying is an essential part of the hand-hygienic process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Fabric Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air-dryers and more modern air jet-dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air dry hands, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the thumbs and 254% on the palms.
Drying in air-jet hands resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the thumbs and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was cross-contamination potential with other toilet users and the toilet environment based on each drying method.
The air jet-dryer, which blows from the air outside the apparatus at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel the micro-organisms from the hand and the device and eventually contaminate other toilet users as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows micro-organisms to be disseminated at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dry-hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
Following the drying of hands, the following changes in bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant cloths is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands in the medical environment became mandatory well after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in the hospital.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical washing of hands should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to bite and rub each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to stay on hand, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel shall be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents hands from reconnecting to surface contact.
The objective of hand-washing in health structures is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand-cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing hands properly and following other simple procedures may reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify the hygiene of the hands if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Indications" for Hand Hygiene:
after exposure to blood/to a biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After contact with the patient, adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (we have "medicial" or "antimicrobial" soap) provides the handwashing agent with an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "frotter" their hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a wash product based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry their hands after being washed, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsed, water on the forearms must be prevented from flowing to the hands.
Once your hands have been washed, you need to dry your hands using a sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand-washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the hand-washing frequency beyond 35%.
Comparing handwashing with ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution and handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, it is observed that the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores that are difficult in hand. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care institutions, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand-washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to it and to send written and verbal reminders to it.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap-washing is considered to be a inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health or even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash your hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build handwashing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-washing and raising awareness can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of this practice and lead to a long-term change in behaviour within the population.
To achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies has shown that local approaches are effective in increasing the hand-washing rate in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hand-washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "Third Star Approach " which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules, can be cited.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote the hygiene of the hands that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Day of Handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote behavioural developments.Following the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
Few studies examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of hand-hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing care".
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fetid odors called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand-washing techniques" were placed next to the sinks in the public toilets and in the toilets of office and airport buildings.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
It came from a Bible verse from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, by Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in a compulsively manner to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbolizing her bad conscience in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been noted that some people, after having remembered or considered acts contrary to ethics, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to value hand-washing devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the hand-washing rituals put forward in many religions, including babaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls at Work
COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronary heart disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace vary according to the workplace and the tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, severity of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower risk of exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label and maintenance of routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Jobs at risk of average exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density working environments and certain large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protective equipment in the event of a meeting with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, moving to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means to acquire them (e.g., to race out of the rush hours or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the dispatch of items from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the necessary controls to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemics.
Plans to prepare and respond to infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of responding to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at the highest risk of medical complications, maintaining trade operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a comprehensive framework used in health and safety at work to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and individual protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolation of employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour; they can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (IPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the worker's risk, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced according to the needs, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower exposure-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic measures to prevent recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and thorough handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose to cough and sneeze, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for telework or working hours when necessary, dissuasive workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fevers or other symptom-related medicines. They also advise that they apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and inform the employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of average exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk may include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for the customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings in person by means of virtual communications, the setting up of working hours, the introduction of working hours, the introduction of working hours, the use of non-essential travel to areas with high risk of active VOCID-19, the development of emergency communications plans, including a forum to respond to concerns of workers, the provision of information and training facilities for workers, which have an up-to-date training on safety and safety risk factors and safety risk COVID-19
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the patient from the other by a distance of 6 feet, to appoint a crew member to take care of the patient and to offer a protective mask to the patient or to ask him to cover his mouth and nose using handkerchiefs when he or she coughs or vanishes.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the patient is suffering from fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the risk controls shall include the carry-over of the journey in case of illness and the immediate isolation and information of the medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare, the CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choral courses or meals at the canteen, increasing the space between offices, step up the hours of arrival and exit, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be envisaged. For law enforcement that perform daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Order forces officers who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use using a household washing or spray and follow the standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPEs, as well as for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers as belonging to high or very high exposure categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become highly exposed workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or samples or manipulations of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental tests and procedures or invasive sampling.
High risk of exposure funerary jobs include workers involved in the preparation of human bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when performing procedures producing aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering separate waiting rooms be separated according to the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 approved NIOSH or higher respiratory masks should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better worker comfort. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO only recommends the wearing of a surgical mask by screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a patient COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, the use of PPE required for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECT: [Covid-19] Reduce the load and prepare the future
Date/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:00 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and of the responsibilities that we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of global community empathy, cooperation and strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendliness and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone showed me his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia right now, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play, we will make consistent adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we have considered what we believe would be a suitable response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
All staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be approximately 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week to new order.
We do not declare holidays: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at present, and if you need to take care of your relatives, race or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should go hand in hand, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply prevent your superior and help your team revise time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed with the COVID-19, please warn Bryan from the T&amp;C department to help you and make sure your situation gets the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities towards our subcontractors and our fellow members of the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his usual working hours under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of overcoming their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what we are expecting and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Trust &amp; Security and Funding Teams (among others) perform essential work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to catch up with the wasted time" when the pandemic will pass.
We will not ask you to do overtime to comply with now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new targets and timetables as appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt ourselves to our new reality and to our daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the schedule for delivering our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan which provides for more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, in excess of caution, we called on an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which has shared with us and with all the staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our usual colleagues in remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to meetings of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distributing them over several days.
Define the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an electronic mail to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remotes channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of a delay or modification of those objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad in the face of the upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the next, the CRT is working on creating a page on Méta-Wiki to provide a space so that the community can monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This applies to all of us and we are here to help you in any way.
By this time, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is to recognize that at present, our work and our obligations will likely have to adapt in an unprecedented manner.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us at the time.
For now, it is time to assist and prepare for important work that will occur in the weeks and perhaps in the months ahead.
We need each one of you to achieve it, which is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself at the right time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7), which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of terminating N peptidease and a domain of co-convesting renal amino acid with terminating C.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, with the enzyme-active domain being exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane primarily to cells of type II lung alveoles, enterocytes of the cervix, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and blood cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACNm of the ACE2 is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE cleps the angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 clemates amino acid phenylamine with carboxyle termination of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also split several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensine, dynorphine A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that originated with SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that originated with COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by host serum protein TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continued standard treatment using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who have a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those who are victims of stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The conversion enzyme of human recombinant angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is presented as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes more than the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who tolerate classical renal-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 under infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronary virus pandemic, i.e. identification of people (“contacts”) who may be contacted with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application named TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application to track the exposure to potentially infected people and to communicate quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking application of contacts was at an advanced development stage and could be deployed over the next few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to set up applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a management application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of applications-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add conavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Activists in the protection of privacy have expressed concerns about the implications of coronary-virus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to address the coronary-virus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and monitoring should include termination clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives;
data security and anonymity should be clearly protected;
digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Provision should be made for protection against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse;
the "significant participation" of all "stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network trace was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, all central server-based systems do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, thus respecting privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made localization information accessible to the public, which was authorized following profound changes in the privacy laws of the information after the MERS epidemic affected that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralised systems that preserve privacy.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralised protocols encompass Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TNC, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all correspondence is made on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab currently develops SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies originally based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the NCT International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would allow privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a confidential encryption.
They also published the specifications for basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official coronary artery tracking applications that respect privacy
direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, refiling, reassignment, or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of a drug approved for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was initially developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-type protease, dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribosis phosphate.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-Paludian medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Clinical Solidarity trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency authorization (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the ADF clinical trial process and is authorized under the AU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians indicated using this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School performs a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipyravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the evidence available for the drug is minor and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan for its reserves and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump to acquire the drug. The medicine can be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to reproduce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to change these drugs to find a compound that would be associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of specially developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that rerdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one covering people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on vitamin C intravenously for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The State of New York began testing the azithromycin antibiotic on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Overall Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial of Teijin's alvesco (cyclesonide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a phase II test is under way with 200 patients to be recruited among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have passed clinical tests, many development attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that caused the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic occurred around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms conducted research and development projects early in 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets in phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As stated by ECPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (presumed in the course of planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres at all, determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese disease control and prevention centre on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it worked on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, indicated developing a coronavirus-like particle through the partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is being researched in the laboratory, with human tests being planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that American President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large sum of money to benefit from exclusive access to the Vaccine against the COVID-19", which prompted the German government's protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a RNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 RNA-based vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its candidate final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, thus bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$ 29 million.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 to be developing a self-ampplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on counter-medical measures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C dedicated to the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to create a national "Vaccine Bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronary heart disease occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, claiming that "subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro needles triggered an important response of specific antibodies to the antigen [see mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-based IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized test in Australia is planned to include 4,170 health professionals.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against SARS.
When the SARS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could be used as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA based) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were viral, two were adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus at the origin of the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by different social network publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronary virus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and exhaustion.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throatache, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can range between two and fourteen days.
While most cases generate moderate symptoms, some develop towards viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly in proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Since these droplets are produced at expiration, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then by touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the actual polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations on wearing masks by the public in general vary, some authorities recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others still imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, suffocation.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent pain or thoracic pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and a face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as eternation, nasal flow or throat pain may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people developing symptoms will do so within 11.5 days after infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
Talking loudly frees more drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bio-aerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient rooms produced positive samples to the viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may dissipate respiratory secretions and thus lead to air spread.
Although there are concerns about a spread through the saddles, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, one person generally infected two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if properly used; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, thus disabling it and removing the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after initiation of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three patients with pneumonia related to Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the II-type alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries have been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial lesions may also be related to the receptors of the ACE 2 in the heart.
The ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients with intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with adverse prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 showed widespread alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, secretive T cells of GM-CSF were associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported to autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks' intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerization reaction tests (CPR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (possible to detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were under development, but not widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test as close to the patient as possible on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobed bilateral depolitic glass opacityes with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Plenty under crying, crazi Paving (interlobular septal thickening with completely variable alveolar) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of the COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia undergoing healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavity and interstitial lung fibrosis
Blood: diffused intravascular coagulation (CIVD) ; leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering its mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hygiene of the hands after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering its face using a fabric in public places to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by stopping schools and workplaces, reducing travel and canceling large groups of people.
The distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "coupling the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having eaten, coughed, or wiped.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO proposes two formulae for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, which is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as wetting.
People are treated with support care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support from other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Revival and pneumologist doctors in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, in particular in conditions of care where procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals who suffer from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation chamber suitable for airborne infection (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of individual protective equipment (IPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (to facial masks) are preferred.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protective screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not sufficiently severe to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal canal or positive pressure of double-level respiratory tract.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to hold to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal. Serious cases are more frequent in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, thus limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high PEEP are necessary to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatment to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being tested.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several medicines in the course of testing are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalescent people as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It was not submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their names and an identifier.
The application is capable of detecting "near contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detecting a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-forty, it also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel enabled security agencies to locate mobile phone data for persons suspected of having the coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020 Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect forty.
In Italy, the regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile telephone operators that "40% of people continue to move."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have moderate changes with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment being observed in 4% of those in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of them being hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples present a diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathetic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung looks like an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high troponin rates or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing diseases. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-numbering of moderate cases can lead to over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a 2.4 times higher risk of going into intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns were also found regarding the long-term sequelae of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital administration has seen a 20 to 30% decrease in respiratory capacity in some patients who are cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to post- intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity for people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of individuals cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronaryvirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an worsening of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by propagation of infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only caused by a transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest symptom onset date was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, therapeutic options, time from the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has assigned emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory confirmed deaths in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for case deaths of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time period.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global death/home ratio is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Mortality is higher among humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest among 50-year-old men, the difference between men and women disappearing only at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent in men and 1.7 per cent in women.
The precise reasons for this difference between genders are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of them.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nursing staff, are women and have an increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Coronavirus" from Wuhan.
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of 2019-nCov provisional disease names and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as razors and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in due course, a local startup retroconverted and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "Solidarity test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on S-protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccine-creating technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a virus-related harmless genetic code that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
Seven trials evaluated already approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine and drug candidates against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassion-based redesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of physicians treating patients of COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial-slice protein starting with serum transmembrane protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE receptor 2.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is in the process of nationally unrandomized phase 2 test in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected of causing the death of certain affected persons.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokines refractory to steroid relay syndrome induced by a different cause, treatment with CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by Immune Systems of People Healing from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccinational method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of serum of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
