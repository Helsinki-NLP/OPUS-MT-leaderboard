Right populist triumph in Austria, together they form 29%
The pre-elections to the Austrian parliament have resulted in the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the right populist.
Strong and special losses have suffered the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously slammed.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national policy.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of votes, thus losing 5.5 per cent of votes compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
Even in early July, when the PVO left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party's president and, to date, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this Monday could already be achieved at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and approximate starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties to the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the populars negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this clearly bet Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to cooperate with any party and who has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and has fallen from the third to the fifth position among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the limit of four percent and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles, then a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be achieved, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
So stated the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organised on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was free of charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter rests.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," said the Czech Head of Diplomaty.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person a "legally competent support", said the Indian minister.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he only found.
A Czech Arbitrates a Fight in the Seabed
I am approaching an electronic wall map, in which Australia is represented surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it also the seabed surrounding it.
At the same time, the region is as large as a single continent," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His head, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and, sometimes, complete it.
It governs this workshop and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed still hides a world little known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms so far have the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the land
The coastal countries have today begun to compete vehemently in the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially the so-called continental border, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply, continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the 200 sea miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external limits of the Border Continent must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of job preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert aid commission.
The commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact since it was the first that essentially expanded its marine domain.
However, New Zealand also achieved it - the surface of the seabed that gave it the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pain in their study.
The profit that will be released from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also presenting little by little their requests.
They can do so until 10 years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Right here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says the director Mikulka with emphasis adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to exploit in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The background there is damaged, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A surface of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee from the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of realization.
It reminds us of a small potato or a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the German special forces command was at the place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More and more details are available on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, at the scene of liberation were the German army specialists as well as GSG 9 officers, the federal police aircraft squad, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, also the experts in the field of logistics of the technical welfare institution.
As the spokespersons of the ministries reported on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as a support on the spot.
"Thank God he didn't arrive at that moment," said a spokesperson from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, the raiders had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to another in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the care of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed with very little a large saving package of $700 billion for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell so drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the government's package to save financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, it did not reach a majority for the programme with which disorder should be limited in financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to take a vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause for this was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the next few months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation the desire to travel the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison to the same period last year.
According to the research conducted by the GfK Market Research Institute, reservations for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel and computing agencies approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar above all travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The Germans' favorite destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also Germany's regions.
Most of the organized trips are very preferred, says Klaus Laepple, the president of the Drv.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, dropped.
My first Octoberfest
The party hits under the open sky at the endless spa, beer in jars of one liter and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut at a campaign shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit.
I have dark-colored hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in the campaign store, the photographers have rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very flattering above all because I'm first in Octoberfest.
That's how you get friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist in the Okotfest from northern Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so long.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; no one seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my frontal gets rare glances next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention to my frontal dress in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side it is compromised, behind it is a widow."
Oh, God, now I'm hanging behind the left.
"All right," he says laughing.
The others do not care about many subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves as an exhibitionist is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in the Oktoberfest.
It seems to him "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
You tell me after you put your glass of a litre of beer next to you that you just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most of them think that's a garbage cube.
So Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the evening, health groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear in groups every time - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered streets from one campaign shop to the other.
That works like with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You don't see who's suffering from alcoholemia and is on the street.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore," gave me the answer by answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey decided to become a member of the European Union, the European powers encouraged the desire to penetrate the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides say.
The building is set to hortigate the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone's dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decaying.
But once you passed the vault, there is no doubt what the size of the company was that this was the western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has collapsed and remained outside history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping centers built and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suit - men and women - meet at first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Wear, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look both east and west at the same time.
It's not a case if it's not for each other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "Could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replied, "does not want to confront that choice."
He then stressed a point that almost everyone I've talked to so far had recited to me almost in memory: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to the East of Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would it have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, to a large extent, would be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man in Europe."
So there is not much doubt in which continent this fascinating country will have to claim.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (which 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for children under 21, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, several of us were finishing at the age of 20 - we only refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it Madrid or Messiaen, regardless of whether not accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this chorus of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and to the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
That's the only way to sing!"
His variet was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too flowery.
Whoever was the musical screen, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I have never, by any means, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of immensity and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sell one or two well-known war horses around the world."
We'll miss it a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) he states that "in 1946 the studies of economic history were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a degree, one master's and one doctor's degree."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not totally correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship in Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew attention to me because of their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's Supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolum presents an even wider interior space.
All of this is added to refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolum are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
Before analysing the new model, however, it is necessary to comment that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
It is precisely in Japan that about a million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 jazz units since 2002, which accounts for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary's officials expect to sell 2,000 jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to make much of the decrease in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which means 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Also, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - which the Japanese company expects to market around 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Business Launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width is up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is kept at 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, inner habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the former Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are from the engine 1.4 version, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1,2 and 1,4 litres gasoline thrusters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic obtains a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm to 4,900 turns.
This propeller - which previously reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now has 100.
This 100 horse Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee coche' that prevents collisions
To advance in the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Safety Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is bee's compound eyes, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within 180-degree radius in front of BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an approach microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
"At the moment you detect an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a straight angle or larger to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and slowing down, so that the little robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require to store information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology that Nissan vaccine will introduce into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Frightened before hypothesized
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a fun and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Bad Credit Hotel'... or the mess.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, he has useful information, but little detail.
It's more a page for teenagers than a site for all the audience.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something's something, because from buying a better house or talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursed $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock exchange contribution.
One week after an interim agreement was discovered, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 % of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a price per unit of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion extra dollars with the purchase of convertible securities which will guarantee you a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of $29, i.e. 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley had lost 6,79 per cent to $23,07 each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the larger names of Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the benefit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold with more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG-contributing capital will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson from the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have greatly relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its contribution in the stock exchange go down to half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost went back on Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the large Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcys of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, was the third to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7 % were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to obtain half the plus one suffrage.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the electoral centres and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes", estimated from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed in a crushing manner " , he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
So Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by her Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points consolidating the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving the " development planning " of a country that essentially lives through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies that send their emigrants.
With the exception of Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, which may carry out up to two consecutive mandates of four years each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa had already announced that she would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane to the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to the international airport of Cairo.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They find themselves healthy" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian tourism minister Zohair Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell in possession of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in allterrestrials in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one safari to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the travel agency Egyptus, in charge of the organisation of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault at night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and killed half the kidnappers, the others have fled," said this responsible who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commanders.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"It must be acknowledged that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrestrial on board which were the kidnappers, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Nations Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement that was immediately denied by that group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture takes place in the headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But one sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical places that starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros to restore only Chinon’s castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this in consultation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of history societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 Benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money lots of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is it a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with nationalisation the Belgian-Netherlands bank Fortis which is in trouble due to the impact of the mortgage crisis of the US market: the three countries will support in total EUR 11.2 billion to this financial and insurance institution which also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the Head of Economic Competition of the European Commission.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions made with regard to the Bank can in some sense be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early morning of Sunday, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including most of the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year of ABN Amró Dutch.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong decrease last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with their 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company's actions only on Friday decreased by 12 percent, this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
By observing the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital on the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's leadership imposed the sudden fall of Fortis' actions on the insecurity of the US market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the actions already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already said that investors had nothing to worry about, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s customers so far there was no panic, they did not invade bank offices to withdraw their money.
El Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the hen
In the United States, life and health insurance companies when they see drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which are linked to the use of the recipe data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if we don't, "let's trust the fox chicken" - quote the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation for the customer’s health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They first sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the client identification number easily obtains the list of medicines purchased in the last year and half and the program itself draws the conclusion on the customer's diseases and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is almost incurablely high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate numerous versions of the programme, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve to treat both headache and heat waves and even antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which before purchasing the necessary information from the pharmacies, require the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already obliging them to this, although they have not been fined for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and have been combined with the data on drug use and obtain more accurate information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and it is becoming more and more difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and health providers.
The bill providing authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the supply of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny its approval, because if the insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, however, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this issue in addition to the other global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
Today there will also be a Franco-Indian summit to deal mainly with nuclear energy cooperation.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit initiated yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Senior Representative for Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase to over 100 billion euros, their trade.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions existing with India, so also air transport may fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only 9th among the EU's trading partners.
The summit paid its attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and rushed the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both parties have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, that is to say, by 2020 it wants to reduce pollution emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, as in the climate conference next year, a global agreement should be reached and by 2050 the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 per cent.
They also wished to impede the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that the French companies will receive charges worth EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the international exhibition of Frankfurt's book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the sample with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro representing the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting will follow with the print at the Room Struktur in Buchmesse’s 5.0 pavilion: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of editorials in Italy.
According to data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total of Italian production, particularly for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 as he flew over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on an altitude of 3,000 metres above ground, in the area of the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has cleared the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is the very same thing that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" said at a print conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or around.
The millionaire, 63, has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of investigators has been sent that identified the apparatus: it is owned by Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of primitives.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world's turn on a plane and without scales.
Among its record, that also for flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the trucks all land "compact" of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Own by the content outside of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the Glk suv, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Next, through the use of the innovative lighting technology8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Other Italy" group that has been following for years the Italian National and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Trivenet.
De Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (the times units, in fact) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night have been removed so that they are not identified.
British fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, the Levski ones.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the party: all with names, therefore easily controlled.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what they had gone out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those from across Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium.
Luckily!
But now is the fear of imitation: let those few fifty add others.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why, "well-open eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, that is, the secret service, which deals with the problems in stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the raised arm during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is Domenico Mazzilli's (unhappyly expressed) thought, for a few weeks now the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that he was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not do the sociologist – adds the No.1 of the Observatory – the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the event happens.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the silvos at Mameli's anthem: these too are not a crime, but if they don't allow them to be educated...".
