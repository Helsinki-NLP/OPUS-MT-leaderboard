Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the excarceration of the minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic offences in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of a disadvantaged agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the appeal court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
226 votes were required for adoption.
The victory of Libya
The story of Libyan liberation, or of Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be defined who the winner is
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is about deluding whether it is moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already be forgotten to be emancipated and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot and cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably was not suitable for the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted the help of unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that NATO's attacks did not lead them to an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness was celebrated after each successful intervention.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the premises do not pose a problem of expelling the "crosss"
But without occupation will the oil tankers get made of Libyan black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible not to, but it may be that finally the West can presume to protect human rights.
As long as the sharia followers don't cross us.
Starts a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for investors
A statistical turbulence has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-four-monthly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only set in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of Eurozone, Germany, Czechia and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, Germany has improved more than expected (by 0.3% rather than by 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-four-monthly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSU, the trend towards gradual slowdown in growth of economic development is consistent.
The results are even worse than analyst forecasts.
Main events:
In the course of the year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% on an annual basis.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the ten-year Czech bonds remain at 4 per cent, although the situation is worsening in the area.
In Germany, voices are raised saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium 200 million.
The football team performs the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiraček, victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, stood up fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship date.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good luck dose in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the hero Jiraček, won for 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defence, the Montenegrin did not press until the second half.
The two injured were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let go of two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the quote of the European Cup, so the national football vessels will get an estimated 200 million kroner gratification.
A good offensive game has already been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams focused only on maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks to the other defense camp, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for your country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying on Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then coerced death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahán human shields around the nuclear technology center in which they work with uranium.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend your country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to achieve nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at noon at Isfahan's nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahán power plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and dinner stuffed
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and 5 per cent obesity.
Obese children come in most families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as is the case with current research.
It is demonstrated again the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, by bottling at least twice as often as children of normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children there is no habit of sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same nearly 900 basic education children from all over Czechia.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A proper diet and quite exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obesity children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, merrienda and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with ink for dinner
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In Czechia, however, only 23 per cent of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10 percent of the homes there is no breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children are much more often consumed by the sick potato fries.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet drinks (70%).
In general, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed do sport, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled selected boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age, from a healthy diet point of view, are far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet drinks is particularly alarming," the final report of the study warns.
As the main food is carried the pasta and follows closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence," in many cases a significant change was made in favour of the principles of healthy diet," points to the results of the study.
Call attention, for example, to the matter of sweet drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and common water.
Children would also choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a threader.
We've been studying with the director, Alena, (in the course there's no man) about how to dress the woman who doesn't have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The designer must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer López, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not wearing it in a too challenging way
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth making at least one piece of extra fabric tailored.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothing they feel perfectly is priceless.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or flags.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the task assigned, I already have more than anything else.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to whom he must design two garments: one for the day and one for the night.
We must take into account the current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've been "dressed" to Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry inside, it is much better for me than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened about a hundred kilos (please take into account overexaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to trim them from magazines or search them online and print them, and then process them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as it is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The designer, therefore, did not see only physically, but also dealt with, for example, product pages in magazines (specific topics, such as trends, pockets, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us all about this.
But all this is already left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all types of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to break this off.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with cowboys and T-shirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or it's enough to boot it up and up the neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, which is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reservation he wants to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition, the photos work in combination with other garments, all of which are different from those used in reality.
All this needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Chechnya, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (I have enough of my skills, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a very different size to their real (less) size.
Then it just hangs and finds out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has become fat/stricken, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the designer is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you must mainly communicate with the people you have seen, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her dress and complete it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw everything he had and say, "I know what a horror"."
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so that someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, chitapeluses, or indispensable. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the session of photos of products such as bags or hats), special tweezers in front of them, if it was bigger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the soles of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the exterior.
And we did nothing but cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me joy by praising my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't really get these skills very well.
This is just a small part of all we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to professional stylism is not a pink road, but I don't care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but that was useless if, in fact, nothing was intended to be done.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added, aroused great expectations before its premiere.
I promised that I would give new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, after shown, appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again without more.
We also feel curious about how the scenes would stay inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results don't vary much about what we expected.
There are careers that can be made acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd errors, which have already appeared in the series for years.
Indeed, mistakes cannot be called, but rather, they are the incomprehensible release of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not feel remotely that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing from the other world.
But the stroll through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, racing is sometimes diversified by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance to a number of required rivals (the normal thing in a classic race), then try to earn time (the classic timed duel) and then wait a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this, sometimes the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite less landscapes in the game of what could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the tracks of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a great thing, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a career designed with a lot of action is quite convenient for this driving style, although we can find something better between competition games.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a while.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games like this you can't expect to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, which isn't everything in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocky, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making out of control.
Even it's completely destroyed.
Thanks to the resettling system, there are no great problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are scheduled in such a way that, when you suffer from an accident or get out of the track, the game will return you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the start.
So it's no more than a help in case something isn't right, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, nor does resettling help, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to go in a specific way; otherwise, you cannot take it.
Other times you will find yourself in some "civil" vehicle site always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth, or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This causes anger especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances smoothly, but when you arrive, you must either turn around or stop.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed that the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nose.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, without taking into account the time, you will always advance the same opponent on the same site.
This also occurs at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When you go in front of you, it makes it difficult to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car pop.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it's a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive clues or the ranking in the race so that it doesn't break the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to keep an eye on the gas dispensers next to the road, because that's exactly where you have to change cars, although in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and supersport exotics for technical driving, for example by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know through the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the upper level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog function is connected online, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race is made in history.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (passe), where you run dark through the tracks (passe).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (passe) and, suddenly, from behind you comes the subway convoy and you are carried forward without more.
In writing we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or whether the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even sovereign.
So what a pity it is that, at the most tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game were to avoid absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is assured, but prepare because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.
The choirs of the University of Carolina will participate in the concert "Students of Terciopelo".

Ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nová:
Czechs have a reputation for negativity and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war to be set up without a barracks."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation settles a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began with conviction at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take his motto "clearly and openly on Europe", which he said at the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers from the Faculty of Law of the United States of Carolina.
The work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, was also carried out by Vice-Nová:
"The first is criticism, that if it is insular, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I must say that it left everyone confused, because it assumes its roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can hear the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained on the basis of the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?". This is therefore an important step towards unifying and clarifying the political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us Olomouc's cheese
Vice-Nová has also taken care of the agenda, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czechia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good start", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which fewer? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreigners or jargies that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the cucumbers are not really invented, the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to European institutions.
Europe of speed is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is for many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and I get approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman beside me says to me, "What, have you already remained, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is seen that he doesn't have any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is awaiting new tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries you want and those you don't, that you stay out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vice-Nova is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Chechnya and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed between the Member States, not only between the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that would define the IBM strategy very precisely, the approximate one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already been 100 years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-lasting character was put by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano during his birthday.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees such as the manager of Ba in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first U.S. workers to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in relation to the customer.
Already from the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without any problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, so Palmisano will replace it next year: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been the head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, rain of online ideas, of which there are countless future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that ideas arise, because nearly half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained an institution concept rather than a technological company," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," points out George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering into the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the United States familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world for the past 100 years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (developments both equipment, programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the highest number of patents from all US technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the automatic cashier, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and diskettes.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied customers' taste and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on progress, you cannot anchor yourself emotionally in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and likewise, if they don't work, they leave them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programme and another fifth equipment.
However, in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier's share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets of a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that up to now IBM has been able to tackle the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not ceased to increase.
The currency of IBM is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally it was a brand used at the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM emerged from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions like the famous "fix clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint put the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years of Watson’s management of the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the large expansion of the company across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have been improved, for example in terms of transport and city management.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also his lover, Darina continued to hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and have established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové in her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after ★íčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
She even publicly declared that she loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even dismissed him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with her arms open.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw it away."
"But here I would live not as my dear and old drunk who was wrong, but as a man to whom I join certain bonds," Rychtářová said and added that he had already torn off his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't care that the woman has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set this up as a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I shop."
"Darina and I talk normally, all we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová finds a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, neither where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If I ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where are some female vices cited that can cause men to boil blood?
Go to Shopping
Does he blame his orange half who is dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trapet a week?
Do you like to buy often in discountes?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more through the clothes shops, look for properly adjusted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women going shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that you better wait for her in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"You'd need to slow down at least five kilos - should you start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
Oh, yeah?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It is not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your partner complain all the time about his physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning first
He's like an infinite tiovative.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, wash the floor, remove the dust, wash the bath and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have dirty a freshly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that so hard to clean?
In case you suffer this "detour", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleaning could threaten your family relationships and well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"The pants used are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those socks tomorrow too."
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If he makes these cometaries to his partner more times a day, he knows he'll get it out of his boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slanders and sparks
Some women also have slanders, gossips, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
Perhaps each one of us gets away with a small, harmless schism.
With the hand in the heart, this is owned by almost all women.
On the other hand, there are funny women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do so, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female working team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey front Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina's field and put the Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star play, and took another step and was declared a better player of the game.
Two attendances were awarded in the party and Jágr’s companion Jakub Voraček.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to the overseas journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party I had told him I'd make triplet."
"I was introducing him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first flyers hit.
A while later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trail.
Voraček was made with the disc behind the Hurrican gate and moved it between the circles up to Maxim Talbot, who put a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he entered the third goal, after his shot crashed through Wayne Simmonds's fourth-placement.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the best three," Jágr put his center.
"It would never have happened to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalti, to get to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they were outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to tie him to the record and I'm glad I got it," Voraček described the last goal of the party as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has led the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost one player with a lot of defense experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were new."
"Finally, but nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotation of players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave blank," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The goals of Jets were marked by five players who ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, as the trips to the West were very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after that the Yugoslav regime was inclined west and the journeys of Czech tourists were then rather restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Slovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually, not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to go to the queue with a sleeping bag and spend all night, or have "good-known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for trips to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable agent", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This habit still persists.
The way Czechs travel has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the no longer going to spend holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that Croatia, until 1989, was unable to travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, the visa exemption was imposed to travel to Western European neighbouring States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czech-Slovaks, for a long time, didn't see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, since our incomes at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to carry with them the food (conservatives, stuffed, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversionability of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it average wages, which led to an increase in travel demand around 1997.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began to prepare trips on a regular basis from 1997 onwards using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volumes.
By the end of the 90th century, Czechs were already travelling visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chechnya to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have started every year, making countries far away and warm. This winter will be flying directly from Czechia to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting around 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, so our country became one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been spent on trips abroad more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses on the stay site.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in a dead end.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without the same, you cannot even vote to choose from among the three candidates.
Interested in chairing the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, not before calling his colleagues to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evidenced on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní d ęm), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only about the method of choice.
No consensus was reached on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be removed by the Executive Committee, which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times now, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who, from the management of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, he will win that candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will apply.
The Moravia Region is prepared to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemia part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would take away, however, the meaning to the two previous rounds and deny completely the concept of bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With this, surprisingly, it also agrees with Tomaš Paclík, although the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"To avoid inventing any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who for the first time applied as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All the passions will calm down with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"Soccer will be the protagonist again, and so will cooperate more gladly," said the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not about the conflict between bohemians and morals, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope the common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all sides to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport away from the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, as they say, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the Chief of Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be nominated as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I'd be fighting for her and I wouldn't run for election."
"But to this day no such person has been found," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Pacík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) presidency.
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when he would arrive the turn of the ordinary general assembly.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I could take into account."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," she adds.
What is supposed to be most disturbing to Paclík right now is Pelta's relationship with Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association President, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates' vote at the general assembly.
For Pacík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With Berbra's support, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone call during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta was impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta became president."
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Pacík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I don't put my noses where I don't feel able," added Paclík, who in September raised a lot of attention to support the suspension of the Committee of Refers chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclic admits that you would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities for private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, held the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to your safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," said Paclík without hiding his antipathies to the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be devoted."
"If you increase the taxes on gambling, as announced by the political parties, you would support your arguments, but frankly you have to tell us where this money is going to stop," he says.
Furthermore, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in yielding hypocritically my actions of the Pilsen Club to another person and then coming back there after a year and a half," said Pacík.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the deathdate of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he was elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve future electoral dispute.
The representative of Jablnek is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections that were not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of election, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to take part in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could help him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels are taking care of football a long time ago and expect to meet the new President on Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," warned Pelta.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign to win delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond if this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
He had already warned in the past that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his legal training, knowing that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not let puppeteer with his head.
"It's been more than a year in the football world, and it's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," said their opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lower competitions to the higher.
The latter should be a football promotion window.
"Like this, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," said 46-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that lie ahead of the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk this Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in its career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FAČR would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected as new President of the Czech Football Association in the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be disappointed.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemian case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself to football completely."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers."
"I don't mean to say that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, carry on with great momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself again as a candidate.
"They all know, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he explained.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then the others would be defeated too."
"It's about having faith not to give up like that, no more," he said.
They say that it also motivates him to continue his work with Hašek.
"During those two years, a great deal of work has been completed that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have begun and will have their effect within a couple of years and I don't want anyone to stop them," he announced concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the time of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that it would be only Bohemian the President.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we only have three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, was joined in the battle of presidential elections, Rajchl still believes in his ability to be elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include the saving of some tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, the negotiations on television contracts and the negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event of his election, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staff staff in the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he thus evaluates his Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made an investigation trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in his luggage, a bather.
He looked back on the water, looked at the dome at the top, swam towards the marble angels, who waited for her at the edge of the pool and amazed at the modernist indoor pool restored meticulously.
He liked the bathroom, took note of his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathroom palaces in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the culture of the bathroom.
He doesn't want anything to do with sport, says Meder, only the water is different.
It only bothers you that the fans of the bathroom have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine stinks, while the fans of running can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful bird tribes in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The hat in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The well-being factor in the swimming pools is so great because all senses are being cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor swimming pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms there is a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the coloured tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, above all, it is eager to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the highlights in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old bathroom of Széchenyi in Budapest, there are nitrated waters in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city has eyes in the roofed pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps most extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an ovni that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steams in winter, while at the bottom the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur, in the baths of Arpad in Békescsaba, Hungary, gas oil plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo stick to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbathing in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he found a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demolished windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decline was opposite in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can neo-Romanic elements of the times of their construction be discovered in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its stunning modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a great merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the consortium leader wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not consider it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock market bets raise prices, and banks bear the responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer campaign specifically addresses Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, betting on raw materials was intended to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have declined from offers and demands, and earn from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deems to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Bings at rising food prices show especially drastic how ruthless banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio where it puts money into play for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the consortium leader wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than planned on the board.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to barely care about possible losses, that's what his successor will deal with.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were betted.
Many bank clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage a bank like that from its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, cancel its account and change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Pavilion Transferred
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high heights and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
Now it reopens as a house of exhibitions.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate, clear shapes, crystal halls, brave curves and new construction materials, typical of the technical progress thinking, so the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is an appropriate and well known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture to date.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, rose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South Station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated inside.
The building was suitable but lacked adequate spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, was inaugurated a coup of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, art skater on ice in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, carried out reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation should be exhibited, there should be a café and a bookstore and also a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only did Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna substantially reform, he enlarged it and was helped by the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
It was aware of the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass façade windows was changed, an insulated glass fiber reinforced glass crystal was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and asbestos ceilings rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old caoba shades and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the way it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "random appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awake the proper consciousness."
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a hit of urban luck. The totally new and planned "Central Station Quarter", with houses and offices, is next to Schweizer Garten.
And there may be another lucky blow: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city over a nearby place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that reaches millions
The company has designed a crisis plan, which would avoid the failures of the trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What it costs millions.
In the fight against the failures and delays of the trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments up to 2005 of around EUR 300 million.
For what needs to be achieved a better availability of vehicles and the rail network even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double domestic and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and from the Andeans.
The aim is to clean up the snow and ice runs and 90 percent of the needles required for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, inter alia, he lacked reservations about adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for permission from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of the high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train was broken by an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the U.S.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCA financial market regulator criminalizes many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesperson from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the NCA, held the deferral of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit cooperatives and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect client investments.
The NCA seeks to reintegrate the losses of millions originating.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other major banks and in summer filed disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgages, these are so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for American banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or to sanction errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of requests.
Reproachs the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from FHFA, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without specifying an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru, Buffett, invests forcefully in the information technology company IBM.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
It had to be understood long before IBM offered mainly services and looked for computer systems for other companies' information technology departments.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology must be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed at the CNBC economics station that has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus increased one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about engagement until now.
He commended the leadership in dealing with the regular benefits of the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established the services of Information Technology for profit such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM shares in the stock market rose by one percent.
"The blue giant", as known to IBM, has a stock market value of more than 220 billion dollars and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is reviving.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs tricked and Greek between 2001 and 2006 have a background from the far right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that was believed to have been killed long ago, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right background against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-rightist network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Do you reviv the bloody ideology?", entitled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informer of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantial.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The cohabitation was set on stage with cheerful colors, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German show "Hürriyet" does not insist on drawing this mental connection either.
"It starts to smell badly," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He noted that the assassins were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Turkish-derived German Internet forums, police behaviour and its subsequent success in the search are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought suspects in the ultra-right circle long before.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on it is lost, immigrants are left only self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of sanctions to the whole network," writes Selen.
This means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen's fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the sense of group of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the lack of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-like attack at Solingen sent a telegram of pity to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what contributed to the taxes of the Turks of Germany.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows how profound it has since been the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words.
The Lake Zurich scandal bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into the financial crisis and since then was released from one crisis to the next.
Now a German runs it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, it was known in July that it would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the board of directors of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomes Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves friendly comments about its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and cheated 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the administrative board of the USB was considered equally touched since then, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will be in charge of the presidency of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economy and counselor and has had a period of certainly necessary adaptation.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved that he deserves the title "the biggest bank in the scandal of Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset administrator, and on the other hand, for years, it has been sliding from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the manager of discreet and solid Swiss property, but also clever, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later bank professor in Zurich for many years explains: "In front of my students, I have always rated the USB as a good bank model."
"From the current point of view, one asks, "How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on high-risk securities losses and had to depreciate billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some would look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 at the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, making it the co-ownership of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland's economic results (see graph).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly cheated taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with payment compensation.
With this, UBS confessed more or less that it had helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the discretionary aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when I was back to being somewhat quieter, just when I thought the UBS was getting it back, this unlucky operator's story happens, an individual operator cheated 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, of course, that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"With the Adobol case it is apparent that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers have long appeared, was to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine Republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich does not match the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters on Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry stores like Tiffany`s between traditional Swiss businesses as Sprüngli would confess.
Here are Swiss banks for years: from the national bank, passing through Credit Suisse palace, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, it believes, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"This Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The Fall of UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How do they do it?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the centre of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could run a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to open up steps from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel made sure of Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffle probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Destiny came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings, where Wuffli, the consortium leader, always repeated the same motto: Get off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out well for him.
In currency operations and stock trading was at the highest.
However, the company advisors in charge highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is enormous compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk US investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and sell them below, maintaining certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks sought the downhill for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," Geiger, an expert in banking.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The UBS posts have become projectable seats and are still unsafe.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, focus on property management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decrease considerably, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he was imposed: He must run the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, reported to the bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask at the moment.
So far he just says he'll first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has frightened US investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain powerless.
The slow industrial production on the continent suffocates the hopes of stabilising in its origin a crisis caused by indebtedness.
The general relief on government changes in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems go back to a foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.

What created scepticism among US investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, there are also more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
Therefore, from their point of view, it is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws on the edge a decade of old principles and enters the American technology sector.

Intelligent fats spread in cities
In many places fats are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, fats have belonged to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated because of the filth and the noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The fats no longer leave the cities, experts say in the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There experts from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end up with traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing building and the fall of trees that house them make life difficult for birds.
The fats are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, the negative press headlines jumped into a controversial project to mass-kill the ranks of the district.
Critics have described animal hunting as using bird traps and stick murder as particularly brutal.
"Expulsioning them and escaping them in a normal way is not achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting with water to nests or throwing trees is often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Ahuyentar is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, residences of elderly people or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, opinion Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of escaping animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to re-establish themselves elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a peak in the face with aplom."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the fats of Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms about the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, fats not only take advantage of resources to access skis, but also manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, researchers from Cambridge University checked four steps to the extent of bird intelligence.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a pollen larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, astute fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a pulley larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the pipe shooter.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.

The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of Englishman Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the balloon did not cross the line (33.).
Jiracek was successful for the Czech Republic
Then Wolfgang Stark College of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European Vice Champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in minute 81. with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the legionaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also got lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, doorkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own door (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the Doo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the front turn, very fair in the Czech porter.
After the rest the Czechs had to protect the wide range of the world famous porter, the front of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of the marvel of Zagreb football.

While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat of the 2002 World Bank third party, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In minute seven and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball into the porter.
After the second reaction, Croatia took over more and more.
After the break, Croatia did not let them score any goals.
Along with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, which in minute 62. took place Ivan Perisic, from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern from Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.

Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who won the 4-0 in the party ready for a previous decision, was put to the head in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) paired with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until 23rd, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the very first moment, the long-term defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in minute 32. he advanced it.

Personal level massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatist personae of the kind that can make one fall soul at his feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and convert it to your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelist story, and this dramatic personae will work as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments in which, like one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is a rare book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanists to scalators, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives flash here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a diversion from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the deadly war of trenches on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall upon the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intratable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Katrina hurricane that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's home with your children, you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmbrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and getting them to grips with what's going on.
About telling the story of a German college girl says: "Successful, everywhere else".
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into meat fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, it is observed, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care about him.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is awfully similar to "a condemned being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the livestock of the young century: The eloquent mass killer and ideologically convinced with good-made clothes that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both vile and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to escape service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococcal pus, which the soldiers buy and implicate their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often leads to a life-blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war "disarmed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No novelty on Erich María Note's front, instead of integral stories.
The volume of Mr. Englund joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came from his book, pulled out of your fingers that dramatist personae page, and burned it with a wax.
After a false advance step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
Monday night was chosen on Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre, his presence emphasized how the operation was faced with challenges for the police department.
Recent weeks' episodes, such as spray spray spraying peppers on demonstrators, infringing the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of demonstrators revealed itself after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared to see how occupations had been developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going into Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters appeared before long after they heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers gather at the crossing of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan bridge, before leaving.
The lights and prerecorded messages from speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue trimmings, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesperson for the police department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been brutally treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense handful of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic stuffed with clothes, Department of Cleaning equipment followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterward.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were chained between them by their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "amendment of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposit, the head of the department, the senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
They stood barricades on Cortlandt Street, a block to the north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At a given moment, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The Union of Support Workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that care for poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that the union leaders described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
In an audience at the City Council last month, the Education Adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be fired.
Municipal District officials 37 said that they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Education Department that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the claim, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The application will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin women, as well as the majority of those who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on his specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, since they had been underfunded in a chronic manner.
It is noted that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schoolchildren lost their jobs in the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in the 8th and 9th Districts in the South of the Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of the district 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that the principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" most often describes the act of transferring a teacher from the payroll of a school to a workbag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," says the complaint's draft, "and not only in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that eventually Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and killed, and for the participation of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "validity".
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, when they start rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting with each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress as annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
Next, the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to release themselves" and " commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their partners in the coalition that participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declars the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide legislators as the June Bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the committee.
Lugar spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between them.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment to the budget balance only in the House, and another punch that will "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially newly-wed Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of this amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfil, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two terms limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as members have been when proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to burn at a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway melody "The Sun Will Go Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and moved from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "That's good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special "20/20" hour-long program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new couple's book, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope".
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the 8 January shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her shaved head and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while the therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A leaf of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "all," a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who has been on therapy for two hours every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper about the murder of 12 March when she arrested him for the first time to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that in a moment of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back with more strength than ever."
Troops make them feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marine children broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them like a sort of orphan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
Markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been taken over by the military and a often distant American audience.
The troops are commended for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is acting more and more as if they're giving him grief for those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath faced by the troops who returned in the last few years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the pity talks are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two children returned from fighting the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was an "enraged and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under pressure from demanding Washington work immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historical audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It's an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the native of Texas put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and old military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the claim they have brought against the ex-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in reducing the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men all claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their colleagues, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or providing adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he goes for the army's biggest plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by present or old soldiers for the injuries suffered by the armed forces.
By a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiff's military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in motion, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a demand against the army that focuses on diagnoses of "personal disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them discharge of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a claim in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the way he handles claims for benefits to persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine bills have been submitted separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Addiction and the Department of Defence Response.
However, the attacks are notably reported below, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which amount to approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the reported cases in the army were brought to trial - half as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he denounced the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted herself to a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the unit of psychiatry, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, the service was dispensed under less-honored terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefit.
As for whether the case submitted by Lyman and his colleagues in demand continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington Law School.
However, he says, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is behind decades because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not going its way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to get on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the UK Research Centre DEMOS.
The range of personal information on Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then sent them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: The online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a sort of turn, "those who combine their activism online with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the site's name on the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people you could not approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that--you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that university students who talked about their rubber exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their rubbers.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Child Health, Behaviour and Development Center at the Seattle Child Research Institute, Washington Post said.
"We've found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinking" to its own population to obtain data.
The Site's Data Team has developed statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the prospect of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders have long claimed that the site should make available to others its large amount of research data).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to store your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for all.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could be examining his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study that conducted with the public student Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a hat and pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social is still happening offline."
"Friend and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Temple Knights of Norway," he said in a room filled with 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked up.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor at the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue dress and tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and survivors in his eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a greater "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill person, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 Lessons of Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, are shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with recently rediscovered Jobs that has been dusted out as a step forward of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognizable designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a youngki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds on the debut of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively in his new NeXT computer company, awaiting popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the manager's garage.
This slightly republished archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster to the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer anxiously at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to take a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs leads to detail his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disagreed by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good copper, and then adjusted to a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written widely about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tried the box by using a public phone, making one call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were getting things all around the world half a dozen times and screaming through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone next door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think it ever existed without Apple.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst into carcasses just before the Pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the telephone guide and called him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he was dedicated to selling a handful of base plates, a customer asked him if he could mount the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out how the finished devices were assembled and delivered.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got mad and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Say you work in IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, so what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so these kinds of people who end up running companies and people in charge of products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is rotten because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do that make electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
At the end, everything is reduced to taste - it goes down to trying to expose you to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas eat with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health assistance law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hired at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who would present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a demand from 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that had been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the application and, in fact, a historical claim of 5 and a half hours by March is expected, and the result will probably further disrupt the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's government.
Clement's law firm Bancroft PLLC was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Affairs.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Code Canon 4C, which says, "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, even if the judge cannot be a speaker, an honored guest, or be included in the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who act by the court for the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were bribed in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticisms that say they mix the activity of the court too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as to be impartial now.
Kagan has given no indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing receives a record order of $18 billion
Emirates Airline requests 50 double-pass aircraft Boeing 777, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than one billion dollars.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of $18 billion.
It's as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future plane orders.
In a study on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his greatest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double corridor.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Airport Hall 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which assumes fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to the airlines, because it is one of the greatest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in oil prices.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request from the Emirates solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep the Airbus SAS competitor in line with his attempt to invade his domain with the passenger plane A350.
Boeing's victory at the air fair took place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the start to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón states that drug traffickers helped their PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governor's fight.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to Michoacán's governor during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to tilt the race in favour of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results took the lead in the career as governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The crime intervention organized throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they took over the polls, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed Calderón for a short time, who had led the pre-election polls.
Calderón, a candidate from the conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, was third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, no matter how unpleasant the Michoacán elections appear, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, towards next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything" to speed up the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries that observe Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together on this."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, it's by all means."
The European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
Over the last few days, Italy's debt costs have been dangerously fired and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about two dollars a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won't work," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous well-paid workers of the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and generating losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens with "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "low-down risks" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts that are accompanied could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "sequestration", would give rise to 23 percent of global reductions and a high to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects cannot be executed - three-quarters of a boat or building cannot be bought - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to set aside many of our civil servants unintentionally and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good disposition."
The cuts in time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While funding for times of war in offshore contingency accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the core budgets," said Panetta.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and monitoring of the contract supporting the war."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would result in a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," Senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which you can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent Senators' warnings increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts are to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about the possible cuts, despite having come to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from moral weakness, inadequate preparation and is not able to keep up with potential opponents."
"In fact, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions " generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed before all over the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional F35 tests could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but their supporters say that it is the next vital step to improve and address the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment charges with several women; each party charges lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "traped" with an open-label microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and seizures countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his dissidents quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infringing the funding of the campaign related to the covering of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lives will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about the traps are widely spread in school and university exams.
There have been cases where teachers have given the answers of the exams to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How deceptive are we?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that the unknown lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to say: "I have you," the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
Liars do look in the eyes.
They don't always stutter, bluff, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the microfaced expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years investigating scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented minds," while women say more "oriented-to-other" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their mates than those who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "great").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when you lie to him.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps to provide benchmarks to measure later changes.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It is better to know if someone usually hits his foot all the time to avoid making unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly or exhibit a "post-interview shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all difficult questions have ended.
The interrogators often falsely point out that the interview ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson kicked his foot to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of the US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating trade unions, while pacifying environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that the planned pipeline will move out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's director, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until further potential routes were studied to avoid the areas of the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," said representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may separate any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have been betting on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force a removal from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's inspector general had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby contracted by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a signature that was contracted to lead the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up fear
A New York family says that the record music diva, Patti LaBelle, acted like a crazy woman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point of she vomited out of fear.
The Diatric of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much so that he suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers," says his family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when Tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Boulevard Riverside building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said to her, "Yes, and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman that she was angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter by the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He became angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle swung over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and withdrawing from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but she did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what had happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money that he can get to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed to a kindergarten teacher who holds an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate Adversity curbed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated of change, who generated great expectations for progress in the economy, but given the early climate adversity of the year, growth is not observed, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of the overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice cream allocations issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage in 582,000 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main damaged crops were vegetables, maize and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen an accelerated growth, as while January to March 55 thousand 053 signal citizens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, by the second quarter the rate increased to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of unemployed people to more than 74 thousand signals, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less Liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have taken place since public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation adopted at the congress to combat money laundering, and for people who take dollars illegally, it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in rising unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour wages is low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of signanese workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,000 375 pesos.
FDI Contraction
Together with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the highest decrease in Direct Foreign Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the State FDI Secretariat from January to June, amounting to $630,697, representing a fall of 87,74 per cent compared to the $5 million 143,000,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17 000 280 million pesos per year, mainly from third-party companies.
The debt
In the context of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the state congress to approve a 3 billion pesos credit, even though investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a total of 2 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he failed to harmonize the will of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year ice cream stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"Low economic flow is the result of several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn back fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and so at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, stated that it is necessary to lead the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that best guides the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in driving public policy.
"There are elements to say that the Government is becoming more inclusive, I can say is that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
They condemn him for 8 kg of marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 days in fine was sentenced to a neighbor of Navolato for the possession of eight kilograms of mariguan.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted Narcomenudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of anti-health, in his variant of mariguan possession for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in El Castillo village, Navolato.
The Narcomenudist circulated in a pick-up truck, white, where he wore a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the Second District Judge, and the sentenced person continues to be an intern in the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Should contribute for works
Social works covered by programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal social development indicated that, although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because they have not fulfilled the State Government ' s contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in concluding them is in effect.
"It's almost 12 million what they're given, and although the year is about to end, we haven't been given a fifth, when since July they've had to give us a share," he said, "we've started the works and they're going very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not contribute on that occasion to the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous sex year because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left behind," he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite efforts to ensure that their corresponding percentages are reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what they're given, and although the year is about to end, we haven't been given a fifth."
Court valid "analog parrot" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, not bringing together the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The full ministers also decided to dismiss the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President said he did not match the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive could not structure measures to prepare the public administration through general rules.
"I also do not consider that if I did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal executive, who is constitutionally mandated, the head of the State.
The substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "then it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he pointed out, "require the operation of the whole established system, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the State executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the executive, despite highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, by issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of Congress, is being provided in the administrative field the observance of laws issued by the legislature, ensured.
They analyze the possibility of a voting vote count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, although the votes for 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 minutes are not recorded.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data from the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, only on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, provided that the Congress of the State passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits provided for in the State Official Journal Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified the state representative's vote for constitutional reforms as "unvalid and illegal" as the vote of the state representative, provided he has no right to "sanitary or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In such a way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be held on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of the balloting and the record of the ballot or not open to the President of the ballot; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the voting boxes may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition who postulated the second one of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the alleged winner candidate and the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages which have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, but without counting the votes of 129 of the total 923 minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, their hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday they held recognitions and a requiem Mass.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel's last will was that his ashes were scattered in Zapalinamé's Sierra.
After receiving a tribute on the side of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.

Felipe Bacio Cortés went very young out of the city of Saltillo to join the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said it even dizzy in the truck; however, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "only in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in his life: flying an aircraft.
They give you the last goodbye.

They locate three bodies abandoned on Cadreyta NL's estate
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed with bullets in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, on an abandoned farm of the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding occurred on the 1.5 km of the road from Cadreyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose barda is beige color with coffee, was the door open in pairs.
Looking inwards, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three persons, and they immediately notified the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow play with a dark mussel trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with a white tyranny play.
A few feet away was the body of another individual with red play and blue mussel pants.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three persons would have been killed elsewhere, since no shells were found on the site.
Legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another are appreciated at the barda of the fifth, in addition to several holes of bullet in the same and the gate.
Captured to 11 in Cadreyta

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of the economic disaster
The so-called Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
A press release from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The frame is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the central right-wing party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the majority technocrat government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister would succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should consist only of technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties are making the attempt to include political figures complicated.
The rock of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 summoned arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 gathered by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Stadium of San José.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide register of Class A inter-election games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain intense activity in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level collisions in European cups such as Champions League.
He was added to the above experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World Cup of Football.
On the contrary, footballers possess a limited international rock in an area such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the best record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Iaker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international encounters.
Boxes will play today before the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the brain wheel of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the week before by UEFA along with the other hundred years of the Iberian team, the so-called Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariete, Raúl González with 102.
Nearly the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz artilleryr, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't close at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historical taster of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the most recorded with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two decades journey tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to turn into reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two decades-long working tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is on La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I wonder why there is some kind of band devotion, fans live in intensity the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great surfing places; that's how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have been long away from playing, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that could have forgotten us.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
On this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us can imagine that we would be on a big rock band and have been doing it for more than 20 years it seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is somewhat unusual.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time from one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we are lucky to be friends of all of them still and we honor to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band such as yours will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word of fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too on tour because it is easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without getting mad at being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because it will last so long and most important is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy went and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The Las Robertas national band will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we're eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are their influences?
It's so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant in spite of being no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may look lighter, but there's also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who served a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which other pathologies such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs have been added, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving prison since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilated squad who operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in all political affairs between the two nations," said the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French representative Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world since November, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has in recent years tried to speed up the creation of fiscal exchange agreements in order to exit the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TBT), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotudo fountain passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tireless, over 25 years to save the princess Peach from the wicked Bowser claws, but never had so far done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without needing to wear glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopic without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support" , since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has claimed that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the levels of the game, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also involves turning the character to a portable console, which had not been produced since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, the followers of the saga are shackled and repeat the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting that the muster of the muster will have to go through risk mining platforms in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new developments in movements, environments, disguises and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he gave the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to wash US$70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country of the north that called for Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account the fact that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He stated that during his term of office he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave the process to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Walles, both for drug trafficking.
The act by Colom implies an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the ex-spondator between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has dissolved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the breakdown of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was held yesterday in an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in Trinidad Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of degradation or in a situation of marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the act was attended by former adviser of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councilor Richard Gomà.
They also attended the large Fabra i Coats Hall, the current councillor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is, too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president set an example for Trinijove to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new to the entity and to the work it does," he said.
Locating a busy farm where macro-fests were made
The invaders had won 11 out of the 13 floors of the building at Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm on noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday on their voluntary basis the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-fiestas that desperate the neighborhood, in court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
Okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowds parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the lodgers.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, since they sold the glasses to three euros, while at the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had had to respond to neighborhood complaints by noise, while, he pointed out, the nuisances did not provoke the club customers, but the inhabitants of the ocupada house and, above all, the participants at the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the nuisances were so big that it even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and nine months ago that "forgive him" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the building to end the problems of coexistence and civics that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the past few months the okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and on almost all the floors, and that in any one of them there had been thefts.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be powerful against the incivism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of convening beyond polemics on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some promotion pasquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Furthermore, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few who do not head on the north-south axis until above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is a result of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis on the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the town hall convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other gates of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what constitutes reflection on the city, is the topic of conversation among all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost already a recurring theme to which to hand when two members of this former caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonian architects believe, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roland, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", every time the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can start from the basis that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Colserola gate" encloses a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where to act".
Model, like Roland and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal of "intellectual network" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from "the fact that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80's and had in the area of the Forum "his singing of the swan".
The first fear is the delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is fixing the next step," that is, its overstep.
"We need to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (GPM)] can lead to real disasters."
More concerned to the question, Model believes that, simplifying the valley side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
Model recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken bag", although he thanks the opportunity that the city council offers to its guile to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", points out) that have had to be created: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional contests -dice - in the sense of the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect at the door next door.
In his view, the town hall should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal owner of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmails
After staying in prison 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal owner of the Casino Red granted him forgiveness to the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the city council re-omontan would allow the clandestine operation of the bet house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Palitan mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Ararigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
In that place he remained for the next 49 days after a second order of roots was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s agent had dried up the crimes of rockets and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadreyta criminal allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, only a few hours remained in the middle security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October he was given a warrant of apprehension by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of investigations proved sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of it.
This Monday, the legal owner of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came before Judge José Luis Pecina to apologize for the mayor's brother; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the members of the house of betting was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonah Larrazábal and, subsequently, no claim may be lodged concerning the process following him; in addition to the need for compensation for damage or punishment.
Following the hearing of the legal officer of the betting house, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of the Juzgado, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane accident where he lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven others, indicate that the helicopter directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were the right conditions to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the aspas had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the research done in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search there are reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, research can last for several months, even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft terrain ascending.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical normability the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew should have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM were suitable for take-off conditions, as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, with low-level cloud layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has sought a less elevated area and increased visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of remains of the aircraft in a small area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side path.
The pattern of dispersal of remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
On the site of the sinister remains undisclosed evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the research indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the field.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 billion 200 feet above the average sea level, and the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to be disarranged along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the site agreed around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Conducts Social Security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; is supported by IDN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it conducts research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will enable markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nurses and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvesav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (INP).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate, whether or not right-to-be, to visit the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico West) and that since 8 October, the activity is carried out at the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the objective of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
At the celebration of World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he stated that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and hereditary history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He noted that on Saturdays all participants apply anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, glucose levels determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys noted that, in just six years, there was an increase of 77 percent in obesity among children and girls by 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed', the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows them to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the probability of metabolic and even predisabetes alterations.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they need to make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugared beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid berries
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemicals, develops polymer modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 berries each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the right one, the berries could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
At his conference A technological opinion of the berries, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory at its charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of berries.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight ones, called asphalts, and others of low molecular weight, called malts, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, added.
The above means that asphalt resistance is not uniform in the streets, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that most streets in Mexico City are covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
In the case of modified asphalt, the chemical engineer was of the opinion.
On the asphalt folder, abounded, a last layer called a treadmill is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with vehicle wheels, you should have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the tread folder also needs to have the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made should be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is wet, the water is diffused inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a replete of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of berries.
In the process of forming a bach, he said, the first to wear out is the film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should meet the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of berries and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the floor must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, to avoid frequent berries forming.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair berries easily and without needing to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princess.
Once again the Caucasian Valley remains in the desire of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the podium of winners, shine the silver crown and the band that believe her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legion of Vallecaucacan women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie García Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Señora Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key to the jury's decision to appoint her Prime Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gomez of the Leamos Literary Cartel.
To the interrogator, the Vallecaucacan replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing myself, I definitely think the book that marked me as childhood is "The Principle," is a pretty deep book.
I now read "Crimen and Punishment," is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
An answer that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a specific way how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, he expressed himself calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The beginning" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that favorism burned in Valle.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that, by being the favourite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy net, the vote of the public for the best craftsmanship suit, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first presentation in swimsuit on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both of them were safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic proved.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "As at Home" program of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "checks that the candidate who wins most prizes during the contest does not remain queen".
In addition, Valle showed herself to the last very dodge with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to her country's social needs.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of its defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very notorious, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here she was collected."
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in bath suit came up a cruel Vatican that was accomplished last night, for it was said that this was the container that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina has since begun a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her rolling passage through Cartagena, was prevented from the crown.
This was the work of the calenho that identified Alfonso Cano's body
A lophoscopist from Cali passed into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopist from the Cali ITC passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the stamp of his fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists working at the ITC section, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after performing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, the palms of his hands and feet.
The week of operation against Alfonso Cano alias to Elazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry Guillermo Leon Sáenz's cadactillary card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, wearing glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Elias compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the footprint
For a typtiloscopicist of the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Elias González, in the press wheel for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dictyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can become a key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many delinquents present false ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint and we search them in the database.
The researcher reported that, in a case of theft, he was struck by removing a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently they found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a trace in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
One ITC tyctyloscopeist explained that in the objects "the prints are taken with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes trace.
However, if it can be used, if the respective knife is made.
"Indignants" Challenge Authorities in New York · Global Voices
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, into Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allows the "indignant" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a more northern park in the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to set up somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of his camp, which was personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already been moved to support members of the movement and that it had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this very Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced there carried and distributed copies of that order and even handed them over to the agents in charge of the plaza, which resulted in "a few small clashes," Bray pointed out, who denounced that some officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or from prohibiting protesters from entering the park again with shops or other properties they used earlier."
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which approximately 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violent of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm others", since "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that at the Bloomberg fund he is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Wall Street Occupation" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions, to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, will appear in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a partner of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other Canadian prominent, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which he appears together with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding on a manger a doll that represents Jesus.
At the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian comic artist who recently acted as part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appeared as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas of CTV has Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married in Buenos Aires to the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and which is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that started in March.
Since last March, the Japanese economy had been paralysed by the devastating earthquake that came to be in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country had suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for material losses in $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appeared to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annual rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the rebound of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1%, as compared to the decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure from January to March, the first downturn after six months of continuous increases.
However, the real revolution of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use deficits to grow from scratch.
Japan has mainly awakened by changing domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Yen's stigma
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs as a loss in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, focused their weak results between July and September on the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue to harass the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of yen, need to be borne in mind," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that the majority of member countries presented sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, at level 100, when eight tenths were down to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds back on the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is more imposed by Brussels' demands than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may remain short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support further austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the staff disciplinary code and further measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his visa good to any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still in the grip of the papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8 billion, although there is no final date.
The Greek wood still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading global place in the role of Microfinance."
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades in the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose " essence" said it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that these operations are "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with 2015 horizon, and, "especially, in the one whose goal is the reduction of half the volume of people living below a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is set.
Spain "keeps working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", would benefit from these loans.
They are "many achievements achieved" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is set up not only as a discussion forum, but also as a platform from which to drive "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will come from the poverty line at which they are sinking.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to find out about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor's coach".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcrediters assume "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work on solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the "success" of giving "trust" to people "excluding those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
On the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, there was no great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future had not initially been included on the agenda, but the issue was put in the autumn, particularly to satisfy the militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too restrictive with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against were recorded and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the urophilo Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be expressed in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball's on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive based on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Looking forward to calming the moods within your party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that he has tried to win at his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of sick death fraud
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sickness casualties.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sickness casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day's shortage on private sector workers before they can take the fall.
Finally, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but which would save EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of non-remuneration in the event of low-employment (to date, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of job losses.
"There will be a significant increase in controls and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of job losses.
In fact, since 2002, there has been constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually resulted.
The French are only infirming in the rest of Europe.
Let us take a closer look at national figures first.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million was paid in 2006 in lower-labour benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, the lowering subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to sick leave, which amounts to EUR 6,200 million.
Therefore, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days of low work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day's sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Sickness Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of sickly deaths were less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and 1 month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted by two CNRS researchers in 2010 indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10 to 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls on disease deaths over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were "dequately adapted or unjustified; a figure which, with a total of 1.2 million as departure, amounted to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases were reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
No doubt, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to the MP of UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of lower subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; he added that the hundred days that have been granted to his union government would not be sufficient to achieve that objective.
"In order to make efforts towards the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public address during the opening of the debate on vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, since "is at stake" the country's stay in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the public deficit in the country will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed his support for the measures already adopted on Monday to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he warned that his party would not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for further measures," he said during a meeting with the Members of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as combating the collapse, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee asserts that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians are living in denial of death, as indicated in the report of the Royal Canadian Society
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is living in denial of death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medical care.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient has raised such an option and has been tried competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, as indicated by the experts selected by the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive subject of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not match the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of its application, namely the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada assisted suicide is practised, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian, Euthanasia-friendly
Let's remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia, since they think it would allow people whose death is close to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
With regard to persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of healthcare for a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that the Criminal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because euthanasia practice is not limited to those who are terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" with regard to the findings of the report, which called it "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a plot
Syria is getting more and more isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad spoke to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces that there is a "combat" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have expressed support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "leave power" in Syria, where there have already been 40 deaths of civilians and members of the regime's forces.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the Syrian-neighbored King of Jordan in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been making in Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
On the other hand, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region of southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, as indicated by that NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem considers the country to be "progress towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which in his view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not falter," he added, ensuring that "the plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is enclosed in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is expected to be held tomorrow in Rabat to develop the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of opposition and the release of the demonstrators in custody.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday judged the Arab League's decision as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to train their team and to launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the appointed Council.
For his part, the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt by a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its programme, he added, adding that it is "sure that markets will have patience and will understand it".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "political".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, date of the next legislative period, it considers.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's vote of confidence before Friday.
Monti is committed to working, when he is in charge, taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy 'recovering its role' in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn has emphasized that "even with a new government, it will not vary our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
The Italian "chief of chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mate, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid an early election, since Italy has to place some €200 billion in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, as stated on Monday by an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its " grave concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of your company would have brought you in contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as reported by the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49 per cent, as compared to a 13 per cent increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as indicated by the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have increased again," said the Human Rights First human rights organization, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one organization leader, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified its platform presentation on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people who follow, which causes their service to look a little bit more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and a "name" tab enables you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow you on the Internet.
This allows you to know if you follow messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you qualify as a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as indicated to AFP by Twitter's spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instintive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward another person's message, follow-friday to recommend following another user) giving the happiness of the initiates, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable approach to that of the major public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users have debated with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity is going to help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "gold rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "gold rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus to avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (Triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest every year," said the Christian Democratic Vice Chancellor of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area of 26 October: in it, Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act with equivalent value.
The procedure adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional and common States should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by the rate of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
A Strong Overhang
Noda threatens with a new intervention of the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We'll intervene, as we did last time, if we check that excessive volatility occurs" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen ascended to levels close to the historical peaks that resulted in the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the United States currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refugee value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar came back on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was paid to around 120 yen and the euro to more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is damaging to the exports of the archipelago, as it energizes the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), pointed out Noda, who fears that the enrichment of the yen root cut the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect "Japanese economic bases".
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased by five billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of Treasury Letters, bringing to the 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
euro area:
the types grow, the bags weaken
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to affect European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges sink a little further in the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions in relation to the yields of loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to be part of their recent earnings."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, renewing market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place on a margin of small variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reopening of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion which provides, in particular, for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types are more than 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations at 10 years was 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has taken time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of being suffocated with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the market point of view, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between the 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has seen an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than 0.3% projected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the figure of the second quarter downwards, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has seen a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it considers the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double the electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will need to be alleviated in order to continue to produce continuous electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not alter any of these parameters.
For this reason, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, are continuing with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resumed the construction of a power station interrupted after the crash of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The Berlin election will entail an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for gas imported, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
It should be taken into account in the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, of which 30% of its electricity obtains, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind interference; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
That is why any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not initially show opposition to that type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost its industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and can create non-movable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of most of these SMEs and the loss of the €6 billion per year in French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when the manufacturer's collapse is expected?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamenville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented reach, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electrical players who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamenville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the numeral policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights country" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, economic analysis is rarely carried out.
The question is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone set it Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-disarrollo will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
The fears associated with the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular those who are not qualified, with pressure to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and primarily work in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where training fails to meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country in need of anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows represents an increase in the long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they make an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches 30 years of age will make a net contribution (lower income) of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the points of growth that were missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it just needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the crownees in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitely over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little One, that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are living in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palindia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
You must reflect on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now been shifted and, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a high to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make blows of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, quiet and continuous, of choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
All of Europe is committed to the orders of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the lead of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to make republicans.
The revolution motivated by interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "no contact" chip are general
The world lounge of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in world sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to estimates by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year 460 million cards with no contact chip will be sold all over the world, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and to represent around 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind in relation to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the field of contactless payment.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to move ahead, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the non-contact system," Gérard Nebouy, director general of Visa Europe France announced.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out transactions.
"They're retreating."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The agricultural credit bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence services reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The call survey indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who for a long time stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before we discuss operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual external support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in their operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of ill-interested illuminators.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants are engaged in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are first orientated to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 were registered dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect radicalizes and abandons its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular against the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is disturbing all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidents, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more strutting statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point by Republicans.
The slogans, often grounded, on China, Iran, are extended to help Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulation of their currency", a key theme in America exacerbated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "disturbs" emotions.
He has requested a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt his nuclear programme.
"If I go out elected, I will stop Iran," he fanfarroned.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations with respect to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "has been trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for his part, he is willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also advocates Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are significant with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy foreign policy burden.
The current President's opponents say Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and had to loosen the plunger in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and their overthrow in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The people judge more positively Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is distrustful of military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama gives the impression that it is more just.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the valve steering wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, it will reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas each year to Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km to communicate the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 which will allow a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, that is enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk about the possibility of building a third tube through the same route.
For Gazprom, the finalization in time of this huge work presents areas of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, North Stream is going to allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it by closing its access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are as political as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-covered steel to protect it against the anchorages of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m of depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines that date back to World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for North Stream society.
It was also necessary to extend measures to protect both fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: either by valves or by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but project managers gave up on it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently in the sea off their shores.
"In case of failure, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute," needs Jens Müller.
In case of escape, gas pipeline gas will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that there will be a leak, since they have planned joints which, according to the forecasts, will have an escape every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a submarine robot, dragged by a vessel, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating through the inside of the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any repair.
Gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
Germany joined E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," said Jens Müller.
Funding for gas pipeline construction has ended by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not go beyond their investment, since Gazprom alone takes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Some valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million an hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
He has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its split white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, by then consulting the company, took care of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (top leather), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he was successful.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far remained the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to the small shops of the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer wallpapers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for employment.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Discouragement?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress that has been made for 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be noted that the unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% mean).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not finished the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is to say, there are many issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the problem," says Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; people's minds advance, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, have reached a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"Now we reach around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of establishments "under this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased from 2007 to 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which was increasing contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82 per cent of businesses with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Blues Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that generates this friendly party.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France Auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment from his front against Turkey, the Belgian picker has only praise for him.
"I am very happy for Eden, for its progress and because it is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front responds.
As to the contrast between your presentations on your team and the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shield".
Not to mention the pleasure.
It has been encouraging the Blues since I was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been your fan," he says.
Without a doubt, this will especially strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathehieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We've just faced each other recently.
"Playing them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to pride for his part.
Proud to dispute a gala party.
"Urgull" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "has returned to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said excitedly.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game of going, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selection, which has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the party of departure (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems evident that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given it peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked it out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will happen, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to participate in the 2012 Eurocopa", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz has relativized.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked it out of the house," laments Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the outset, a maximum pressure on Bosnians to "don't let them think."
A good idea, as long as it is realistic this time.
