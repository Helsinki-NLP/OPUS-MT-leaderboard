Ladies and gentlemen of the Wales Assembly are afraid to "pass through the Marretas"
There is a consternation on the part of some Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that its title should be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Galish Parliament".
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, are afraid that this will make them look ridiculous.
An AM worker said that the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-English readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and "pwp" means "excrement".
An AM from Plaid said that the group in its overall "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative Member said that the group was of "open mind" with regard to the change of name, but said that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to that of letter u in English in Yorkshire.
The House Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the House are designated will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Government of Wales Law of 2017 gave its House the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which was broadly supported by the proposal to designate the House as the "Galish Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission has favored either "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option has been more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring together the consensus may constitute a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to how the House exercises its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the committee system.
When discussing legislation, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday about the change of their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a complaint about its territory, repeatedly objecting to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Sinos of St. Martin remain silent at a time when the Harlem churches fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly people I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently" today, he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood's living rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned about the eventuality of the money gained by the sale of heritage not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, this will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was later placed by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the shopkeepers of 125th Street, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the cart.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the railing "the bells of the poor".
The specialist who played the rail in July called him something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first trolley in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the biggest trolley in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "will seek to pass on the costs", unfortunately the fact that it has not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tuberoon causes 13-year-old teen injuries in a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster dive in California, on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then ended up in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just about enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten!"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the clavicle was dilapidated, Hammel described what he observed when he came to the boy.
"I cried out to all to come out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical state.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press communication that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research purposes and for security reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections like the big stores, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the United Kingdom cosmetics market, valued at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and items to the home retreat, these major cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 shops spread across the country and will be implemented in more shops in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics comes from the search by supermarkets for ways to use exposition space used at the time for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalog of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products obey the vegan precepts, something increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second one, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, opens near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby shops led to supermarkets now having to make more effort to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly resemble large stores, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops, having also installed a series of Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this has strengthened sales of commodity products and made the most profitable purchases.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended up failing.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s but the relationship ended after a dispute about the distribution of health product stores revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical business with 281 sales points to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four shops an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones "sniffy" after Holly Willoughby left business of £11 million
Peter Jones, a star from Dragons Den, became "furiated" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left a business of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the brand of articles for home and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that she was going to leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones led by leaving the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (the value of which can amount to £1.5 million), meant that she would no longer have time to dedicate to her brand of household articles and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was going to leave Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was by far Holly's greatest priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has all been absolutely startled.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of articles ready to sell at headquarters in Marlow."
The experts believe that the release of this Morning's presenter, who is among Britain's most lucrative stars, may cost millions to the company, given the extensive investment in products, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for further delays in the launch.
In addition, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and her wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
Couples are on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand-name ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity program for ITV.
A nearby source of Jones said last night that "we don't want to comment on their business."
"And then we fell in love"
The president of the United States gladly mentioned the criticism that he would be the target of the media for making a comment that some would consider "indignified by a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in at once?
Trump said, in his pretended voice of "telejournal poppy."
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, highlighting that it would be a major step in the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "response" from the US at the first steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the mortal remnants of US military.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly ahead.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia causes devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told to foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid channelling.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were clear to state that they are not asking for international help; so it becomes a bit difficult," Mrs Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that is going to go to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether it would be possible for international agencies to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly poorly prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm series in Palu, which is a poor degree of the validity of a warning, would have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on their way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the infrastructure improvement decrepite a central part of his electoral campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has left Mr Joko's executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets using catanas, bows, and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the google draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's ballast, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before he made a finish towards the second stop.
In an attempt, the ball flew high over the large area by going to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga flying and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players as Shaq advance as much as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I got a touch and didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won by 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this play, the advance of the blues gave a step back to Mateo Kovacic before it disengaged near the middle camp and made a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he made a beautiful finish that went through the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
This went beyond the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second brake with a left foot finish that passed through the network guard Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the Champions League on the third afternoon of Wednesday, at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency at the beginning of Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the ruins of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman's stablishment until death
A homicide investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead on Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on Grayson Mews, on John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police urged the population of the area that might have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious that they contacted us.
I would also like to appeal to those who may have obtained images with tablier cameras, particularly taxi drivers, who contact us, because they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to investigate where she had been found this morning.
The investigations are under way, with the police saying that you are currently informing the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he ran out of words.
Residents are now being informed that they can only return to their homes within hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly claims that "it's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were within the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers inside the cordon were highlighted to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information that contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers through number 0800 555 111 indicating record 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has become the latest monument swallowed up by the content of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which recalls the perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "insanity" and "an attempt to rewrite History."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to Westminster Palace became a target for slaughter.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of the opinion of the 19th century and on the part of historiography of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in its case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not such a description is entirely accurate is the subject of a historical debate that is continuing.
What is true is that the 17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut artery covered with blood, near a pocilga in the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou province, read at the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject swine vaccines into a pig growing on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door for an open neighbor.
In that puddle, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilos, had attacked the pig until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed," said the cousin, referred to by his name "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Your body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent him from attacking other people while the police collected evidence at the scene of the occurrence.
Reports state that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have already been reported to humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig with 300 kilos immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as "stimulation".
"They're just kidding.
They like to beautify, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We only need to show them due respect," he said.
Hurricane Requisitions Rosa should bring widespread strong rain to the south-west of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening by moving over the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time of Sunday, the Rosa caused 137 km/h raids, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it begins to take shape a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the lower California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity toward the north in the southwest part of the United States.
On Monday it will cause precipitation which may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce strong rains widespread in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause sudden dangerous floods, littered with debris and possibly landsfills in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5-7 mm in spot zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in southwest areas, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions are possible due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unwise to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation can make the passersby turn into angry rivers and the trovadas will bring strong punctual winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring strong precipitation on parts of the southern coast line of California.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which may cause small engulfed debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
There will begin to occur in Arizona some tropical waterfalls scattered at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until fourth.
The month of October can show strong changes in temperature throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical areas will remain quite thin.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic differences in temperature throughout the U.S. central area on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern US area is expected to record a hot start of October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term time forecast indicates a high probability of the occurrence of temperatures above average in the eastern US until the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended the Brett Kavanaugh audience
More than 20 million people attended yesterday at six television stations to the rapist witness of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of allegedly sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute revolution: an agreement prepared by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that he is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh beat her as drunk and tried to throw her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen's number on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company recorded the average number of spectators in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences from those who watch office programs.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audiences similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC went second with 3.26 million spectators.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican cabinet issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was captured by the chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look down while he was criticized live for CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have to say more at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in a short time later, when the Judicial Commission went to the vote to make the appointment of Kavanaugh continue for a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do it in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union of "polyticizing" with Britain's future and harming national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the "Checkers Plan" of the Minister for Brexit, claiming that a proposal which provides that Britain and the EU cover the fares on the other side is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims homicide: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson from LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect from Sims' death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Department of the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene of the occurrence and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, news of WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had hit Wayde fatally with a firearm.
A loan of USD 350 000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department notes that the collaboration of the action group of the State Police of Louisiana, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the police of Southern University and residents of the area that collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local authorities for their "diligent and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20.
This advanced, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us in permanence," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ashes in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after a resumption of crater activity, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center has detected numerous deaf and trembling noises.
Images on social networks showed fine layers of gray covering the windshields of automobiles in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicals recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protestors and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum polarizing on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, caught by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw ink in dust, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups that sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters, who shouted "Long life for Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatment of minor injuries suffered in the protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region prone to independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The voters chose overwhelmingly independence, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against it.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote at polling stations scattered across the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although it was performed, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're blocked," he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangible victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independentist parties have had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year, with their best known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been holding trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crashing against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had repeatedly been beaten in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there were damage in the gates and in the building itself.
In a certain moment, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga attack gives a 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, frightened Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a technical of the Ibonox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed from level to level with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a win outside the house in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at the Europa League at home on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended its succession of undefeated confrontations to six games in the division, with the main coach Holt without losing one time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against visitors who have become numb
The Holt team should have moved ahead with the marker long before the goal, as the incisive character of its game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson entered the defense, but let himself drag himself in front of the ball and then Alan Lithgow only managed to drive his effort away after he scrutinised to find Craig Halkett's head on the ball.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble to visitors in the stopped ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
Rangers gave a free pass and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and the network guard Liam Kelly didn't have any big problems.
This pattern continued in part two, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers' network guard Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a far-off touch from another liveston stopped ball game.
They continued to come crossings to the large Livingston area, which were subsequently resolved, and two claims of great penalty, one after Halkett's investigation of replacement Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were refused by the arbitrator.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alaskar Lamont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His game style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but you need to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
His final play was uninspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a sort of warning to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters pointed to their presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, were also heard, condemning both the President's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died on a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south of the city, about 10:15, British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist on a collision on Childers Street, about a kilometer and a half of the Saturday crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and deviations for buses were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, reported the Prison Office.
The disturbances, which are still continuing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 09:30, British summer time, on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" were called to resolve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
Agents were treated with small facial wounds on site.
A spokesperson for Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they may spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by drought may benefit)
A tropical depression is rare to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa crosses the southwest Desert, involving the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, to the south and east areas of Nevada, to the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct course on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix referred to a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Center of Hurricanes provide for 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southeast Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total isolated ones that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of the Rosa may constitute a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," reported the weather.com website.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass across the California Baja Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected that it will reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with possible maximums of 25 mm," said the weather.com website.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or its remains is the very high precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the southwest desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and cloudy floods of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and floods in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with cutting gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4:00, British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
During the night, a 17-year-old, two-year-old and a 20-year-old in the Radstock area, reported to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have appealed to everyone who can own mobile footage of the event.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was the victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, having strongly and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage."
"A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service curriculum," he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the republican influx to the polls in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not competing, but actually I'm competing," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, CNN said a main deputy to the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, having been victims of the event," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency to minimize the effect of the disasters of Indonesia (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, distorted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Indonesia Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the huge Friday wave was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were found imprisoned under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and the damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area with the name of Dojaga, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Dojaka, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300 000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves occurred at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut of energy that interrupted communications in the area of Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is rising exponentially to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although he has managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in his office yard, the staff of the World Vision of Dojaga crossed devastated scenes on his way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to undertake the dark tasks of assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel may only be allowed access to the site if it is declared 'national disaster zone'.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government says "OK, this is a national catastrophe" we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status doesn't exist yet."
By falling from the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagei, were your students.
"As a senior paragliding practicer, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate between the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during automatic refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's official who was refuelling an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "raised up running behind Brink's official" and stole a bag of money for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the place, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police via number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name - to Ye.
When announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The Being formerly known by Kanye West."
West, age 41, received Ye nickname some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it by "emotional motives", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I believe that "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said at the beginning of this year, when he commented the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So, it's you, it's us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one," to only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military attacks against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador committed not to use military force against civilians at a time when the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research expenditure in this field, said the investor and professional of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
"Dupplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new AI revolution," said Lee.
Duplicate funding could double the chances of the next major success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Innovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, the Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an AI system that defeated the best rated American player in Othello. Later, he served as executive in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technological contests such as Robotics Challenge from the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university luminaries to work in AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to boost its efforts in the area of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Chinese Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that intended to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbor's name in the north represents a complaint about its territory and has denied its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the voter attendance would be sufficient to meet the 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it in favour of entry into NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in organisations with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there had been no irregularities by one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared with the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of name of the country, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by which the referendum will boycott.
"We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to stick head-on and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to receive us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value below the necessary influx.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first important concern in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took possession last May.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City crosses all Brighton's defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling had forgotten Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I was making it look ridiculously easy on your goal at minute 65.
The Argentinian advanced received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
It carried out a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He ended a defense before neutralizing others in the race within the limits of the great Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's netguard with a finish on the right side of the network.
"He is now debating himself with some problems on his feet," said the reporters Pep Guardiola, coach of the City.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in that game.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second trave.
The advanced Sky Blues kicked the ball into the network immediately before sliding out of the boundaries of the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim during the Champions League group phase at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker wants to make life difficult for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the end for the Rockies, who hold a lead game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but still have intentions to secure their title of the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the headline launcher for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the releases in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th beginning, gave a session on the bullpen on Thursday and launched in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 ERA and 300 strokes in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump plays debut in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of republican influx in the interim elections.
"Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm fighting everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they're watching it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they're fighting with, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, deaf and liars."
The president referred to the name Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, having received sounds from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to escape?
Hah, hah, what?
No, no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was not a surprise to me.
Finally, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament to whom it has been said they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was the target of similar treatment because he resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday mentioned that "we intend meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" policy has been long forgotten, if it has ever come true.
It became increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and assume positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and no matter really what I say), there is a stream of insults on social networks that call for "disposal", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have received tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never retreat before them.
One of the things that most disappoints me in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censor" or amendment of the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I received numerous advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and that so "it would do all right" for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party for 32 years as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who most need them, either as an author or as a minister in government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the message I have is not for Nottingham's Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "disposal" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe are the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow sent out the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this incredibly interesting game of Tenent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and remain unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to Ayr. They handled risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, assigned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the mid-time, had marked and then converted a solo trial to place the marker Nos 17-5 to the Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the recommendation, Ayr strengthened the leadership with a Stafford McDowall test converted by Climo.
The captain of the Ayr in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with a non-converted test of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having dropped Climate without the ball, in the launch of penalty, MacPherson put the ball on the floor behind the Maul in progress of the Ayr.
Climate converted, as it had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the fifth rehearsal of the house team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, who writes and participates with long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The pair announced that the ninth season, soon to be premiered, will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "flowery business of Glasgow restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Marines patrol a naval base covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-marine flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for Amazons bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting him back is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the delivery of the TIJ sentence on giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague court will deliberate in favour of its country's complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for the re-election next year, also has much to do with Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," was the President's vote last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will deliberate in favor of Bolivia, and that little would even change otherwise.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the sentence of TIJ be given only six months after hearing the final claims indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Pas Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt her.
"The question of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric threatened some Chilean residual good-will, suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility of "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
" Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea states that there will be no disarmament without the country relying on the United States
North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation will never remove its nuclear weapons if it does not rely on Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompey appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and US objection to a statement that puts an end to the Korean war will never take the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking a significant first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking for a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang having really intended to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the gateway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their 2019 spring-summer collections, which made the style set in Paris Fashion Week amazed.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad tab similar to a pen that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included key jeweled eggplants, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks... even in time of the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had boiled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seams.
One of the creations looked like diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
The stylistic observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the very little practical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the gateways: a bag of straw beach almost as large as the model in fact of bathroom carrying it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange color, decorated with strips of rafia and with a white leather strap, was the most prominent piece of the 2019 spring-summer collection La Riviera of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags arrive at the shops next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30 000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service, both for students and parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can enter his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot rely solely on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we found that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum A classification.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained the maximum A score in mandarim, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are promoting foreign languages as vital competences that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A survey by the UK Employment and Competence Commission in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for employers' difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% concerned the shortage of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a skill for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a ratio of two digits, 15%.
Therefore, investing in language teaching now is important for today's children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding jobs with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as mandarim or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is ending for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James will participate in the opening game of the pre-timed Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet claiming that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training at the beginning of this week, James was questioned about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-time.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's debut in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaigning concerts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five concerts scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending form vote for your choice for the Supreme Court strike, Trump intends to strengthen support for the interim elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time is Trump's debut in West Virginia tonight and how do you view it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is marked at 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to watch Trump's debut in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings this week to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The expected confirmation vote in the Senate will be pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this stream of riots is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
So, in charge of President Trump's campaign, he stated that these five summits next week aim "to give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," said Reuters.
"Congress control is as fundamental to the President's agenda as it will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the agitation of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign that refused to be quoted, Reuters told.
Marked for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event of soon-to-night can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in polls.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in polling," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates that it has strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon ants may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're looking at it as a little bit of momentum, I would say," said Jordan Spieth while he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in benefit, of course, with four points ahead and another twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tea to green and is leading by example.
Those gutural shouts of celebration were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match in the 15th produced a similar scream, that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all left to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, improbable but adorable, is four in four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way its energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory at sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when on team with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front shoved the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they were never close to going out.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of him.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to see closely due to interactions between partners, advice that gives or does not and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this ant session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of Ryder Cup with a loose advantage after it has left the fourballs and ants of Saturday departures with a 10-6 leadership in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty in reaching the classification in the Le Golf National, so far, of four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series for 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in forsomes with two winning matches, but they failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's singles 12 to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to win four points in their four opening matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superimposed the advantage, defeating an energyless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional accesses of genius, but has already lost 19 of the matches he played in fourballs and ants, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the ants, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze to the south-west of Paris, Europe has not always made the best possible.
Jordan Spieth, three times winner of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the ants, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team reversed a disadvantage of four points before singles, although Furyk's team, holder of the title, only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "no thinking" to untrustworthy unilateral disarmament
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating mistrust with the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed with our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea would be rewarded as it made gradual steps, its statements appear significant insofar as they do not absolutely reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to achieve a formal end to the war in Korea from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive way, opposing itself until "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been mentioned by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party concerned on this issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korea's rockets towards US territory was inevitable after Mr. President Mau' Trump called Kim the "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to " utterly destroy" North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but stated that much still had to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have a timetable for this, stating that "it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously until the denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and declared that he would visit Pyongyang again in the coming month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes corresponding measures".
Pompey said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were the security assurances taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machist culture of studying in "direct" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often had no idea of the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes he is the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course emerged after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect to bed.
In another section participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct doing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep enough and quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, and even to avoid fattening, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hungry mode, constantly making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the whole campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Gol de Menga overthrows Gerrard's men
Rangers had another access to sadness outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarranged team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The team of Ibox sought to record their first victory in their journey since the triumph of 1-0 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up defeating Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga marked seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers' collective, uninspired, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers now coming down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, and just behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
And more problems may arise for Rangers after the Calum Spence line attorney has received treatment of a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor area.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that exceeded the Ayr in the half-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven Livingston who stole one point from Hearts last week, and has been delighted with the way his well-oiled team suffocated the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more to the one he had.
The team could have scored at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ball, but the average wasted his great opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish out towards the second trave.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in his game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a big penalty for the quarter of an hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but ref Steven Thomson refused Colombian appeals.
Rangers only got two endings to the balliza in the first part, but the old network guard of the Ibox Liam Kelly had little to worry about the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the weak end of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34th minute Livingston goal may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, however much less due to its tenacity.
Again, Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' long stop ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finalization.
Gerrard moved in the interval, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the lateral advance moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from its line to make the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett performing long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final phases, but McGregor took it well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow ended out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, again called for a great penalty when he was stranded in Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Almanaque "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is today 136 years old and continues to CONTAR ...the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, counter Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now he's breaking up!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave the name still lasts.

A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its change in laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer," including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-support diatribe with a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, claiming that he would run for the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his evening song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he started a beating against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How often I talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would've been leaving America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star broke out of Brett's testimony Kavanaugh before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the scene of West's beat was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to rip off West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a little bit behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They bullied me in the backyards.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "put on my superman coat, because that means that no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments caused a lot of audiences and the participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, and someone from the program told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of the song I Love it bottled Perrier.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: OBLIGED BY ENFRENTERS THE TURBA".
However, the interviewer Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "that's what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (purchasing his music or supporting his "art") who I believe is welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming it was now "or being previously known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change names, following Diddy's pasts, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing Prince musical legend changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder after stabling in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern Belfast area on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public ministry.
War Star Harington Kit Tronos attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a scriminist like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, War of Thrones.
However, the actor, aged 31, attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys feel that they often have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the War of the Rose Leslie Thrones, also aged 31, admitted that he has a "very strong position" as regards the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I believe that this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequeles or sequelae of the Tronos War when the series ended next summer, referring to the end of the "war fields and horses" for him.
As of November, Kit will participate in a True West edition of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne War.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series won with Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the property land of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, the health authorities said.
Approximately 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks "dangerous minds" and "theories of conspiracy"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and sites of the "ultraright".
" Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes allegedly the addresses of the households and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during an audience with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters Office and published data from a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"That suggests that she doesn't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not his responsibility, he cannot be angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
It must reveal calm and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday audience.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will dispute Waters' place in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," read on his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent claims.
"We ensure that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Back to Attack - weak spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and it seems to apply in fact to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire on the subject of being so bad the new export opportunity to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes pierced and an excessively elastic expression obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, which is a comprehensive comical creation destined for non-English cinematics.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a pitty of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with one note to the theme of the film "Glory Moments" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In addition, his character was originally based on international travel and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played on TV ads for Barclaycard, who left the chaos on his trail.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approached a helicopter with a medieval armor, with the rotor blades making a short noise of rail against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as 007 and impossible Missions now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is directed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always present, is that Britain is in a serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for consternation of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your secret service advisors inform you that, since all agents in the active are committed, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this person is the messy Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving non-official classes on how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us an academy of spies in the style of the film "School of Rock".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and to join again to his suffering helper Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a fuzzy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being dangerously fascinated by the charismatic billionaire of technologies that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssia of absurd acts disastrous: disguised as table-workers, they set on fire a well-known French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating as clandestine in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English triggers pure anarchy as it tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize itself with the interior of the home of Volta.
All stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but however friendly and stormy it is, the set has enough TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but question: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be pondering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek, but five-day payout.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, granting them an additional day of strike.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources point out that the idea of "adjusting" the party's economic programme, which reorients the country in favour of workers.
The passage to a four-day working week gained the favorable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favoured at this time by the whole of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the party said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the "faceless directors" and the "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the full share of current water companies shareholders, as the Labour Party may perform "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which can provide annual dividends that can amount to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can do them or not change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the findings can lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy showed up but open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett did a vigorous denial," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a list of extremely impressive stars that will work on an equally impressive mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Revado, not only to attend the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a telephone call or any other significant ways to increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of the Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "cliquetivism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have put pressure on it to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion for those already disbursed or pledged.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote to history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group further stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and crooked way - sometimes we fell and failed.
But just like the great movements for civil and anti-apartheid rights that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform this year's New York event, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the marine as "blocking" to put a stop to Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary," Washington can use its marine to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly where the legitimate government is invited, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they intend to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its marine capacity, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" North Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a Moscow "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will analyse deeply" the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020," said the Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will analyse deeply" the possibility of applying for the presidency following the interim elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as a maximum manager," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will look deeply into the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying "I was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal criticism of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that she should apply for the presidency by 2020.
59% of Massachusetts's "probable" voters stated that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
32% give their support to their candidacy.
The survey revealed more support than a candidacy of former Governor Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed regarding a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a run by Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his registration in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can identify myself with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with," said the public at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "turn a little different, come back hard, question if there is such respect for what his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a friendly statement curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the US authorities denied her asylum on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 Decision of the Board of Immigration Resources which allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle", read the statement amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the police ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear on the basis of ethnicity, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or with a given political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles a counter clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, the mother of a male February baby, by comforting him at an evacuation center in the razed town of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their watery belongings.
Hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulders, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimacy" with "advertising announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the supplement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most printed newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the elections of 6 November for Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocking an ever-increasing trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff vacancies on imports of the other.
China's retaliation rates at the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and North American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, he wrote Branstad in an opinion paper in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting foot in the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press."
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the keen American tradition of freedom of speech and press publishing a paid announcement in Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters before the interim elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may provoke a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the interim elections to take place shortly.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they want to move forward to a vote.
These things don't go back," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation is sufficient to appease the rebels.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Counselor and National Speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby, since Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the records," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without party affiliation.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly between the indecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the appointee to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
"This has become a joke for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take over his place as a judge. It's also about how Republicans have dealt with the subject and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first one.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they considered that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford mentioned under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had molested her sexually as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez argues that the appointee for the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when they were both participating in a party during the period when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online data storage", or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal ability through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators worldwide can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in where all your business models are turned from bird to bird from day to day.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: homage to the cleric decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in their city-natal for 100 years.
Lieutenant-Coronel Reverend Bernard Vann received the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons dropped a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brightly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that it gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and slaughter three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant-Coronel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know he could never equal, but also a lesson of humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the stop" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts awake all night to see Bellator 206 instead attend the Porca Peppa
Imagine this: It is awake all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 combats, with six of the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were amazed when the coverage moved to Pig Peppa.
Some were not impressed after having been awake until dawn especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad joke".
"Government regulations say that the content is not suitable for six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, the marketing and communication managers when asked about the transmission.
"Pig Peppa," yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will rectify the schedule of broadcasts to include UK spectators in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But it's six a.m. Sunday morning there and we can't solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I am not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of combats to five instead of six, as we normally do. We have tried to exceed the expectations of fans and exaggerate.
It's a lamentable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about his sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley said that he grew up to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he entered high school that "they're not all like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was in favour of homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The long-standing regular presentationer, Kirsty Young, took a several-month strike due to illness.
appearing as a paria in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "inferior" to all the others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to describe homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daley married last year to Oscar's 20-year-old winner, although he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we pass so when we are so young" - their first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and the father died of cancer three years later - he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age as he went through similar heights and lows.
The couple had a son last June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all their perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was "get a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that you're not going to be here to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding him handless when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what my whole life had dreamed of: diving in front of a multitude of fellow countrymen at the Olympics... there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, of Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson down in shape at the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he fights his 47th match in a Ryder Cup, but he will have to get his way back to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and ants.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has often been in the U.S. teams, the five times winner of the main male championships divided the day between the support function and the work in their field game, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Having never hit the most straight at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf Nacional field, where the long rough usually punishes the errant spots.
And if the field alone wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, will face the necessary British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches by them this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 single matches, record a good start, Mickelson's departure can become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He totally understood the role he had today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who gave these teams a lot in the past, and so does this week.
I probably hadn't seen him playing two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday of the largest number of matches played at Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that never matched the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some tangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players have had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives much more than just play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage may disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose leadership by entering the last single day at Ryder Cup can easily become an injured tour.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a short time," Bjorn said, in the image, after having attended the 2018 Cup victory by 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So the story has shown me and everyone on this team that this has not finished yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go ahead and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled with the performance of its players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with it myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters are individual performances and that involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are fully tested.
This is the message that needs to be passed on to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they will abandon the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to make his players better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important departures tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, the pressure is very high in these midfields.
We organized our effective in accordance and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of attempting to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIllroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I believe it covers the entire journey," Bjorn said about his choices for singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War time. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failures and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was expected to have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include more dilated maintenance periods, which would allow sending the latest frigates on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have made it possible for warships of the last generation, considered as a way for Germany to design power beyond borders, to be out of date when they enter into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put her into service, returning her to the Blohm & Voss yards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the yard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial hardware and software defects that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the necessary contingent in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the marine to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-tonn "Rheinland-Pfalz" has twice the weight of vessels of similar classes used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached some amazing EUR 3.1 billion, an increase compared to the initial budgeted EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German Defence Parliamentary Committee, acknowledged that the Navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands in order to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long ear chestnuts and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the activities of bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The expert analysis of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its territorial behaviors.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the conservation of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affect dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightnings are also a threat, along with the moss-moss papers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, dormitory inspections and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, on the Threeave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threeve we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about bats that we do not know, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us know more about what they need to flower."
It emphasized the importance of checking whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity ward can lead to the death of up to 400 young females and animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was said by her: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply do not know how their populations are taking revenge."
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of rape when his lawyers prepare to prosecute German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that you will then pay $375 000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read on Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of five Gold Balls to the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which have characterized as "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for moral damages in the amount of the serious infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they found themselves in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where the player raped her annually, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that he was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian Juve giants in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will repent forever" from losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in the car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also said that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer reported that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that, if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will be watching production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Executive Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about EU exit without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said he would close his Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit with no agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the parts to be reached every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for order-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border, which the sector says may lead to delays and scarcity of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "accurately balanced to avoid these checks at the border".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement to allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use of this opportunity for us," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it could not provide an estimate of stopping time, Toyota said that, in the long term, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union union in that place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesperson said "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "done another week" given that there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's advisers and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing for the dismissal of the Deputy Attorney General, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fuelling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of depositing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations, in New York.
Trump said he would rather not say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was then delayed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation lasting a week on the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press adviser, Sarah Sanders, participated in the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
I always like keeping the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like protagonistism."
He then realized that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We analyze these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, "but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do so frequently and have seen that we have done so in the last few weeks, and that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions on leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, on receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes strange manner before the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the departure of the United Kingdom of the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to costing the applications for EU citizens resident status who work in the decentralized public services of the country.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal have continued and decisions are expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want a lot of them to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injuries
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after head injuries in the defeat of Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tigers.
The coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the side line and practically fainted," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before lying on a maca and transporting it for further evaluation.
A representative of the team told Chris Harris of the WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/ severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five placards on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total of the season to 18 placards.
A higher seal tax will be levied on foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to collect a higher seal tax to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless
The measure will neutralize Corbyn's success to attract the younger electorate
The increase in seal tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
A higher rate of seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to homeless, today will announce Theresa May.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises of making accommodation more accessible and taxing higher incomes.
The increase in the seal tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surcharge - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and rental purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that the measure will allow up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and hindering the access of first-house buyers to the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy emerges weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining the prices of high properties by landfilling which they do not use, requiring Mrs May to abandon the quotas on affordable dwellings to solve the "hate of housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "no justification".
He also wants to assign extended powers to the municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a house for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of your house has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep at rest remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
The coach at Sunderland Jack Ross said that his "last ambition" is to become a picker for Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the club in the northeast, currently third in the First League, at three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division at the past time.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalization B," Ross told BBC's Sportssound program.
"I grew up to see Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former coach says he didn't feel afraid to happen to such consecrated names in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the moment the success is summed up as "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll just consider I was successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the title of champion at the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking into account the Alloa "was a real crusade," remember.
"I've always seen myself more in the coach than in the player's role.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the position, but I feel very well as a coach.
I always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I have ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 a.m. Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of the restaurants decreased 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good time and career at the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made the June standard, in which the pubs recorded a growth of 2.8% in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a retreat.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restaurant in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the business based on the drinks had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the descent of the restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose 6.6% during the month, with meals receding 3%."
Paul Newman, from the analyst of the leisure sectors and RSM restoration, said: "These results extend the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is no surprise that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell whether the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing down of the release of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the sector's benchmark.
One in five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in five children - some only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in social networks that hide parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of the "false" pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some only 11 years of age - creates accounts on social networks that hides adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on Instagram's photo sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students said they had an innocuous "principal" account to show their parents, while holding private accounts simultaneously.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found out that Teenager was urging others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most successful Scottish athletician medalist. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world-wide community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from his presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute truly to help guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre tests at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, has stopped walking after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It was a month ago that I suffered from a stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell you to recover and to what extent.
It's been a tough job but it's achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk and I've already done agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Announcement of pump milk extraction compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A dairy pump company divided the online opinions with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed cows in the ordeha.
To mark the launch of that one described as the "first portable silent pump of milk extraction", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by musical videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled vacay to the sound of a song that includes verses like: "Yes, I'm ordering myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The saying goes, "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying that it lightens the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Three decisions to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to producing milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after they were born," wrote a spectator.

Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone also said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious."
"I think the idea is great.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy but makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like "cows".
It's not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk from bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly within a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, grab their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a headline.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded in the walkway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children reached a peak, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult to patrol children.
Traditionally, most "fathers" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering themselves to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to record their fingerprints, and the data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the service held dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the fathers or members of their family aggregates are illegal in the country, many of them being foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr.Albence.
By seeking to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules which require some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, in accordance with the previous rule, with the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present for videoconferencing, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to children's disturbances being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say good-bye to friends aggravates the trauma with which many have already been discussed.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the American, French and Turkish "forces of occupation"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the House.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions still displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were guaranteed, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last great rebel bastion of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staff of Mixture, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited "to the review of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals will end their presidency in advance.
What would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of an ever-presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of spectator tiredness.
Since 2014, the high-time audiences have doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in noble hours, a rise due to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's program "Designed Survival", about a head of office who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him I was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has value for entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programmes, stories from Washington may determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet, it is more than being an informed citizen when we are watching at the sixth hour a debate of experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather blouse ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s scurvy descriptions of... um... President Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he has done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's dynamic cast and the daily turnarounds of the ring (along with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episodes or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, watching MSNBC while I was recording CNN.
He did not defuse television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness before the Senate's Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania knows a flow of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race for the same place.
The recent readjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburg put in the race the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb candidates against another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favour the Republicans.
The race through the 17th circle sparked a bitter dispute over the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangent victory in the extremely disputed March extraordinary elections to the 18th electoral circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
USA considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauru, spokesperson of the State Department, said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this country of Central America with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, officials at the top of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue ahead, putting aside all and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked in mid-October, in a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal proceedings covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst near the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation into whether Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility from that body, while preparing to re-approach to the voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
They are a lot of hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make from both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officials were prepared to testify to Hitler in a coup d'état, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the carnage years that followed.
The course of history revolves around inflection points like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are currently facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says the news of The Times is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress responsible for Mr Trump?
If we dive into these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on that table with the swastika.
With an inheritance of these, how could I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the optimistic Rangers before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in good position to qualify in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the pairing two goals with the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We took the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but overall, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the trains are doing well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past time and achieve success."
Women are losing their sleep out of fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of the kind of care they wanted to take, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance industry.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care for them if you don't let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
It involves your financial consultant: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Its choices for the financing of continuing care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover such expenditure or financing using its own savings, provided that it has these values available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care provider, choosing a person from their confidence to supervise their health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a prosecutor's office on his finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become disabled.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Includes this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only financial issues are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Men shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the age of forty, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in her chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Wounds do not involve life-threatening and the police have asked for witnesses.
earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported the authorities, hoping that the number of dead could increase.
With the interrupted communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dojaga region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dojaka on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dojaka is a region that extends along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with a lower administrative status than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities in the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dojaka.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dojaka were struck by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dojaka.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dojaka in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, which is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, originated a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes reached the western coast of Sumatra, in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that fell on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, depolating a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes have reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is previously detained in the pre-trial detention centre of Mat-Su, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously, innocent," reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to a penalty of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Court of Veterans.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a domestic violence crime and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of scratching her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' associations after associating the violent behavior of the child with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude earthquake 7.5 originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks were cut off, expecting the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake reached the region of Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
They broadcast videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Ministry calls for rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York Public Ministry calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October, on a cycle on West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification calling for the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges may be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder in the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor's Office in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "considerable planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov executed him as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade now, the South Zone of New York has not been asking for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted by conspiracy to commit spying acts in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documentation of the court, Saipov, who is a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also applied for permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police reported.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense attorneys, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the defendants not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Euroceptics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Backward Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have already left" if Farage were Minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionaries was emphasized by conservatives who defend the permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The first administration has been debating itself to maintain its commitment plan, known as the Czech Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit’s partisans, the defenders of stay and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Euroceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave at Solihull that he intended "to end the plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain is completely unobstructed."
The Conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Czech Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who carry the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Checklist Plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a question of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not gonna get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and rule itself."
However, the defenders of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists posted tracks with the message "Conservators Against Brexit" after the release of the group this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
"These are people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'More Canada', for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to "put seriously" the possible candidacy of the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "seriously put the candidacy to the President" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-commander of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you can face Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump's takeover.
One of the participants asked whether he was planning to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed near the campus of Southern University in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at his head, after which he ended up dying," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence on the spot, placing a gun, recognizing he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a junior of 1.98 meters created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was held for 10 times in the past season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first in boxing and made Hamilton have to face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one more time later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton exceeded it after a reneided squaramouça, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the internal part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, exchanging tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to end in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxes on the 44th round but couldn't improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me over him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday due to his insistence that he did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee of Justice, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, see the anger, see how bad people are, malicious and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks of information and the releases and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape leave you?
Do you remember her answer... did you disclose the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't go away from me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape left us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday night's debut: "You know more, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the appointment to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in their favour.
"They are determined to regain power through all means.
We see wickedness, wickedness, it doesn't matter who can get it, who has to step in to take over power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat by Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were redeemed from the defeat on Friday at the First Division against Belfast Giants, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday, in Dundee.
The Giants gained an initial advantage of two goals with endings from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the house team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald guaranteed the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had managed a revolution on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In a first frenetic period, Sullivan re-placed the house team in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cowie at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants to reach the first interval in leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The house team reorganized and Bouchard tied up again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to overwhelm the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Générale refused to leave his post while the control tower was violently waving at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower, in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Navigation Agency, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television chain ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We've been devastated by this news," he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donjaka, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting help and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being taken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, in charge of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia’s President, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he went to the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Early this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took the lives of more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a missing man after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that, since Saturday afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company said it was collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for disclosure of further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The official authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and loved it in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming very low.
"It was the best that ever happened," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the belt and reach the plane's emergency exits to sink.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and began to scream, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working in a work of improving a spring in the vicinity also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sank to 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with recorded PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its claims on Saturday at the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that your phone was with Chambers at the time you claimed to have been with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruence in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"You paid her out of your life," said Hale.
The defence should begin to present its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
Bristol's High Breed group states that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fleets and Commons have seen a recent rebirth in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
Nanny of New York processes couple for dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New York nurse is processing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she's got a mother's text message by mistake to complain that she was "one more black."
The couple denied the charges of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new nurse Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE... MORE A BLACK," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he noticed his gaffe, a "chance" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the previous Afro-American nurse and who was waiting for a Filipino nurse.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the couple and asking for a redundancies of 350 USD/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show you that you can't be unpunished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't really mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated badly, even by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
By calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said that his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the legal process takes place, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers might not identify themselves with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to put ourselves in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to get to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to play writing the children's book, would not have led to his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had a bitter taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described himself as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his success.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we're proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to my phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been taken from emergency to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The drugs that the doctors had given you to keep your heart working were slowly giving up and leaving your system.
He'd been dead a while ago and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for her daughter's loss, embarked on the plane along with other passengers outside the proof that she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always picked low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women place cards on deck to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said it illuminated the room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "diving in darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "to know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, or be a friend.
Don't shut yourselves up.
Kelly Humphreys, a long-time friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, shortly after the mother-in-law died.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in your behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something that has to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the beginning of the FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms of what I had asked for - a time and scope investigation - we could become more united," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, pointing out that I was afraid that the committee would be "disrupting" in the face of an entrenched party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporary issue.
The interim elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom she met Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI file your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where they currently have 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast the vacancy vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreases during the Kim regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has decreased since the rise to the power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
In citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 2011.
Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal and non-refugees, and is often repatriated.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they generally agreed to collaborate in the creation of a Korean denuclearized peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all links of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a strict and solugent voice, when talking about her family and her high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the commission, calling the allegations made against him of "crotesque and conspiracy murder" organized by angry Liberals by Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
He said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no ability to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behaviour against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
When asked whether he would attempt to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or to the FBI, you don't meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the D.C. District Reporting Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh's potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the fame of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of revoking certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and preconceived to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women must be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatric, months and years of fury to tranship, and it can't break down without crying.
"We salute when we get pissed," Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem strange to me, does it?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me enormously. She told me that she also cried when I was angry, but she had created a technique. When I was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job dominated by men in whom he was crying of inexpressible rage, being held by his neck by an older woman - a nothing friendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy they got you affected."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time of the Colorado Democratic Congressman, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-marital relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fundraiser was beyond the desirable and swore that it would only enter the race if it could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters only gave him $250, although they had given him $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I have the right to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fund-raising and bring the message to the voters, instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears emerged.
"Even seemed to be depressed," said Patricia Schroeder talking about the media's reaction.
"I thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How trade war between the US and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the U.S. and China was insurgent, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of the experts, the departure of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year to tax important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week was the stage of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), actually charging half of all goods sent by China to the United States.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising the rates of 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will hesitate in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but showing a public subservice to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated for more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe hits the U.S. and wins Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats in European soil since the last victory of Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe was once again crowned victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who showed that he had serious difficulties during almost all the tournament, threw the tea starting for the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst rated player in the selection of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-class player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England where he may have been his last stake in Ryder Cup.
One veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I can't contain myself.
It was a tough year.
I can't help thank Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad we beat the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotion Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He speaks to his fellow countryman Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the American Gulf, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up to see him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and just hit by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed for reaching the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we were able to put some fear into Europe.
We fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize ourselves and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move on.
I like many of these 12 players and am proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat off the other team.
They were better."
