The former head of the Brazilian presidential office is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential office for alleged involvement of it in a massive corruption scheme on the Petrobras state oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu will be sued for the charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other thirteen people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Labour Party in government taken into custody for the links with this scheme.
Dirceu served as head of office of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August of his home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors stated that Dirceu developed the Mitigment Scheme from Petrobras, accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the vote scandal purchased.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in the form of bribes and other illegal funds.
Some of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribes to directors Petrobras in exchange for inflated contracts.
The “miraculous” recovery of a survivor student of the Peshawar massacre
A teenager paralyzed after being shot four times in the worst terrorist attack in Pakistan was able to recover “miraculous” after treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years of age, the doctors in Pakistan had told him he would never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be later released from the hospital.
Exactly nine months ago, in the usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed was sitting at first aid hour and listening to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men dressed in the uniforms of security officers entered the public school of the army.
They wore belts with explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women and children on their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, screaming him.
He said, "Oh, man, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of the people who were killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the blue down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then those in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest in my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his legs again.
They campaigned and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of famous people like Imran Khan, a crichet player becoming a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The consultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "afraid" when he arrived at the hospital.
“He had spent his last few months lying in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other, ” says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertebrae at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in his shoulder, hip, and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during an operation that lasted six hours, Malik and his team managed to reconnect the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just one week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and going.
We weren't expecting such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to walk again
He wants to become strong and to continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, to join the army and to fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance to live," he says, showing pictures with weapons drawn by him near school manuals and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but psychological trauma through which he passes and now is unimaginable.
"My fury has not fallen," he confesses.
In my school little kids were killed.
What murder did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, comforts him, and says: “I see my son walking again. ”
He'll be able to continue his life.
Three Super Voice 4G Service provides better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Three mobile phone provider has launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and in rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over-Term Evolution (VOLTE)".
It only works currently with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the months to come.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: "By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than before."
The sights prepare for the pantomime traineeship
The pantomime station is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them preparing for this year's internship.
Now, at the Christmas theater, they're taking part in some of the biggest names in the showbusiness.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and second in the role of the fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I don’t do anything, I feel guilty ”
Steven Wilson was recently appointed the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most professional musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three prizes at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a clever, expressive and captivating art opera".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several musical projects, the most famous being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at the Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyl and his loaded program and explained how comedian Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era and I remember that I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a disc, going home with him, having a scratch and you had to bring it back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than wines.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing else to really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
There's something you can hold in hand, while you're absorbed by lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but there's no way it could be if kids too young to remember wine like this kind of experience.
Do you have any wine you especially hold on to?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyl in the '90s.
All the wines I bought are bought again.
I started with the idea of restoring the collection that I was 15 years old, but I passed that limit.
The first record I convinced my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for Disk Shop Day, but I missed the opportunity.
My record house had suggested collecting some of my shortest and most accessible songs.
I became easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I necessarily kept the project being launched only on the vinyl.
Whoever buys the vinyl also receives a downloaded variant at high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music, there's one thing I've always valued above anything: the musical part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses rather on technical complexity than on the musical side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, has passed the time test because they have always put emphasis on the music and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall shows?
I don't want to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
In the first, it will be a version of the Hand. Erase show that I had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will be rather an incursion into my history, being more oriented towards the fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the second night?
And me and the others on the tour team are big fans of [the comedy show on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we give all the time quoted from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music too, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our shared love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You remixed albums of troops like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I am not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I was working at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
That's how you feel?
You can remove the word progressively.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that proudly, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly strong work ethic.
If I don't do anything a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remix work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a tough place to make your career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy I don't think I would have survived.
Transience will be launched in the United Kingdom on September 25.
Steven Wilson will play at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September as part of his European 2015-2016 tournament.
A new contract brings back jobs to Skytrans
The new Skytrans re-employed some of the airline staff who had lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the restored company in northern Queensland, helped with a $25 million contract to transport employees to the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members have recovered their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that formed a large part of the airline business.
The bankruptcy made many communities face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliamentary for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, CEO of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to re-engage 18 Skytrans staff members with full standards, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for CGC customers.
In just five months, we've grown up with 100% work force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans’s flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves the Head of York and Torres Strait, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights a week for QGC staff and entrepreneurs from Brisbane to Chinchilla and Taroom locations, in its 36-seat Dash-8 planes, starting on Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of the CGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tendering procedure.
"We are delighted that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentary and fresh mother Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a larger supply of milk to avoid missing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a larger supply of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding taking part in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's head of discipline, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what the most appropriate approach is for a breastfeeding parliament, in accordance with the current orders.
Liberal Parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
According to the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - mothers who are breast-feeding get a vote in Parliament.
That means their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption before he consulted the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things rushed on two occasions, when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked whether the parliament was planning to make a larger milk supply instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentary of Queensland, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources by Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the Higgins division representative was furious when he was told to make a larger reserve of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the creation of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, Liberal National Parliamentary of Queensland, was promoted as responsible for the discipline of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censoring motion test of February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in the image of Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The former head of discipline, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censure by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed deputy head of discipline.
Nickolic had recently kept the newspaper's front page, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to refuse to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
It is one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The spokesman for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said on Wednesday that voting power for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"She is now [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The head of discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said on Wednesday that he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," said the Prime Minister in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included only one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after re-engineering in December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, publisher at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobbying groups in the business sector did not know how to show greater enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's siblings as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he had just come into a suspended negotiation because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke at unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy the public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do things well.
So what exactly does the country's largest companies and their representatives expect from our new Prime Minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull itself established the free trade agreement with China as its starting point.
In his first speech in which he announced on average that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized the "revolting outbreaks of economic shock" by the Labour Party on that issue and expressed concern about the racist attempts of critics.
"In the context of CHAFTA, winners are numerically more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, a legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and negotiate with the whole senate.
Small Business Minister Bruce Billson supports Harper's recommendations.
This could lead from the outset to certain differences with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply to large mergers and other contracts, in order to decide whether consumers will have to suffer due to the lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions, but also the effect that they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
The Harper competition law analysis recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to move smaller operators out of the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the major retailers.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
The CAA jumped to say that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of Harper's analysis, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one who advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by leaving Bruce Billson, the minister for small businesses (which is on the side of Harper's recommendations) to support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women aged between sixty and eighty years.
Those who mainly eat plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their "significant" probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative figure in the Empire said for Rolling Stone magazine that he does not believe that one time he is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If one makes one, it means that two has no value, since once it has no effect.
One time I do two, because the square root of his four is two - so what is the square root of his two?
There should be one, but we're told there's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers did not agree with his theory, so he gave up the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics called "Terrryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassessing scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one time" and other similar theories.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "the most complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures linked to copper wire or magnetized.
Howard says, among others, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 (‘The enhanced brick systems and methods of applications’).
Also, the actor in "On the tracks of an idol" also says Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "crazy" if they saw Terry.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking myself since I was three-four years old why does a bubble form round?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard also added that he hopes to change the entire course of learning.
“This will be the last century in which our children will learn that one by one make one,” he said.
They won't have to grow up in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that one time I do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Printing
Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star played little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then showing her vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Bigo's name was still in the press.
On the same day he was also at Good Morning America, where he opened the show with the gogoashe line incident.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants where they will be served will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the fast food chain in Mexican style will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a menu of tapas of appetizers, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the chain’s “Taco Bell Cantina” restaurants, which are addressed to young people, concentrated more and more in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has almost 6,000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell payment of 7 USD, the company used drive-through service and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell says that, in order to address the new generation that "looks for more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can make a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"You're not allowed," said US F.T. TODAY Neil Borkan, Frenchman Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you will see the food yourself" before it is ready," said Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served at the new location, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nightly" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an inner court and a sales window.
These location changes, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food chain of restaurants also wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality food line in 2012, when he opened more expensive Cantina and burritos menus, to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he intended to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be the "Cantina" type.
They lit the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John is making Putin's yard
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John, Monday night, just a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet with the Russian politician to discuss with him the old Russian legislation.
The British song, declared homosexual, successfully tried to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, during a tense period in the history of this state, after adopting controversial laws, which prohibit "gammon propaganda" in the ranks of minors.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement to the fans: "Although I'm gay, I always felt I was welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about what I was, I couldn't compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist devalued that he wanted to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "song" all in the ANRP file
The businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a burning conviction, "sing" in front of the judges and detailing how he distributed millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Hearing yesterday at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which he is tried with his son or Alin Cocos, by the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and by former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensation in ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges in detail how he helped the businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of the compensations from the ANRP, instead asking to be judged faster and to take into account his collaboration.
Cocos thus showed that he knew Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he engaged with it after more real estate business.
He stated that Sergiu Diacomatou met in 2010, and he told him he was working at the ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at the ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told him I'd give him in several trances.
I also promised him political support, to remain in office.
"Diacomatou told me then that he helped me, but that he needs support," Dorin Cocos pointed out in the courtroom.
He also said that later, through a knowledge, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Compensation Commission, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatou already had political support, I also gave him five million euros.
I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros to Dumitrean.
I'm stating that all this money was giving her the trance to make sure the file was settled.
"That's what I said to them: to solve the file, to pay off," Cocos said.
Asked why he got to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"We've never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also showed that "it was notoriety that all the members of the ANRP understood before the meeting."
I wasn't nervous that they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatou political.
"I told him that I only help him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Bridge brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file "Turceni - Rovinari".
Victor Ponta fled the DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the scope of the file where he is researched for false in inscriptions under private signature, complicit in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although the documents they could have been sent by lawyer.
It wasn't like that, since the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left for the record several documents.
I wanted to file the European Court of Justice decision of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I'm saying we've been active, the prosecutor says we haven't done, the European Court of Justice told us to see about both of us, because, as long as the fees are paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all the countries of the European Union, we have no case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on the exit of DNA.
Ponta also said that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call him back to the hearing, but also give him an answer to his requests, including the deletion of the file.
Johnis enjoys his mandate without a TV
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is assumed that the president of Romania's position is also part of the connection to everyday realities.
President Iohannis plunged into total silence in his office or from Cotrocenes every day
Only, to the surprise of his closest people from the Cotrocene Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after he doesn't watch TV - at any program, at least at German posts RTL or Pro Sieben - the president doesn't listen to any radio stations and doesn't read any newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
On the other hand, Johnis was happy to receive only the report with the news that put him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-insulation, in which the only breach is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passivity, the head of the state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although he's been so bitter for so long since his installation in function, Johnnis hasn't yet signed the declarations of loyalty of more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both humanly and legally.
Silence and peace
Those in the presidential environment are already clear to them that no one and nothing can ruin the "feng shui" of the head of state.
Where is quiet and peace.
What's right, only after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when Sibi's former building demands the presence of officials.
A habit that probably didn't dissipate from the time he was driving the city's primary on Cibin.
And the fact that Iohannis does not want television in his office has already been born countless legends, being already people from the Cotrocene Palace who have come to bow to the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially because he doesn't have any radios.
Only at this rate will it be possible to meditate as soon as possible in the dark, because the lighting devices can hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just for good.
Also another weirdness at the Cotrocene Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "pzoitative monitoring" of the president's activities.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the chief of state will receive his content on the biorus.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was prohibited to "negative monitoring" in conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night television broadcasts in which he was criticized, but he asked every morning, with priority, for negative news.
That doesn't mean the guest like he helped him, but, speaking of which, the gesture matters!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Neither outside nor confirmed
Now, eventually I love her and the mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Iohannis on TV.
By then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in charge and which must also bear its signature.
Only since December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation of at least half of these statements, although this was to happen in at least 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotrocene Palace have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the chief of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be fired.
Only that all of them didn't get the negative opinion!
So, in other words, I can come whenever the Court of Auditors inspectors, who will find that over half a year, hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That until he decides and the president if he fires them or confirms them on the posts, his decision being strictly his.
Authorities said that a teenager was planning an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States.
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francisc during his visit to the United States was rather “aspiratory order” than operational, confirmed on Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15 - year - old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when the law enforcement authorities laid off the plan.
The plan is the same as Texas Representative Mike McCaul, the President of Internal Security, during an interview given on Sunday, told a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week".
Pope Francisc was not referred to as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
the common information of the FBI and the Department for Internal Security of 14 August, in which the teenager was said to plan to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, with the target “a foreign dignity during a high-level event”.
The bulletin mentions that the minor has been radicalized through social networks.
It is possible that the adolescent suffers from a mental illness, told the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without providing accurate details about the young person's illness.
On Sunday, McCaul also recognized the potential for an attack by a so-called “sunistic wolf” at the level of the whole nation and noted that it was informed by the Secret Services about a “strictly secret location” for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a high risk of security... but as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
Skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree has suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
Collooney's bean, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, lighting up the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monument Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering a frightening story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services for FoxNews.com.
At the top of the chest there are knife wounds. There is such a trail in his left hand, which suggests that he is trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't know if he was killed in battle or in a personal argument," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably he was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said to FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents proving that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) have spent nearly $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, called "The way babies and young children perceive food" is carried out by the University of Chicago and so far it has established that young people are not prepared to eat soft food from other people or other people.
According to the project funder, “adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritional diets”.
There is evidence that the first food models of babies and young children have lasting consequences for the health of the whole life.
The premise for this study is that there is a lack of research into the way babies are concerned with food.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, child development psychologists have taken a surprising look at the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, said the financier.
The current proposal applies cognitive development methods to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the field of food."
Children aged between three and six years “know more about food than babies and young children”, but they are “extremely mofturous consumers”.
An actress who played “Star Trek: Voyager” is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played the TV show "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in the east of Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41 years old, who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two indecent exposure crimes involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3, at the home of Lien in Harriman, where they say they found it empty under a blanket on the couch.
Officers said Lien refused their requests to dress up.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien has been brought several counts of charges, including the aggravated bodily injury after the April incident in which he says that Lien entered a police car with his own car.
He still doesn't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the killed victim found in the Epping Forest
A man whose body in decay was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On September 9, Hidir Aksakal, 53, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in north-eastern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties with the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and detectives say his body was probably several weeks away in the Epping forest.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan Police, said: “Mr. Aksakal was well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information that will help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and crowded tourist resort, where there is a café and a lake for boat rides.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area for the past few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and talk to us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jog Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director Marissa Mayer announced that she was pregnant with twins, but he was going to take a very short maternity leave and “work” during his spare time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But can Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, be blamed for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, an attorney and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, had just obtained a job in the government at Washington DC a few years ago when her boss surprised her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, you can pick up your leave from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't receive a single day's maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
About that time, Patel was married and very focused on his career, and his family was the last thing he was thinking about.
But he listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had closed three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when he was born the second child, Patel could no longer implement the same strategy.
The four months off he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of work.
“ I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family, ” she says.
Send a message: your country doesn't put any value on that you will become a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any female employee who is and mother must be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling between mother quality and job as “a constant battle”.
The secret to not scuba diving is to have an "unbelievable family next to you" and a doll and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that you won't be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at interior fixtures") and simply go through this.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes it an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child's sick, he's got fever, he's puking and you're staying up all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry, after university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up the job, then start again don't have the same chance at top pay posts properly, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long run the results are seen. ”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move on is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example to her four children is what motivates scientific researcher and Professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
Children know their mother is helping save lives on her own.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says that it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" as regards career and fulfill it.
It's very important that women think they can have a vision.
Most of them don't let themselves believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials in Italy during a webinar, when she was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after taking her children or answering an e-mail on her way.
The Jonglet between motherhood and a applicant career was helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to an end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, aged 33, the Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that to make maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as bonuses, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or winning the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the deficient health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't take care of each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while taking law school courses, gave birth to her baby while she was receiving her scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on medical care offered by the scholarship, the labour leader was able to take a maternity leave of only two weeks and then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day-care services from companies, maintain the programmes established by common agreement and accept that efficient work does not mean staying over the programme.
In the front of logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is the additional pressure to activate in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mummy coat" is one of the most serious insults).
“ Imagination is part of our job, or pulls you down, ” she explains.
Mosko's "permanent negotiation" for its multiple roles to function harmoniously means keeping its appearance ec and a beautiful bag in hand, of which, however, sometimes a toy-two falls.
If he remembers that men are fathers too, society could allow women to do more.
People do not judge men that they are not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who deals with housing of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that motherhood and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks more like a swinger," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant leaving early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (' cheaper than therapy') still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create a "parent friend" environment, in which a child's lateness is allowed, and the response to e-mails should not necessarily be sent from the office.
"The concept and the concept of family have changed and is changing a lot," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what was 25 years ago or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Russian humorous say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it wasn't true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which the Russian leader thanked him for addressing him about the problem, it immediately became clear that, whoever called him on Monday night, certainly wasn't Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he did not know about that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humores admitted that they, not the president, were the foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became the spokesman of President Dmitri Peskov.
“But it seems that Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought it was really a conversation with the people we were giving us,” he said for Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day. ”
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most delightful of my life.
In order to complete John’s awkward situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the speculations of the prank.
Based on the story, the comments that the singer made on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridiculous" attitude towards homosexuals while militating for LGBT rights in Kiev, especially a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
“I would like to meet [at Putin], to talk to him,” said John for BBC, saying that although the idea was “probably unrealistic, it was still worth an attempt.
Then, Monday evening, the singer sparked the mistrust of observers when he posted a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking his phone and calling him.
He said that “he was looking forward to meeting [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately for John, it was not Putin at the end of the other line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone calls given to many celebrities and Russian and Ukrainian politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English well, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told the journalists that Putin would "be prepared to meet Elton John and answer all his questions," but that at Kremlin there was no such request from the singer.
Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English.”
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with the same grammatical mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared its prank public, the local media already suspected John was the victim of a joke.
Some users in the online environment had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the phrasing made to politicians with phones they record and post on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls in jokes to public, then publishing recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent of making them pranks to Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Geraschenko, the direct counsellor of the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Geraschenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections that led to massive street protests after massive fraud reports.
Given the position of Arkadi Dvorkovich, then President's adviser, Dmitri Medvedev, convinced President Vladimir Churov that Medvedev was planning to fire him.
In addition to many Russian celebrities, his victims included former President Mihail Gorbachev, Mayor of Kiev and champion of Vitali Klitschko and Russian Minister of Sports Vitali Mutko, who tricked him to apologize for drinking his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukașenko, giving himself the son of the Ukrainian leader laid down, Viktor Yanukokovici.
It was so convincing, that the person at the end of the other, whose voice resembled Lukașenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not disturb Putin with such an "irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people a year die prematurely because of air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burning for heating houses and cooking, but research reveals that such an alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the United States, where it is the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should trigger an alarm signal for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research has not included the effects of indoor air pollution, e.g. from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause 3.4 million more deaths per year.
The new study, published in Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel power plants and other sources.
Researchers used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to evaluate the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how they affect pollution on Chinese and Indian inhabitants.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for the heating of dwellings or cooking, and of the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of these are recognised dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India’s 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China’s 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, the research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a "significant" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which conducted the research.
One fifth of the global deaths are caused by these emissions, which mainly come from cattle, birds and pigs and from over-use of fertilizers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main cause of deaths due to air pollution from eastern USA, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the power plant, in particular by those operating with coal, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the United States it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55 000 deaths per year, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused almost a fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, accounting for 92% of deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The supposition between the high degree of pollution and the large number of inhabitants speaks to them about public health, but there is no longer any knowledge of the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
Currently all particles are supposed to be as toxic.
But if those caused by fuel burning are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and political leaders."
Dr. Oliver Wild, a specialist in the atmosphere at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really underlines the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia.
A statement by Victor Ponta also tenses more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister talks about attitudes that remind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a fence at the border with Romania, after that at the Serbian border, have experienced a new depreciation following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities from Budapest on Monday that he treats refugees "with bat and inserted".
Hungarian diplomacy has reacted hard when it comes to "extremist and lying" claims, but not even Victor Ponta has let himself down and accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
It should be noted that it is not for the first time that Ponta tries to tension the Roman-Hungary relations through declarations made in sensitive or electoral moments.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem you have of our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbours treat them, with their fists and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has been at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophob feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We're going to treat those people like us," Victor Ponta said on Monday, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the inclusion of refugees, but Chehia was recently in the center of critics after he wrote numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that rocked Victor Ponta's position make him make statements "extremist and lying".
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, informs Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the crisis of immigrants," says the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-ungary lies", stressed Budapest's diplomacy.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges that came from Hungarian government representatives - but read the story below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European man and citizen, about the attitudes and attitudes Europe has seen only in the 1930s-40s!", Ponta wrote on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European policies, he has "debt" to draw attention and punish "the constant behaviour of government officials of the highest level in Hungary" who are "a shame for the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-Semitistic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Arma ghimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in Europe's heart, there are policy decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees are fleeing!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially superior to European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in complete contradiction to these objectives and values!".
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject constituted Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if Hungarian soldiers caught and shot or killed children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
In the dispute, President UdMR, Kelemen Hunor, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "sentimental approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The UDMR leader says that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the Roman citizens, he points out that the fence could even help our country not become an intensive route transited by migrants who want to reach Schengen, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to stress, I mean, that we don't have to hysteria, take this whole thing as something against Romania and we don't have to use it to aggravate the relationships not too good between the two governments anyway, because that's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach, visceral is not okay.
"We have to see the rational part, see why we have come here and we have to know and say this, as it is not against us, it is not against Romania, it is against Roman citizens and it does not prevent free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored Russia's offer to remove Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia has proposed more than three years ago the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the West and the Russian Federation, The Guardian writes.
Finland's former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said that the Western powers have not taken advantage of the proposal since then.
Since 2012, tens of thousands have died and millions of others have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the worst refugee crisis since the end of the second world war.
Ahtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churchin, offered a plan that included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at a given time, following the initiation of the peace treaties between regime and opposition.
He proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way for Assad to retire," Ahtisaari said, reporting the Russian ambassador's position.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially supported Bashar al-Assad firmly over four and a half years of war, insisting that it cannot be a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military flight equipment to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenna 3's live internet program will be available at a cost
Antenna 3 informed viewers on Tuesday that from 1 November the program or live will be able to be viewed online against cost, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "sword to viewers", the news post of the Intact trust says that "we do this with a strong heart, wanting to stay with us and in this new stage, driven by market conditions".
According to that same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", television promising that the viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antenna 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news were and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which assumed a permanent retechnology and quality focus."
We managed to support ourselves, under the conditions that offline and online distributors did not contribute anything to the content offered.
The announcement comes under the conditions that the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscriptions and online platform Antenna Play, where, moreover, the most often exclusively accessible were the recordings of the antennas.
Reports show that populations of marine animals and plants have half-lived in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing animals and marine plants is documented in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a catastrophic decline.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions across the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a rush of difficulties for almost all marine life, says WWF's "Living Blue Planet".
Coral reefs are seriously at risk of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of commercially valued fish, such as macro and tuna, have dropped vertiginos by three quarters compared to the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction until the middle of this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate, as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing direct proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid from the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, a chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
"By overfishing, which damage coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we are like the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, and also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the London Zoo, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It investigated a wide variety of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and sea cucumbers - an animal similar to a worm, with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the algae areas decreased by about 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused enormous damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
There is a need for profound changes in order to ensure abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in species fishing for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to the Scrumbidae family - macro, ton and sardines - fell by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without giving signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, ZL Scientific Director, said: "These alarming figures show how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning about the problems we could face as a result."
Sea grass: deep underwater “pests” that catch rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the bottom of the sea.
During the last century, the surface covered decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
One quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate.
In-depth habitats: very little is known about the deep-sea areas, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the past 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former teammate from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography on "My Story" serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes Senegalese player saying that he is "not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years he spent at the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Futurs Medias Group, with cited translations attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked people of color".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought about by him.
In his latest book, Gerrard, who had previously made himself public and before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way in which he spat out a huge, ghastly phlegm in a Celtic fan in a Parkhead Egg Cup game in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and hateful behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most notorious night being Celtic Park.
The Senegalese foreman was interrogated by the police after the spit and fined with his salary worth of two weeks at the club, amounting to £60,000 being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard said.
I felt that he wasn't just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool come back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays the Malaysian Sabah club, criticized Gerrard in public and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf named Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield likes the player who led the team to the victory of the Champions League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is “zealous”.
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't achieve the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the status of chief, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and between the first 100 players of the century.
Many great players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am venerated, while Gerrard is chased away every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlats does not just play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, to an equal degree discreet and modern, tell producers.
"It has many categories and we always look for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, co-executive producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find himself impressed after that.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he was a competitor at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after taking a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, 22-year-old Skarlatos, a sentry in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may be anticipated some local evaluations - at Sacramento on Friday, there was a parade in the young man's favor - not expected so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years would I have thought I would receive this offer," said Skarlatos on Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show of Monday night he admitted that he was "easily moved," he worked as a professional at his first foxtrot, getting scores that brought him almost to the forefront of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and the executive producer at the "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for invited competitors over the last hundred meters, such as Skarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends who were on vacation, who fired a gun attack on a train of 500 passengers and immediately thought of inviting one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When it appeared at Good Morning America to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC's sister program to avoid passing through all media barriers.
He supported his "five-minute pledoria", and then waited eagerly to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz confessed.
A little while ago the fight in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he was interested in dancing.
Skarlatos, who is on a short leave from the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he did not want to be just highlighted.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their hands: Noah Galloway, war veteran, hand and foot amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan competitor and finalist of last season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably a critical point, along with Katz's unending “following up” and “the insistent messages,” she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be dressed and how the image of my friends will be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to get him to relax and give up his pretty rigid military position.
But Katz says she's confident that she'll adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the start, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To go further, he has to dance.
Skarlatos, who is bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that until now, he has had fun in this completely unknown environment.
The program was the hardest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the moments when it was acclaimed in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States right after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"That took about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in catching a person who attracts media attention, but it is not common to be in the light of reflectors, executive producer Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor manages and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want the participants to have a good experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alek ever to say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's keep his fists on having fun.
McRib from McDonald's back.
The time has come for those waiting all year long for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the country's McDonald's franchises offer this season speciality.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib's sandwich.
"At McRib’s 2015 promotion, approximately 8,000 restaurants are participating," McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb said for The Times in an e-mail.
In the United States there are just over 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," says McComb.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they consider their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is served (unaffiliated to McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
But a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib in Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones recordings would be prepared
Keith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, the other members of the Rolling Stones band might join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - recently met in London and made "clear plans for recordings", as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band was not inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representations at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
In the last of these, they reinterpreted the classic LP from 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, working with the documentary “Keith Richards: Under the Influence”, scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he also released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with guitarist: “As always, Richards’s harsh voice is a more kind than distinguished instrument.”
But Richards sparks emotion in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give further details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on Childhood, Maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them look much simpler than they actually were.
When a child actor on television shows such as "Silver Spoons" as an adult, he reaffirmed the role of an inexpressive typicalist in the television series "Situation of crisis" and in films like "Head of nightmare".
The first film he worked as director was the very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated for the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film he plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, as trouble brothers.
The film has as its subject a festival looking for American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic side, darker.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Premier of Monday night benefited from an introduction by the director of the festival's programme, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially with the sitcom "The Hogan Family" since the late 1980s and early 1990s, at which Bateman worked. "I haven't met too many fans "Hogan Family", said Batama sec when he got on stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Guild Directors at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has in the center a family named Fang.
The parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for how they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by setting up a bank robbery with acadelas or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is better known for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist trying to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter assume it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve into adult life has been reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
"It's a story that I feel connected to and I understand deep," he added, "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how this film should look to represent children with an untraditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she's the producer of the film, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was co-opted Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own piece "Treatment to Reality", in which Kidman played.
Batak confesses that he accepted the chance to film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in the premiere of months.
The reader of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" that "with the typhoids of the genre much too exploited of the dysfunctional family and dissects the mission, sometimes of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-loved, incisive and usually very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and mentioned that Batama "needs visible progress and maturity as a film director with this intelligent, structured but never too straight or mechanical adaptation".
After Monday's screening, when Bateman and Walken climbed the stage for the question session, the public evaporated it long on the Walken Multi-Tubbit.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which the film director's work, which is very difficult, and the actor's work in the scenes, was changing between them.
His concentration is indeed amazing.
In a certain stage of dialogue, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the shelter, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees himself more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to film," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to take advantage of me as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
Without counting that... actor wants a foreground.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the scenario, he immediately thought about Walker for Caleb's role, but also about the composer Carter Burwell for the soundtrack.
Known mainly for the long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalysa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters of Legend", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the soundtrack and for Todd Haynes' film "Carol".
"Works with elongated tones or obtuses seem very interesting," says Bateman, giving several explanations on Tuesday.
To navigate through those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one tone to the next, during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as a director, and as an actor, in a career dominated by reinventing and deciding, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished his film introduction to the world premiere of Monday, "Well, bad, he came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival wants that at Oscars about Boston Globe's investigation of the pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 to the lotto?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for one month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was bought from Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there were 16 other winning entries across Australia, which shared the unique prize fund of the X-Lotto of $4 million.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction X-Lotto 3555 Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
Additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, manager Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is looking forward to receiving good news that the one who won the big prize checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
“We have tried to spread the news out of power, for a person is our winner and has no idea at all,” she said.
Crimean detectives search the house on Beatell Street, Burton, where the last man Daniel Hind was seen missing.
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his journey the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd look into the house, I wasn't informed they'd do it," she said.
Ms. Hind also said that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have a lot of other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Whatever it is, we want it at home and put an end to the stories.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometres of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking in stolen cultural goods in the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was renewed to fit into the new context, focusing on banning cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for the Combating of Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed in the third place, after Italy and Greece, on the top of trafficking in objects and cultural goods.
Bulgaria's Minister of Interior has also shown that trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historic sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has expanded and is described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, said that films of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrate that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference recognized that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop illegal trafficking in cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funding from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal actions for rocket launches to Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the auction amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to defeat its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says that the Blue Origin engine program is about two years ahead of the AR-1 engine at Aerojet, an assertion that Aerojet contradicts it.
Work on new engines became a priority after American legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for launch of military or spy American satellites, after the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet tests engine hardware, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to match both the Atlas 5 ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that ULA develops and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet claims that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as it is currently considering ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funds from the Air Force in expected contracts at the end of the first semester of the fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
She also claims that the entire company was looking forward to seeing how the Air Force will share some USD 160 million in funding between rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was thinking of trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each of the tenderers must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Forces covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
The AB InBev brewing company intends a merger worth 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest brewing company in the world, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) with regard to a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine the domination of AB InBev' in Latin America with that of SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, as well as their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland told the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, world-class company and producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must happen not later than 14 October, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its marketing cost reduction policy, previously orchestrated the purchase of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A nearby source of the SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what it's gonna do, because they haven't received any offers.
"At this point, we are waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculations with regard to a merger, which would most likely cause concerns about the violation of competition rules in markets such as the United States and China, have been circulating for many years.
The moment of the approach, after more than a decade of purchases by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the SABMiller share price from August onwards.
"It's exactly the moment they expected," added analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) per SAB Miller share, maybe even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would also include the SABMiller debt.
This would do the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the sum of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases in 1980 here.
The SAB shares approached 19.9% to 36.14 pounds, giving him a $90 billion stock capitalisation.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivalii Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could look for another fusion as a defense strategy, as happened in the previous year when it offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottler with the Coca-Cola bottler (KO.N.), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination with Diageo or the Australian Coca-Cola Amatil beverage company (CCL.AX).
The overall quota on the beer market of AB InBev, the producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 211% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts from the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times since the present 2.5.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would be able to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought the company producing Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with USD 52 billion, the largest purchase of ice money in history at that time. allowed the report to grow to over 5 times.
Such a climb would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families that control AB InBev own a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the manufacturer of cigarettes Othera (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.
On Wednesday, Austria refused to make statements on the fact that AB InBev had been approached, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that it regularly assesses investment in SABMiller and that "this time we consider maintaining assets is in the interest of our shareholders."
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, Head of European Investment, Equity, at Allianz Global Investors, who has actions in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt incomes is about 15%.
However, we believe that the profit obtained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"Economics that could be done in distribution operations are large, and the obstacles related to the violation of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company's shareholding held by SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last offers for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesperson refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but Molson's actions increased by more than 12 percent to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the SABMiller's CR Snow partnership with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that after the collapse, the combined group could hold a 28% share of the global market.

Pakistani Police accuses a former Air Force pilot of aiding Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would subsequently donate funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said police officers for Reuters on Wednesday, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban soldiers at a hospital in eastern Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in a May attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and Ishmaelian minority, who died 45 people, said to the top police officer Navied Khawaja of the Department for the Combating of Terrorism of the province.
It will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has also funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial aid through his business or behind him someone else," said the officer.
"He also offered financial aid to AQIS," he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which are facing activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, Taliban rifles massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government vowed to suppress activism.
There have been severe attacks, while the army has also advanced more in tribal regions outside the border with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers from Pakistani cities that are under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years old, used to preach to a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public predictions were moderate, but, in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha City and left Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security officer for Reuters said under anonymity.
It subsequently entered the industry of paints and chemicals.
Rapper Rick Ross was denied copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", decided an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflelin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Federal Court of Miami, District Judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross's slogan, prominent part of his 2006 debut hit "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have repeatedly mentioned that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams's judgment weakens the prosecution for the infringement of copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, challenged him against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles electropop duet, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous 2010 song, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
The hip hop star said that the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the song Hustlin".
Kia Motors also sued for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" song in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling shirts and other products with the slogan shufflelin'.
In the judgment of Tuesday, Williams says that "Hustlin'", as a song, is protected by the law of copyright.
But Ross's three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have copyrights, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous music versions of the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO band was an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The process is scheduled for October.
Advocates Ross and LMFAO could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al. at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson is approaching Trump in the latest presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson approaches the bomb leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush fell in seven-point polls.
After the support of 27% of Trump in the most recent CBS/New York Times survey, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television star Mike Huckabee, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each with 6 percent.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, at single-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and leading the Bush family standards further, dropped seven percentage points in a month, while Wisconsin governor Scott Walker decreased by eight points.
In the last survey, support for Walker is 2%.
Carson has attracted greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% compared to 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of voters without a university degree (30% compared to 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the survey said they were determined to support in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who said I know who they're going to vote with twice as much Trump as Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for preliminary elections.
Results of the CBS/NYT survey carried out between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday before a presidential debate of the republics.
Carson's ascension to this survey reflects that of Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the presidential, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up to the presidential nomination of the CBS shows that Sanders rose by 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, New Hampshire, respectively, among Democratic voters for preliminary voting.
A leading ethical specialist claims that sexual robots should be prohibited
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sexual thieves seem to represent an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models of how they will show, what roles they will have, are very disturbing,” she said for the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and genre.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although the sexual robots that are now made are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that these are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we need to stop it from the face.
Surely, industry seems to be getting ahead.
A few years ago, the company producing Inflatable Dolls True Company launched Roxxxy, the "first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about possible dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among major industry representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk of something really dangerous in five years.
In an interview with BBC last December, theoretician and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that “the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race”.
UK welcomes the first Syrian refugees - RT UK
The following days, the Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, announced the Minister of Internal Affairs Theresa May.
They will receive assistance under the extended re-installation programme of the government.
Refugees looking for asylum arrive from camps on the border with the war-torn country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees that the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said the government "is working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and which they deserve be developed.
I know that honourable members and the general public want to know more about the number of persons and the date on which their arrival is estimated.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington, we will continue to keep the House informed on this matter.
But I am pleased to tell the Chamber that we are waiting to meet the first wave of refugees in the next few days and work quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron provoked the wrath of parliamentarians and militants when he unveiled the government refugee plan, many of whom believed that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the next general election.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal Democratic Parliamentarian Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "decessors".
Further, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Also important public figures and personalities have condemned the measures in turn.
In a joint letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla is recovering from global insecurity - RT Business
The Russian Ruble was strengthened on Wednesday by 65.66 compared to the US dollar and 73.98 compared to the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent of its lowest rate of 71 rubles for one dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble occurred due to the reaction of investors to current global market disturbances caused by China's weights, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
The Brent ratings increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 more cents, at $45.31 per barrel.
MORE CITIZENS: Most likely, interest rate will increase in the United States by the end of 2015 - US Fed
“It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by insecurity with regard to China and at the time of the increase in the rate of federal interest, which will continue to give the tone for oil and ruble prices,” said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began buying rubles.
Global markets await the decision on Thursday of the Federal Reserve, whether or not it will increase interest rate.
Markets believe that what could be the first increase in the US interest rate in nine years will not happen and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on drone traffic
NASA is already working with the US government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony to develop a database that allows drone pilots to book flight space blocks.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration comes as a result of a very widespread restlessness with regard to the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," says the research.
Without a common set of technology protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, the Baroness of the House of Lords, the concern grew on the background of the reports on events to the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
What is the solution: to build a system that monitors all drones, in particular those that fly to a height of less than 150 meters, whether they are driven by commercial pilots or amateurs.
“As more and more small drones carry out commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the level of visibility of the pilot, or fully autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, e.g. delivery of packages in cities,” she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the air space, methods of avoiding adverse weather conditions and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirection by methods similar to the rules established for road traffic, such as signalling and stripping.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is about to explode in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative EMS companies in the United Kingdom that use this technology with considerable effect in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
Over 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Discike button: Why does Facebook want to know what makes you sad?
"A Look Back" works like this, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about 240 billion USD after the last statistic - is due to the unimaginable amount of consumer data it holds.
Every interaction, postings, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered together and build a remarkable image of complex, in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is especially valuable for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people will see ads on Facebook, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and will certainly open a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who “appreciate” a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, “enquaint” with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see at News.
Facebook uses incredibly clever and sophisticated algorithms to narrow that huge content universe you could see in the smallest stream you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, on what you liked.
Undoubtedly, there is on Facebook fear that many interesting posts, but unhappy ones don't enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should be appreciated.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might make the decision to delete this kind of posts from News.
Facebook has carried out experiments in the past to understand how what you see at News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The representatives of the academic environment call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple attempt of Facebook (and published open with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and if they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The real understatement is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that operate hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another one that leads a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it makes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the ones best suited to stay on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and they'll soon have a button for this.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team established that body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent before they occur, thereby giving the attendants the opportunity to take the right steps.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is transmitting to us, and we need to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple color visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about a change in behavior, and the blue for lack of interest, giving the nurse an understanding that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The data in the bracelets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping the caregivers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Client Services at Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the 2015 Autech Conference on Autism and Technology from Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that they can make in their quality of life assistance technology. Now, apps for iPad give, in their own way, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the children learn to play hide-and-seek.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organisation for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the weeks to come"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air raids on the Isis targets in Syria, announced on Wednesday the government, just a few days after President François Hollande declared that the intervention was a "need".
France will carry out its first air raids on the Islamic State in Syria "on the following weeks," said defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday.
French air forces are carrying out recognition missions in Syria on September 8, and the attacks will follow "the following weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for the France Inter radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made “significant progress” in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
“In the Great Town there is an extremely powerful offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it,” he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition, which bombes Iraq's Isis positions for a year, but Hollande changed its strategy last week to expand its actions in Syria, under the conditions under political pressure it accumulates at the bottom of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on Syrian Isis militants.
Blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make your phone faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is launched on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising when using the version for the browser Safari from Apple.
On the test, it was found that after blocking ads, news sites such as New York Times are loading twice as fast, according to Reuters.
The blocking of ads also helps users to maintain the use of their data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising blocking tool, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits the ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People using advertising blocking software have a few constraints.
Ads are still displayed in applications (from here Apple wins money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, try to prevent their visitors from using such features to block ads.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development poses great challenges for the online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and supported financially for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertisements could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in revenue generated from advertisements only this year.
To activate blocking ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama met King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed various topics, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king addressed the subject of the struggle against the Islamic State and the ever-increasing crisis of immigrants in Europe - already facing hundreds of thousands of people who left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in the last few months.
Obama also emphasized the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which Spanish territory Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"As regards foreign policy, we have committed ourselves firmly to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
"We receive you with open arms," said Felipe.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a talk about tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States from the ascent to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.
Alfr Woodard joined the Luke Cage series
The famous actress Alfr Woodard has joined the distribution of the future Netflix Luke Cage series at Marvel. She will be an antagonist to Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero that gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and cousin of the recently announced Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the streets he has grown up," says a press release.
Her personal life and professional career are given to her by the newest hero of Harlem, Luke Cage, but also by her cousin's infamous actions, Cottonmouth.
“Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on screen, which makes it perfect for the role of community leader in Harlem,” said Jeph Loeb, executive producer and president Marvel Television.
We are delighted that such a famous and talented actress like Alfre has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will have the debut in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and will work as a showrunner and executive producer.

Luke Cage is one of four Marvel series in the Netflix franchise.
Soon, too, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will be broadcast, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the premieres of two of his most expected series: Screen Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second season of the Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is an applied trend for high profile series, as global social network traffic guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to enhance the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series about which there is much talk, such as Empire and Screen Queens," said Fox International channel president Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We're just waiting to broadcast these very interesting shows for fans around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season in the Empire, in which they will play famous celebrities like Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the premiere in September.
The new screen Queens series, where Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the next day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will participate in the World premiere of the film "Spectre"
Prince Harry and the Duke and Duke of Cambridge will participate next month in London in the World premiere of the latest film by James Bond, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, appointing the premiere for Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as RFP in 1946.
In the past, royal premieres have been selected and "Don't die today" (2002) and Royal Casino (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26, at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charitable one, which will benefit employees from British film and television industry.
Also at the premiere will participate actors from the film distribution, including lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.

"Spectre" will be broadcast in US cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen Monday having dinner together, sparking the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley cheering and smiling.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blouses, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken blouses, trousers and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who split up and with whom she constantly reconciles, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the message star for you at today's NBC show, saying it was "an angel who was sent to me and I'm very happy."
He added that “no one ends until it ends.”
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posted for Seventeen magazine, following her mother's footsteps.
Arctic mosquito Kings are big enough to take down a karib
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the growing climate, but global warming has proved beneficial for others.
One of these advantaged species is the arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at the Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the mosquitoes here to appear early and grow bigger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Centre for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of changes in temperature on arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in adult mosquito survival under a 2-degree increase in temperature.
The peasants are small, but they represent important members of the Arctic Trophy Chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists to anticipate better how a growing population of mosquitoes could affect the karibus they feed, the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pollen.
To build its demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth have combined their results in the field with the results of laboratory experiments that have researched how temperature influences the development of the insect and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes higher mosquitoes more vulnerable in front of collectors, it also gives them an early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can be developed but only to the extent that insect feed sources can support it.
The ability of mosquitoes to turn their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies have shown that the administration of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the development of their children's neurons or behavior.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin recovery inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is an increased risk for women and their children, which is why it should be treated.
"These studies add an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those of antidepressants administration.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of motors of children whose mothers treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian cohort study of mothers and children, investigating the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of motor skills at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had been using SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of these had been treated with prolonged medication.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers have written in the study that the association “was not as significant as giving the delay a clinical importance”.
A group of researchers from the Australian Adelaide University conducted a data review for 49 000 women from the Danish National Birth cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on child behavior up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of children whose mothers had been treated against SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared with 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to bleed after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal haemorrhage increased by 5% between 11 and 16% if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe haemorrhage or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that, although the study linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from the drugs taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers had about the specific medical conditions of women - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who took antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal haemorrhage, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Only on the basis of this study do we not recommend that women stop treatment against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of bleeding as much as possible.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of murder of the student from Virginia Technical University
The man accused of killing student Hannah Graham from Virginia University was charged with qualified murder in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University who disappeared in 2009, announced the authorities on Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33 years old, in Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Every head of charge receives the maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say that the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working hard and young for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm delighted to know that when you take someone's life, you have to suffer the consequences for your actions.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be seated.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for the latter and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's staying in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with qualified murder in the event of the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, together with friends at a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with the Pantera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica’s students wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found near a string of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lan, on a southwestern Charlottesville farm.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period overlapped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were related to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not immediately make public the details of the new evidence that led them to put Matthew under charge for Harrington's murder.
Defense lawyer Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the prosecution came two days after Hannah Graham's death in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they went out to the city in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18 years old, from Fairfax County, was seen going with Matthew to a mall in the center near U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first few days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the meetings and safeguards organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he has endured for her daughter speculations and media critics who must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"During all this time there have been talks like "Why wear short skirt?" and "I'm looking for it with candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it's clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trail of hunting," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who at the time of the attack was 26 years old, told the jury that, one evening in September, while she was walking home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a veritable area, beat her up, held her in the throat, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought my end came, that I had to scream endlessly," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, said the woman.
A D.A. told the jury that Matthew may have been scared of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive the sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he would most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today I've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the fate of the character or of the Games of Thrones series, Jon Snow, which was killed at the end of the fourth season.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knows how long the contract or HBO, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons he will appear, he said he could not talk about this subject.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is for sure.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the time when I'm buried in projects with long films," said the actor.
The show is back on the small screens in the spring of next year.
The Fans Games of Thrones launched a hysteria after the end of the fourth season, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched various theories, according to which he will somehow be brought back to life.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Medium" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a statement by the representative of Romania of the European Commission following this decision, about 120 million euros will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the following period.
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and to appreciate the efforts of the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the steps taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," reacted to the head of Hungarian diplomacy.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" at Hungary.
Referring to statements made by Harlem Desir, French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European immigration strategy", insisting that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World Cup
Romania's national rugby is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup that will start on Friday in Britain.
"Stejars" have proposed to obtain two winners in Group D.
"We want two winners, with the teams of Canada and Italy," Mihai Macovee, captain of Romania, said.

Refugee crisis: NO solution
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that Thursday will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann requested that a European Union summit be organised on Tuesday next week to resolve the refugee crisis.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure is intended to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redeploy refugees between Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organize an extraordinary EU summit.
Internal Ministers of the EU, meeting in Brussels on Monday evenings, failed to adopt the new proposal for an urgent redistribution of 120,000 refugees between EU Member States, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the refugee emergency relocation mechanism, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again provokes controversy after publishing cartoons that mock the response of predominantly European countries to the wave of immigrants from predominantly Muslim war-affected countries.
In the most recent issue of the publication, the publication drew attention again, as well as critics on social networks, writes the Reuters agency.
One of the drawings infects an overwhelming image of Aylan Kurdi, the boy Syrian dead, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after an unsuccessful attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in shorts and t-shirts, with the girl down on the sea shore, next to an advertising panel offering two children's menus at one's own price.
"So close to succeed," is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the Paris editorial office in January, is accompanied by the message "The proof that Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes on the water, while a smaller character wears shorts with his feet up in the water, the first saying "crestini go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after it was the target of an attack by Islamist militants in January, following repeated threats following the ridicule of the prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastically fined in Russia
The French Auchan supermarket chain was fined with over $370,000 by Russian officials, accused of food safety violations.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian agency for consumer protection Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total over 25 million rubles, i.e. $372,000, reports the Associated Press agency, quoted by the US News.
However, the reasons for these fines were not specified, and Auchan did not comment.
Also, the French chain of supermarkets is the target of the accusations of the Russian agricultural agency, which claims that some meat products have been detected as infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the issue of extending the sanctions of the European Union and France's decision to cancel an agreement on the supply of Mistral Russian vessels.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence at the border with our country.
MAE seems to have been brief in relation to this decision and that this is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE shows, in a release to the journal.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced publicly.
On the other hand, MAE has, in due course, informed the competent decision-makers in Romania in connection with this situation in a timely manner.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two EU Member States and that they are strategic partners is not politically correct, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, appears in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, said Tuesday Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax.
"The measure is necessary for traffickers of people who transit Serbia to change their routes, and there is a likelihood of heading towards Romania," explained the head of Hungarian diplomacy.
"The Gard would start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moved to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants transiting Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to go through the fence built by the Hungarian authorities on the east end of it, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can go around the fence through the area of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Government of Hungary has allocated 22.2 billion forers (71.8 million euros) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, a distance of 175 kilometers, and for special centres needed to hunt immigrants.
The fence initiative is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The unscrupulous body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite the desire to do so expressed by the widow of the politician.
According to a release from Ziare.com, the Senate's Permanent Bureau discussed, on Tuesday, a request by Doine Vadim Tudor, concerning the approval of the submission of the uninflated body of former Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter until the time of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the body was already deposited at a place of worship and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau appreciates that no longer needs to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate transmits.
Senator PNL Teodor Atansiu argued that this request "is not in agreement with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
It also transmits Agerpres, senators have held a moment of recalling former PRM leader, at the proposal of Senator UNPR Serbian Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died Monday night around 18:30.
The president of the PRM went to the Emergency Clinic of Cardiovascular Diseases of the Army.
The Europalamentar will be buried Thursday, from 12:00 to Ghencea Cemetery, and will have some military honours.
Are refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors of the border villages, ask questions about the accommodation places
The mayors of the border towns of Arad County are questioned by the Police and Border Police, these days, about the accommodation places for any refugees who could reach Romania, but also for the gendarmes, if they will be mobilized to the border.
The city building of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any strangers near the border.
We had talks with border officers, the national police and the local police, and with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant next time.
"I asked the farmers, who have work during this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the building said.
Immigrant crisis in Hungary: Armored and water cannons at the border
He, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police asked for information on the accommodation available in the case of a refugee wave.
We've been asked how many people we can hunt.
At us in the commune we have no space for refugees.
We believe that such special centres should not even appear at the border, because they are harder to control here, the migrants being tempted to escape, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to be set up such centres in areas beyond the border," said Mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said he was asked about both places for refugees and for the intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt and gendarmes.
We could find places at the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"I've been questioned about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "starting on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has established itself permanently."
"There's always a cop at the station, and locals know that they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," said the building.
The representatives of the Pulu Mayor said that they can house at least a hundred people at the Cultural Road, the information being offered to the police, upon their request.
Also, the mayor of the city Courtici, Nicolae Aanitei, said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of local public finances, but here are necessary arrangements.
A former border police barracks could also be designed to host refugees.
Representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not provide an opinion on the question of mayors during this period, only confirming that "in the border towns of Arad county, patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander announces radical measures against Becali Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical steps that will be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two parties negotiated a settlement, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical record of the "ro-albasters".
The team that won the Cup of Champions is on the break for now.
"It's not a historical break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," Boroi told Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process in which he claims damages from Becali's team will continue.
The period we refer to by ICCJ decision is very clear.
We have to recover the damage from FC Stara, the team that used the Stara brand without the acceptance of the estate - that is CSA Stara.
It appears very clearly and the continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Stara Bucharest football team, in one form or another, but in one legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfumers that it has until now in palmares," says George Boroi.
The star of Becali and the Army Club were in open war since the end of last year, when the supreme instant decided that the military are the ones holding the "Star".

The number two WTA has devalued that it has suffered from muscular tension, and at this point there is a special treatment.

The region that "collapses" millionaires
The millionaires in Asia-Pacific will form, this year, the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the wealth accumulated in China and India, a study published on Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Health Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the assets of the millionaires in North America, which currently represents the richest people in the world, with a accumulated fortune of $16,200 billion, transmits AFP.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, the face of 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least one million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.
"In the future, HNWI's wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets coming from emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand", is shown in the study by Capgemini and RBC Health Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for almost 10% of the overall wealth of HNWI and are responsible for 17% of the global increase in new assets after 2006.
China, the second economy of the world after the US, had in 2014 a number of 890,000 millionaires with an amount of $4,500 billion, increasing by 17.5% and 19.3%, compared to 2013.
In turn, India has the fastest rate of growth in the number of millionaires, 26.3%, up to 198,000 people, while their accumulated wealth has increased by 28.2%, up to 785 billion dollars.
"Dorel" mounted the reverse traffic light
At Suceava, the workers mounted a traffic light with the top down, so instead of being aware that they were waiting for 4 seconds, passersby receive the "h" message, which I don't know how to decrypt.
You don't have to, anyway everyone goes in red, informs the truth.
Each one passes by how he cuts his head off.
Two boys were to be taken upstairs by a car because they passed the red.
"Politics at the Ruteria should be here, helping, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the quoted source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Great Market in central Suceve, but passersby do not seem to want to take account of it, so much more than the information received seems to be pointless.
After 6 it comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was found responsible enough to give him the right to finish the work, then he wouldn't have gotten into this absurd situation.
Head of the Street Administration and Systemization Service Route of the Suceava Mayor recognized with cantonations as it was the face when the traffic light began to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We used them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"I was even in the front line when they were put to work," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be fixed as soon as possible.
Thank God it can be corrected, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Russia gas station, "Dorel" lost the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under Dunare, it is not known where, probably under the ground, buried, however it was not found, as even the economy minister Mihai Todose supported.
Police put guns in the water on immigrants.
On the main border of Hungary with Serbia Hungarian granite used, on Wednesday, water cannons and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed fence and introduced tough measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, at the Serbian-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water cannons were put into operation when immigrants managed to patrol through the salt fence through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
Hungarian police argue that the action of cannons was a crowd control measure, which throws water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were crying after the use of tear gas.
At the same time, the Hellenic publication Enikos writes that two German companies refused to deliver the sarcasm of Hungary.
Tara has already raised the fence at the border with Serbia and Tuesday announced her intention to raise one and the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised in Bucharest.
German companies support that chirpeda sarma is very dangerous and causes cuttings that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisons or military installations, but should not be used against people looking for shelter, supporting companies.
In parallel with the border borders of Hungary, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to immigrants by bus to transport the border country to Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, including 73 children, further showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, about Greece's drama - why agree to the third EU agreement
The declared purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with EU leadership in Brussels.
In the end, the leader Syriza made part of a third loan agreement for this country, which also involves several years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which conducts an interview with him.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to re-entrust the prime minister's mandate, in elections on which he claims his political position will be raised.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismemberment of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," former prime minister Elen said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Hellenic government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says Greece "evidently needs reforms," stating that it must begin with the state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 stormy months in the lead of the Executive of Athens, the period when a third loaned rescuer for Greece was approved.
It was chosen with broken neck and one-degree burns after it exploded in front of the electronic cigarette
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered burns of one degree, fracture to his neck and a finger and a hole like a coin in the mouth sky, after an electronic cigarette that he smoked exploded in front of him.

Star Trek actress, in jail for naked in front of children
Actress Jennifer Lien, known in Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, instructing Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she was on September 3rd - the bail being set at $2,500 - took place in front of her Tennessee house.
Vedeta started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of her children crying, informs Mirror.
At one point, during the fight, the actress raised her shirt, showing her bust, because then, before entering the house, she took off her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was taken with force to the car.
It's not the first time she's been acting at the age of 41 having problems with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then making herself guilty even of the attack.
Jennifer entered Kes's skin in 1995, after which she appeared in the American History X, a film in which Edward Norton also played.
She gave up acting in 2002, when her first child was born.
She's married to the writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
They're being seen with the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West as supporting terrorism and as "and watching" immigrants.
"The West cries for them and the West supports terrorism from the beginning of the crisis, when he said it was a peaceful revolt," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The Damascus leader claims that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hugged them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, stop supporting terrorism.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," added Syrian leader.
Assad continued his accusations to the Western States and with regard to the treatment they show to refugees.
It is as if the West now cries for refugees with one eye and takes them in sight with the second-eyed machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and crimes and second-hand because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of the infrastructure, you won't have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," says Bashar of Assad.
"If we were asking any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and family'," said the Syrian president, adding as political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "we should unite around what the Syrian people want."
Sirie's president is of the opinion that his country's dialogue should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is how we, like Syrians, can achieve the political objectives that we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from the friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar of Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West again for falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the coup in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a giant.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses Russia's opposition and has come to power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that he was chosen in democratic elections, and the West himself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, they're no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader from Damascus pointed out.
Not lastly, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
On the other hand, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, about which he said that "I can't even make a move without coordinating with the United States and other Western countries."
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition" led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with and against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, you'll get caught - then we have no object in cooperating with all these countries, considering that it's a real and not false coalition that fights terrorism," said the leader of Damascus.
Autumn?
Not at all.

The sky will be clear and in the east, where meteorologists announce 27 degrees to Botosani, 25 to Suceava, 23 to Piatra Neamt, 26 to Iasi, Vaslui and Bacau, 25 to Focsani and 26 to Galati.
In the rest of the country is announced 30 degrees at Targu Mures, 28 at Sibiu, 26 at Ramnicu Valcea, 25 at Pitesti, Targoviste and Ploiesti, 26 at Braila, 25 at Tulcea, 26 at Slobozia, 27 at Calarasi and Jurgiu, 26 at Slatina and 28 at Turnu Severin.
Map of countries with the highest prices and how Romania stands
The collapse of the oil quota has caused major losses in the last year of workers in the extraction of the title, the shareholders of energy companies and countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in the period from October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all the 76 countries taken into account, the fuel price has fallen.
The most important price reduction at the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine cost 97% so you can feed 24 SUVs less than one dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, changes in taxation, as well as fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg has turned the average price of each state into US dollars.
Situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approximately 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
So we're ranked 27 in the country with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, gas was cheap to the Romans as well.
At that time, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a discount of 10.6%.
However, the countries around are better off.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92 and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans are setting up the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to the 16 countries of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country across southern Europe.
After a nearly four-hour meeting with prime ministers from the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals, as well as distribution centers.
"They're needed such pivot points," she pointed out.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, Merkel added.
Land Primers asked for more help than the €6 billion agreed by the federal ruling coalition more than a week ago.
Prime Minister of Thuringia Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party requested a "little double, and for commitments, be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the trial in 48 hours and Holland in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Land Prime Minister Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria bears the hardest burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Christian Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, went into public conflict with Merkel after the chancellor announced a virtual open door policy at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the match with Real Madrid, which Sahthior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahthior lost because she was disfavored.
Before the game I said one thing, that I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in major teams in Europe, we are always underprivileged by arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
We're getting a yellow card right away, while the top teams don't.
In addition, the first penalty was in no way!
The ball hit Darijo in the back, without touching his hand.
A game such a level should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regreet that arbitration broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so bad here"?
They were pieces of the cut husband.
A common sadism murder terrified the inhabitants of Targu Beautiful and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the market in Târgu Nicemos could see terrifying scenes near the main entry into the market.
Along with the three graves, the criminals "assembled" in pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
It was cut, but his head, internal organs and genitals were missing.
In the end, it would prove to be the body of an former officer, who had been cut off by his wife, professor of geography.
"Iasi's day" has been talking to the swallows even with the cab driver who helped the killer, without knowing it, to the carriage of bags with the dead body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman with three bags that had terrible spirits, after pieces of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from the Nice Fair.
As in American films, the man himself helped transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, without knowing it, being the killer's client for a race.
The taxi meter told, exclusively for "Iași Day", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
It carried with its hands the bags in which were pieces of body of the husband's geography teacher, which he had cut.
She had come to the Beautiful Fair to hide the evidence of the murder as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe he's got mine.
I didn't have how you knew.
Nea Mihai, as it is known to his friends who practice taximetry in the Nice Fair, has become star over the night in the small town in which he lives.
He's seen American films throughout his life, but he never thought he'd ever get to be himself the one who's going to stand at the back of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It tells that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, it usually expects the arrival of buses that regularly transit the town.
It was close to the intersection of roads to Roman and to Pascans.
The cab driver tells that the killer woman observed in the rear-view mirror next to the sacks with body pieces supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters away from passing pedestrians from Pascani, right on the border where it displays the mileage.
The bags were riveted by the signboard with the indicator.
After he left the bus, I gave in the Marcher ten meters, up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, but what smells so bad here?"
I saw that she was an elderly woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the disposal, maybe he's got mii, I had no way to know.
I thought maybe he might want to squeal someone with that stinking meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I hesitated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied up.
"He specified me to take her to the large market gate, when I took her from the bus," he began telling Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman did not say anything at all, and therefore he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until my destination, I didn't talk about anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in the car.
And when he pulled the bags out of the car, I noticed that it smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back into the car, I gave two meters back to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and I moved the car over and over here, to disappear the smell.
At the bus I didn't notice if someone was helped to get the bags down, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see well in the mirrors.
"There were two bags of plastic and one of rabies," the man added.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's starting to touch her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something's not right.
After he took his bags off, I went to the hospital, to the city hall, and when I returned, I looked especially at seeing what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She had been hauling the luggage behind the fence, where are the dumplings inside the market.
Then I left again.
There was little agitation because a microbus from Italy and a bus arrived.
I saw the woman go to their drivers to get in, disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very agitated, she was walking over and over here.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen her some time ago.
I looked them up and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Mihai added.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after she left her luggage in the dumpsters.
At me, the suspicion left from the fact that the luggage had disappeared, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and pointed to me, telling her that I had noticed that she had a suspect luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," ended his taxi driver's account.
The Neamt prosecutors, who investigate the case, say that 64-year-old teacher Ana Zaharia was surprised by the vision cameras of a Roman gas station at 0.55 hours, going up with the three bags by bus.
She arrived at the Nice Fair at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then broke him into the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday evening, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she transported to the bus, and hid them.
Last night, he transported one more, then decided in which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iași.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But his head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a shed in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychically trained, and the body will be examined by the forensics, to officially determine the cause of death and possible other relevant details.
The municipality took over national roads from the city's base, after years ago they had been taken over by the Government, to be able to be asphalt with money from the national budget, in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and a decision by the Government is needed to be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a constipation for the establishment to grant the opinion for the General Banish Ur Plan (PUG).
The city has taken over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that transit the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not complied with, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, government decision will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
National roads that close the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The National Road 28 hits the Iașul on the arteries: road Păcurari, road Munteni (to be mafor), road Moara de Fire, road Silvestro, street Silvesstru, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Spring, road Chisină, road Túțora until the exit from the municipality to Tomesti - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium road, Bd. Socola (until traffic lights), Bucium road (up to base 3), Chesinau Road, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, Bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Further describing files from Mircea Eliade's "folder" of the political sympathies of youth, which, however condensed, would have exceeded the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most veheant charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less humorous description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "anti-legislationary", would be appropriate to spark it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analyzing the various versions of Eliade's Regiment in the Legion through the "Axa" Cube and Radu Gyr's, Florin Turcanu brings into discussion, in the volume of Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree in the understanding of the resumption of epistoll contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceausescu "the balcony scene" in August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the safety investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as a follow-up note from 1938, Florin Turcanu says that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in so-called "Legal Family" called Light, a group of "cuiburi" by intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr."
As regards the Light nest, there is no verifiable data, those in exile who consider the existence of this "legislationary family" to be questionable, what must be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving aside the surprising kindness of the SRI to make these secret files available to Mr.Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the goal of the pursuit of Security was "commander" Radu Gyr, the mention of Eliade by making himself, as noted in March 21, 1938, in the context in which Armand Călinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs received free hand to take all necessary measures so that King Carol could enforce his Royal Dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legions that began to enjoy unexpected popularity (the All Party for the Third Country in the 1937 elections).
The arrest of Eliade was carried out following this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the 1938 repression and it is likely that such superficial notes were made in represial for the vast majority of legionists or active sympathizers in public space who were to be arrested, but which were to be linked by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holographic statement mentioned above, given in arrest, in February 1941, after the collapse of the legionization rebellion, only confirms retrospectively on the first, the trivial method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had provided more details on the contents of the above-mentioned 573 file.
Was it Eliade or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it must anyway be a file built on the safety documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against each other or against each other.
It is here a misunderstanding, as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a preliminary stage, of proof, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, during the trial period of three years before becoming "camerad" with acts in order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as the intellectual clubs or scenes, the siters, the groups of conversations with the peasants, the organizations of the young or the gravitative students around a nest, were his "family", were not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuance completely escapes the unanticipated reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which can be plausible) understood and used ad literally to designate political regulation in the nest.
Of course, invoking such interpretation subtleties cannot conceal the public support of the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade during 1935-1940, whether in the siege of Nae Ionescu or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean and political regulation itself said all the more so as, normally, intellectuals of this size retain a type of superiority in the face of activists as such and does not go into politics unless they are directly given high privileges.
As much as I could form an opinion about Eliade's kind of thinking at that time, when he was the "leader of the young generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted hierarchical rigor from a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
To no longer mention, except in the past, the fact that, in any legionary "folder", what they receive is anti-semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Eliade, until new evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Hangoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, is trying to sanction Florin Turcanu's claims (based on some archive documents, even if it was deserved to be dissected and contextualized more seriously) with a questionable argument.
Mircea Hangoca notes, in the volume Nou glosse on Mircea Eliade (București, 2006), that "not one line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any allusion to this setting".
He had no way in 1968, when, somehow alive from the communist occles, Radu Gyr could not have risked an allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think he wanted to stress is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah's descent.
There really isn't even the most pale suggestion that Radu Gyr would have been Eliade's boss.
Intelligent, the poet obliged to write to the Glass of the Land, devotes himself from the head of the place the embarrassing condition signaling to Eliade (who knew exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly occupied with the denigration of the exile of the right), to the signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visible easy and happy when it responds affectionately to him after almost three decades of separation since the "viclean time" had alienated them.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he was given (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back at least calm to see his mother and friends) and that he, skilledly performs it dry and by short sentences, separated by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, refined political complicities suggested or any evoking of the years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It's hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legionary line, but until strengthening this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in this correspondents memories that confess a mutual appreciation of some characters who have distinguished, but statorically, our culture and who, beyond the terrible trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbelic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not, instructive for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the fate "under the weather" of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally gave up refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, on the pretext offered by the health problems and catastrophic floods in the country, announces the RSR authorities through the embassy (with which he carried a sporadic correspondence used to obtain his sister's passport), that he cannot give course to the invitation to return to the country.
The follow-up was predictable: it is again indexed, mounted in Israel "the Tolladot business", the books sent to family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped from censorship, never see their mother again.
Among friends in the country only with Noica still has a sporadic correspondence although surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of private people or Romanian institutions are more able to send them messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr never got permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaussescu regime tried Eliade's second conviction operation (through official invitations, Noica's actions, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed forever.
New coach, foreign players
Due to the shortage of indigenous volleyballists, Penicillin Iasi tests in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exits take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of Division A1 of the female volleyball, Penicillina Iași kept its place in the first step due to the withdrawal and then the demise of the Miroslava Science band, newly promoted in the first escalation following a barrage tournament even in the outgoing municipality.
The news took little time to run the exit group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, he went to the Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studineu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdila (the White Blaj Voli champion) and the Maria and Iuliana Fica sisters.
Of course, until the start of the 10 October championship, there was also time for the lot to complete.
First there was found a new coach in the person of Dan Gavril, from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has worked little in recent years at Penicillina, it wet to sign a contract with the group led by the left Vasile.
Then two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconița were brought, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to being the holiday player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrinca Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the team of the Peniciline led by Dan Gavril made a canton at the Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with Banat's Cup, where the exits won a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but they also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, between September 23-25, Penicillina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but Romania's player fund is quite low and that is why we will also call on volleyballists from abroad, especially after the decision that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from Romanian clubs.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competitive year in 5-6 places, even if it will be very hard," said Vasile Left, President ACS Penicillina Iași.
Thrilling meeting.
Males gathered after almost 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany after their mother of Polish origin had just been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for her, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
For decades George and Lucian didn't know one about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents demonstrating that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they didn't find any evidence to lead them to Lucian.
Only in 2015, thanks to the program, Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal were won by the children of the former German Open Championship from Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organised by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
Five teams from Iași were trained at the Dance Energy Club and danced with 9,000 sportsmen from 20 countries.
The 10 children participated in five different categories (youths 1, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy leading places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujba and not last pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionița.
As a coach I wanted to reaffirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reconfirmation is necessary for us as teachers, as well as for sportsmen, as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we have managed to hear the Romanian hymn twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to an even higher level.
"All this would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," Andreea Ramona Manolache, the kids' coach at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country for 4 out of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iași.
6 methods to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run for a mountain weekend to escape stress.
Some keep our time, others their finances, and others both obstacles.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little bit of stress.
These involve neither high costs nor special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Daily care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we make them face and what attitude we take of them.
Instead of grinding inside and feeling how an implosion takes place in your mind, try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep breath
Breathing exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any man in part, and breathing at a tense time helps release endorphins into the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child
We know that we've passed the age of childhood and we're no longer allowed to cheer up when we feel like it.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office headquarters or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and we can't just type our props.
You can get rid of the nerves and negative energy accumulated over a day with a few shrieks.
Imagine a nice place.
We know that the recommendation sounds worthy of a replication during a psychotherapy session, but not for the sake of psychologists often use it.
Imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detachment of daily braking, can lead to attenuating the mood of nerves.
It's really self-suggestion, a process that can even change lives, both for good and for bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
It's best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Place your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might find yourself struggling to relax.
Listen to even relaxing songs, which are lined up and do not contain lyrics, to regain balance as soon as you turn on your fist.
Decoy or orange
Does that sound strange advice to decoy an orange to the nerve?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not about the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasional, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell during peeling stimulates his brain to produce endorphins, the hormone of well-being.
Feeding an animal
Those who have animals close by, whether it's the one at home, or it's the one who went to work, take a few seconds to handle it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal mangaitation may lower blood pressure.
Hora and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with instruments somewhat rival, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces from the Romanian folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and from that moment we were very pleased to sing together, having a virtually unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the moment there was a violin with a guitar.
Christi: "From the first meeting we realized that we heard very well what we were singing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us learned from the other's repertoire and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there is a gap between classical music people and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who only listen to rock to get to like them and classical music.
And I was surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to that and they'd love it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems to us great."
Students in Iasi spent more time in traffic than in school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday morning in hell traffic in several areas.
The municipality announced that since today the Mangeron Boulevard (slai Bahului mal left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș, has been closed.
The mayor's chiefs failed to comply with their promises to carry out work for the smoothing of traffic at the start of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has given, at least twice in the last few weeks, has been re-established in the area of the International Warehouse.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be mounted, and the last term of work was the end of last week, the rotation was not carried out yesterday.
The nerves of the drivers were maximum spread to Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, considering that another promise of the City was violated: the move of the customs activity of Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "as late as late as the end of August", in the context in which this transfer is discussed since 2012.
Currently, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica says that the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we must take account of the traffic traffic in the area, an opinion must also be given from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay in rotation, but we'll sort it out," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, he said, would be stopping the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of the Red Bridge.
The queue of cars on St. Lazarus' street stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I've been waiting for good minutes to get out in the Red Pod," said one exiter.
By Podu Roș they had to travel to CUG in September, if the rehabilitation project "Development and rehabilitation of the South functional artery" was completed within the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"We raised European funds for new works, for example, overextending, on the initial version of the Nicolina passage was narrow," Chirica said.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of the traffic is October.
During yesterday's day, the Jesuits reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Pâcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armaine Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
Adornence could return as head to the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judicial Council will be kept under judicial control and prohibitions.
The Judges of the Iași Tribunal resolved a new deadline yesterday in the "Album" file, in which the accused is also the suspended president of the Iași County Council.
At the end of yesterday's meeting, the magistrates decided to take a decision during tomorrow's day on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Adomnita.
The latter wishes to live or revoke this measure, which has been kept away from the head seat of the JC for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained by the higher court, Cristian Adomnita will be able to resume its role as President of the JC.
The Adonnita was sued by the National Directorate for Anti-Ruption (DNA), being accused of favoring the perpetrator and false intellectuals after, say pro-curori, it would have tried to mask an audit control following which there had been a series of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and the Laser Co firm.
The ADM would have tried to hide that the institution it led would not have received more materials for the promotion of Iași county, although these materials were scripturally presented as received by the CJ.
Along with him, justice and three directors of the CJ, but also the managing director of the Laser Co firm, have been referred to.
Another 3,500 people are expected to vote until September 25th
The municipality is prepared to distribute further questions if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The Jesuits have only ten days left to express their opinion about replanting the teas on the pedestrian Stephen the Great.
According to the municipal officials, approximately 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the district centres and at three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexander the Good and Town Hall).
A record number of exits appeared on Sunday in front of the City Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "The Island loves tea", 530 exits voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes cast each minute.
On the other hand, throughout the course of the month, there were about 440 exits in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many exits proclaim the signaling and the population of the inefficient public consultation.
They therefore called on internet users yesterday to print an information poster made available by the group and to paste it into the block.
The volunteers also showed that at the additional point in the Copou park the last forms were completed by exits on Sunday.
We'll offer forms from the neighborhood centers, where it's not much completed.
"Possible additions will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed," said the municipality's spokesperson Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scruits the null of the canvas" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of replanting the trees then the City will plant your silver in this fall.
The Jesuits can express their opinion at the neighborhood centres in Dacia, Niceasa, Tătarași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the points mentioned above.
The mayor's chiefs decided to cut the teas from Stephen the Great at the beginning of 2013, which brought a fine of 60,000 lei of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "The Island loves teas", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for replanting tea was signed by over 9,100 supporters until last night.
RECORD of registered students at USAMV Iasi!
It's 920 in year I.
The University has 920 students this year.
The representatives of the University of Science Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" indicated that this year most candidates have ever been admitted, from the history of the institution of higher education, since the establishment.
We are very pleased with the results this year since admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in university history, almost 920 students in year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We've also had senior candidates, we've taken the seats from the budget to the license and master," said Professor John Ténu, director responsible for didactic work.
He further stated that the university has also registered a considerable number of students at tax, occupying 20% of these places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results have also been published on the study lines in Romanian, admission to the English study programme at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has released 50 places, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and is now expected to be answered by the ministry on the confirmation of student records and the necessary study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were placed on the 14 budgeted posts and 209 were released to the "taxed" competition in the licence studies.
Most cases were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, number 75, at Horticulture were 23, and at Zoothehnie, 22.
At the master's session, 18 files were filed at the fall session, on the 150 tax seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zoothehnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of the cars in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge
The bridge over Bahului on Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard was as strange as when "Iași Day" wrote about the problems it presented 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then pointed out that the axis that demarcates the two senses of walking the asphalt was left, defending the deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, through which the concrete plates that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to crack on one side and on the other side of the axis, presing signs that deep ones will increase.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, in order to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tramway, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica states that the area affected by cracks and pits will be marked and asphalt works will be carried out quickly.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the assembly of poplars and signaling strips, without making even a simple lead.
During this period, we focused more on opening the school and the work needed for this purpose.
"There is a point-of-the-art expertise on the bridge that we are waiting for in about a week with the details needed for the intervention, I appreciate that in at least two weeks we can move on to remedy the situation," said the interim mayor.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if to enjoy myself or let me be afraid of melancholy; inclined, passive, towards the second variant.
First, because I feel like it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotion, to the garden.
Although it is light, no normal parent is happy to raise their children.
Second, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, at the top, had not ended until today.
I wasn't even what is usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But the school always liked me.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend it, even as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't a simple job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like every one of us, I've given all sorts of teachers: better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or just imbecile.
Unfortunately, there are also people with other calls in this breeze.
I think they're toxic, because they're damaging the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man who's willing to form.
I had the chance to give, while I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptional teachers.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the right time.
Anyone who believes that the role of the chair is the trivial transmission of information is wrong.
This can be done by anyone; by information, you can inform the student very well on your own, that we only live in the era of transparency.
A good teacher, however, molds the minds of the people.
It shapes them, crushes their thinking.
To sit in the chair is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very picky, demanding, unforgivable and always willing to look for the herbs in their face.
So dictates their age, their temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought that we knew everything, that we had certain facts about anything.
When we grow up, we come to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the teenager out of his own self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, start doubting, asking questions.
To discover on its own the answers, either them or the provisionals.
Get involved in everything he does.
Put him in a discreet direction to the profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student believes that the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just waiting to catch the wrong foot to sanction it.
Now, that's what directs him, the pure, uncomprehensible, rebellious, due to his full age calls, to look at the chair with suspicion.
That he just can't accept his natural attempt to order him.
Teenagers are not allowed to set up, they do not accept restrictions.
Or, if I feel like I'm doing it, they're taking revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when there is a rigid person in the chair, who insists on hard and doesn't communicate, the students get revenge on the object handed over.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, due to the lack of touch of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who feel that history is a data mix, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their unconscious mind.
I always urge students: if you give up a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him push you away from literature to which you should go.
How did it happen that I became the teacher myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puberty ever since on his understanding.
I've met, in high school, a university professor who opened the door to his library.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had walls of the house covered with shelves stuffed with books.
I lost myself in his library and dreamed I had one too.
Now maybe I have it, but if I hadn't gotten my fate in the way, maybe I would have decided to become a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are random.
I don't believe in chance.
Essentially, it is to give over to the man who takes your hand and leads you patiently toward his own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me to talk only about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be handed over.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's math teacher.
How do you fix the ineffable concepts?
You can approach him, at most, without claiming that you are transmitting petrified truths.
The chair can at most guide the reading, that's everything else.
But especially, it can lead to some miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, which can lift, talk to someone, the blindfolds.
Therefore, the professor of literature must, first of all, be able to get his students to understand (feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great sewer, Al. Paleologu, says one thing just apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not the other way around!" and he was right.
That's why a good teacher prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Luckily, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, only a great truth is repeated with inertia: not only did the students have to learn from their masters, but the opposite.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few find him, it's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a purely blood teacher than to endure as many such separations.

If you extend FIFA
Justice from the United States and Switzerland will go to new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new individuals and organisations, under the FIFA corruption investigation, they inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, on Monday, at a press conference in Zürich, that the area of global football corruption investigations has been expanded.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage in additional criminal prosecutions to new individuals and organizations," Lynch said.
In May, more FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We hope that other people being prosecuted will get to the United States," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said his institution had confiscated several goods, including houses and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the United States.
"I didn't get to the end of the first rehab," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terrabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
The investigators also entered into a media rights concession contract at the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal, after American justice has accused 14 people, including two FIFA vice-presidents and seven officers of the forum.
Persons detained are researched for mitigating and receiving other benefits, from the early 1990s and until now, amounting to over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced in early July that he resigned from FIFA's office as president after being re-elected for the fifth time.
Beats like movies at the theater
In the Supekombat gala from Milan, the exit Catalin Moroșanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Catalin Moroșanu, will participate, on October 2, in the Superkombat gala at Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a release release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as we promised, we will return this fall with a new five star gala.
If I still chose an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight like in the movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters on the event schedule.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, among which the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full program," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination gala with the American James Wilson, known after 2012 participated in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous awards from the bodybuilding contests.
I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still mad that last year I couldn't fight in the end, so now I'm going to get revenge on him.
"From beast to cat," said Moroșanu.
Unbeated in 2015, Andrei and Bogdan Stoica's brothers will have in Italy the last encounters before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, they both went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm glad I'm going back to Italy, last year's atmosphere has been incredible.
"I'm just waiting to meet the fans there and promise them a new unforgettable show," said Andrei Stoica's world champion.
In Milan he will fight also Raul Catinaș with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England on her birthday, but she also argued in her letter.
A girl from Great Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace, when she went to visit him along with her family.
The letter was not left without echo, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for her invitation, but also apologized that she could not be present on September 27, but even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died from the heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both of them were writers and politicians, and both of them died out at close, heart-to-heart ages.
Adrian Peunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died on a TV reality show.
Vadim Tudor ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the Minister of Tourism of that time, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, smiling on jokes, to Adrian Păunescu, "I'm jealous of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
Păunescu, smiling too, then he said, "It's not too laudative what you told me now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two Unconscious People After an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident took place on Monday evening around 19:00 in the town of Dumbrava in Iași County.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen car.
The biker was not noticed by the driver.
Luckily, they're both stable.
Following the impact, the windshield and the mirror of the car were broken.
Two injured people are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD crew is on its way to provide medical assistance to victims and transport them to the hospital.
The cops are on the spot.
A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his countrymen, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Puppets, the modified video game has centred on "Mario Refugee".
The character is trying to get past trafficking in persons and border police, on its way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses Samir al-Mufti's pseudonym for security reasons and said that he played the video game with refugee Mario after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe, to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova detention center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I, and the highest is 25 years old and is in Class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Prisons Administration to try to draw attention, and thus, to less known realities.
The youngest, 15-year-old, is enrolled in Class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated topics that society is concerned about discussing at this time, we are all driven by its own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people from Craiova detention center offer," said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday at the school year's opening feast.
The Minister of Justice has drawn attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedies, stating that the young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could follow the course of the natural school of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to respect the law and what consequences can have its disregard.
"The role of the penitentiary system is not to permanently isolate people from societies who have violated the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to re-educe them and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they have more chance of reintegration," said Cazanciu.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, detention conditions are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, each year, in the prison system, there are over 2,000 graduates of the school courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change over the night that hasn't been done for 25 years, but there are important steps we're taking.
"In all these steps we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," said Cazanciuc.
The Minister of Justice praised the success of both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the joint effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would launch all the students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Major and not only, to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be disbanded!
prestigious university petition in Iași and the country
More than 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society requesting the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even eliminate the doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic taxation".
The signing of the petition launched on 10 September also included educational frameworks and teachers in Iași.
Among the university Signatory of the petition in the outward academic environment is, for example, Prof.Dr. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to culture people who are also university didactic frameworks, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Act provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, resulting in the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate ethical rules in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the petition states.
That petition specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, evaluation of medical schools, suspension of the right of operation for any medical school in which more than two plagiarisms were found until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any medical school where there is no minimum number of doctoral drivers provided for by law to meet the criteria required by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility to grants of IDEA projects.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why does there not exist in Europe other academies that give doctorate organized by secret services, and top soldiers who give it to their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academy Society, who initiated the petition, which also originated from Iasi.
This can be completed by all interested parties on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organisation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "For Iași" party, founded by young non-political IT managers, was launched the other day in Copou Park.
The president of the "For Iași" Initiative Group gave an interview to "Iaşi Day"
The Iash will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of politically unaffiliated entrepreneurs and managers so far launched at the end of last week the Party for Iași organisation that will propose candidates to the local elections in 2016.
At present, the core of the party is made up of IT specialists, but training leaders say that all people who want to get involved in modernizing the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday, in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 sympathizers participated, almost all being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Save Bucharest Association.
He was the surprise of the local elections in 2012, when, from the independent position, he was able to gather 10% of the votes of the joys for the mayor of the capital.
"The people I saw at "For Iaşi" think they're very good at accessing the public administration of Iaşi."
I believe in this initiative, I think he has a chance, I think he may have more chances in a community than in Bucharest.
"I'll be with Iaşi all the time," said Nicusor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: Reasons are more sentimental and emotional.
I've been away in many short business trips, I've also lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt like this is my house.
ZDI: Why have you decided now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have begun to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started talking about how we could get involved.
At first, we became more shy, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and somehow things have evolved naturally and organically, and now it's time that we came to the decision that we have to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make the activity of local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of minimal computerization of the city's activities so that different departments, institutions and kings cooperate as well.
But more importantly, we can publish transparent data on activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to consult the affected people publicly.
If we talk about efficiency, we must not forget the transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be purchased.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How would you promote the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: You get on the plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from the business and we bring customers to Iași.
ZDI: What's the brand of the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotics area, the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I'm referring here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iașu already has a historical brand that must not change, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communication, working with people and running projects.
We have management experience.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "voluntaries" on the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people like that.
ZDI: Should Iaş mayor be more concerned about promoting the city's image nationally and internationally, or is it necessary that the area of concern be permanent in its edilitaric nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without another doesn't work.
First, you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Now, if you don't make the city known, if you don't attract money in the city, at some point you'll be without money and you won't be able to do, for example, streets.
Both must be done at the same time and must be competent men next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor-father, who comes and beats with his fist in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something right, have a bad reputation, be clear integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, the Introspecials company was set up after, for seven years, he was director of Endava International Affairs (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that set up with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC Irum SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the program to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor and agricultural machinery park, initiated in 2011, also called Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
Linked to the Rabla Programme, there have been some trials in recent years, but it proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program it was able to sell somewhere to 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to him, Irum Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a great competition with those coming from outside, all the world's producers have set their eyes on Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"At all fairs there is a large agglomeration, all producers exhibit, come with all sorts of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who said that Irum Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors annually.
By the program Rabla for tractors, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as the combos, could teach them and instead received a valuable ticket of 17,000 lei.
The red flag has been lifted
The internal election of workers seems to be more spectacular and political, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his head of launch in future elections.
Raise, therefore, the red-burning flag. Under his skirts we will live and die.
That's what he sang yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn in the London Sanctuary House pub.
He's been testifying to many facts and oaths/Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the musical line of this unofficial British and international left (The Red Flag) ambiguity can search the Internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we fall.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not those that float them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left yesterday with the one tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it's going to happen that way, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of a leader chosen the other day.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed an impressive democratic exercise.
Not British workers invented the voting system directly for the party leader, on the west side.
French Socialists have been practicing for a few years a more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate in 2012.
However, the internal election of workers seems to be more spectacular and more politically significant, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his leading in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, personalizing power being more pronounced in the UK than on the other side of the Channel of Manicure.
In addition, participation in the vote was great in all three "searches": members themselves, members of trade unions and other party-affiliated organisations and finally the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group provides us with interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially those made up of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to involve themselves even more, in the future, just because of Corbyn's signal of victory.
There are, as I know, sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "external circle" worker, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we have quite a lot of attitudes similar to those of sympathizers Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), noting that they will travel through the traditional channels of the left.
If we have to identify a "antisystem" vocation, it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a disguised form of the multi-thulite thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive election failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go far enough to the left, that they were not firmly bound by the Tony Blair era.
The second repertoire - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we abstract from the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations for other political themes, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments favourable to the social state and animated by the aspiration of equity, disarmament supporters and hostile to military involvement over the determination, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish workers thus lost an electorate to which they should have, at least in principle, privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Such energy exists everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chance of success than Ed Miliband, the laborer's "aristocrat".
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than with the left antisym from the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we will learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as leader of the opposition.
We'll see if the Red Flag will come back in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader will have occupied his place, first of all the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unit - and in this regard he even has reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without good science
While I wrote the article, I went through my head to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marine to his person "Laith Al-Saleh Jihadist" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me from the circumspect start).
I didn't.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel two photos - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and the one, in fact: the two depicting Sirian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Coming With the Wave of Refugees" (signified by Viorica Marin in the Truth of September 3).
Monday evening, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among others, a sleeve shot from the friend (not just the FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, except a precision. Saleh's Laith is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and that.
"So you could add and manipulate the gross in the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt sick.
All the more so as as as I wrote the article went through my head to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marine to his person "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me circumspect start).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
Instead, I had no other comment on Marius Cristian's handling of the sleeve than that: "That's what I need if I trust the Truth."
After that, I obviously took the story to small money and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest one we found in a material by the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader Seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island Kos of Greece, where they noticed, among hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to make orders in the chaos of many.
The man was Syrian stunner Laith Al Saleh from Aleppo who "is used to be in command", since "he led a 700 rebel unit in the Syrian civil war".
We also find that Al Saleh, aged 30, had "a home, a wife and a normal life before he started the fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put on the roads a third of the people of Syria".
In the interview with the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells us that "everybody wants to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist Islamic state group) wants me, the government wants me to fight everyone.
Besides being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Now two days ago, I saw a sniper in government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From material we also know that Laith (which means lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to Holland, where he has a cousin - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he also became rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and then to bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an age with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
A madman - who wants freedom must fight against not just one enemy but three!
I've been over a Serbian material since 22 August, of which I have not understood much, only that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come together with migrants: TERRISTS SE KRIJU ME put on the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which they are attached a photo with Al Saleh with beard holding a Syrian flag in their hand and the refugee flag in which they wear the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On September 7, then, himself on the BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claim to show an IS figter pose as a refuge - This viral picture claims to be wrong to depicting a fighter of the Islamic State putting into refugee.
We find out that the picture (in fact: photos - with Laith with beard and gun and the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who user would and would apologize in the meantime.
Only before that, only from his wall, the image with both pictures would have been shabbed more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse was gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu from Hotnews took up the story with the manipulation of the BBC, but translated the title: "A fake photo became viral looks like an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee."
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulative.
