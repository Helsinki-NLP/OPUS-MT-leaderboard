Inflation, in Europe, has shifted over food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was higher than the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg reported.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the United States, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with higher commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "It is necessary to deter inflation" so that it will no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Grain market shares have increased by 88 per cent and soy prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products has also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and, last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will fall from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the master rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fides (Alliance des jes démocrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, he currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institut de suffrage) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of one fifth (20 per cent) for MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Allies of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
On the faithful voters some go to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lower point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it is 41 per cent and 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of spring and summer last year, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is forecasting an increase and only one tenth is forecasting an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of the polled people, a majority who had never seen before in Gallup's polls, found that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of polls have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of the polls wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intent, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would certainly vote and the 20 per cent additional said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. Following current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would make no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education registration fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same percentages among those who expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital travel costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year compared with the fact that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (Day Economy)
This year, in the trade triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown away" in the large food stores last December, did not increase sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that goods purchased well below nine thousand forks last year now cost more than ten thousand forks.
The Daily Shopping Cart in the tested hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand fornts.
And the highest value in the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forks.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey net, nuts and peacock bass have increased significantly.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) data but, at Auchan, there was only one kilo of bread at 139 forints.
Competition has not lowered the product price below 200 forks.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle made up of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forks, so it only cost 257 forks the bottle recorded including.
It does not prevent that this year, in terms of Daily Shopping Cart, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan have increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and the cheapest basket this year, we find a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year's lowest and most expensive basket this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forks.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forks, while aware that the impact of the increase in VAT rate was already seen in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has caused trade to be perplexed, and hypermarkets could not clearly determine how much margin to apply on products so far they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a merchant miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than 1,720 fornts at the 2006 value, whereas the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 fornts.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher than that of last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 fornts as well.
Nearing the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics has seen an increase in prices by more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily Cartel of the latter, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, already quite expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a higher position than egg suppliers because they have managed to make the brutal price increase accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important tails formed in the boxes of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is lower in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the improper use of antibiotics, were registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overhauling of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed for trauma at János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured from a serious car accident came out of the hospital but soon after he had to return because of MRSA infection, and since then doctors have been unable to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National System of Nosocomial Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
That is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacilline-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of the people are carriers of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healing.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in the poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged functioning of the immune system, this bacterium may cause serious hospital infections, such as trauma or septicemia, on the elderly, small weight or weak body.
According to hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital daily.
Above all, you should not confuse infection with the epidemic, you can't find MRSA just the one or you won't look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs resist antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff puts rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA infections may be prevented but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases only see the day if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor at the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the recovery of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, to put on gloves and masks of protection. However, important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemics, the patients should be kept away from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in demonstrably or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditures for social security funds, which is why we are fighting all over this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs too) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of drinking
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was prepared.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who resigned from his position since having crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to drunk or hazy, communicated Friday, Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before turning on the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police station crashed a 55-year-old man who faced him when he turned, with his personal car, on Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(On the other hand, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car that starts a turn has to let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and applied for his retirement because, according to the police, this accident had greatly upset him.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Investigations Department.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated early with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth EUR 400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of the transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, whose credit contracts amounting to EUR 100 million have already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would redeploy the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations in accordance with the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment fee.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market which is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and homes on the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the shores of the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasing to buy in the very expensive corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office areas promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria seek at the same time to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle are buying renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old demolition houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residential buyers (since December, Bulgaria has been cited among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in hopes of achieving a medium- or long-term surplus value.
The price of capital buildings is rising steadily as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which will define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are being held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss exact figures, but were prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level.
Another important issue of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by an Executive Board composed of 16 members likely under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), notified Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of signing the "After 2012 Agreement", and was ready to reduce them by 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments appropriate to their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signing countries of the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time had made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period from 1985 to 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The issue is at large in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place within the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be rejected after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the necessity of which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average Earth temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British army units report on the video sharing site records made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First of all, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who was passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan carry video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the headquarters of the air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londres or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is indisputable
Air force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make public the real objectives of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertising on television, communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have played a game
The army is mad because, except for carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have passed on to the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos had already been broadcast on the net showing the operating areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only been packed for loading these videos recently.
The Americans recruit a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beignets in the ministries
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will be holding an end-of-the-year meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking beets and coffee.
Another department will organize a party with live music, another will delight public servants with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas ambience, concerts and buffet, so much fun is the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the department's employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department plans a budget of 25 million forks to create the end-of-year environment.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forks and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forks and was organized on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice building (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forks, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the tendering company.
The building of the Gaîté Theatre was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a dance on the occasion of St. Luke on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening was not at all compulsory at this dance.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing an over-the-counter party.
The Department of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forts.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and a meal, communicated the press service, and the party will cost as much as 350,000 forks.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forks per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the hour of the holiday taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas feast will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the Department's communication, 1,000 forts per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are initiated by a few welcoming words of the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas celebration.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the celebration at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate Monday strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic stops because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (common transport company) will also strike until 13 o'clock.
The Unions of the League will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be set up and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Fund Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on a follow-up.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, voting on the Health Fund Act is likely to take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike planned for Monday, important stoppages are planned in traffic: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport to Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strike, and the list of trade unions is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations report an indeterminate strike, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungary Iron Roads) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach agreement on minimum services, gold, near Christmas parties, more and more are those taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's public transport will strike from the start of service to 13:00, the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike throughout the country in alternation, the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new approach to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new retirement calculation method to be set up as from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the system to pass the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the Unions of the League, the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning secondary rail lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations may occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Hungarian population of Hungary."
The research institute has added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, with the effect of increasing attention from the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular concerning confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 as "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, in addition, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They noted that everything was done according to the method that, based on the political society and party rancour, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil way.
The emphasis on the civil character and association status is therefore only used to avoid legal traps of registration of these associations in the court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a source of potential risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma troubles that have exploded in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
By taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to set up a guard saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations concerning the constitution of their own custody as a means of resistance points to the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change of risk, they will inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Parties are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the awakenings can rest quietly.
On the other hand, in a year, we have eleven red parties.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as on October 23rd also that is the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is the work party and on November 1 and 2, we remember our family members and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or there remains only one working day before or after the party marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in particular on days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions operating continuously and in service, through their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, working days will be modified only around the end of the year's holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to the experiences most people do rather overtime hours or take vacations they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at their home.
The next year, many parties fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the new year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six silly things that can be awfully annoying for colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that almost bother us: these are things that "pretty" the everyday life of a place of work.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these problems or we are facing the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," said a colleague.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (it is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to consider how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Can you borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
You remember the night before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they're right to be angry with you for scheming their good.
Don't take any envelopes, put them in your pocket because it can be annoying that there's no more and you need them right away.
Do you have the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the spikes that propagating.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the information you share and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even though your colleagues are also aware of it.
You say you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you report yourself sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your missions must be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay with you, don't forget to warn your boss and your colleagues so they won't be surprised about your absence the next day.
Cooling, winding, telephone
You're getting into your job, but are you getting rid of your colleagues?
Have you become, without wanting, a witness to a telephone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with colds, chants, loud discussions (which you lead above their heads), footbeats, big words or discontents expressed loudly.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send an important mail or message, don't blame anyone for that forgetfulness!
Do not put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you've made a mistake and if it's been detrimental to others, fix it!
Ask how you can fix your fault, repair neglect!
You feel too at home at the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not neglect, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing yourself properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet the expectations, you're no longer interesting
We move slowly into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm soundin'.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of the entire hour, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast Zagar's Wings of Love song.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap is different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new style of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alliance of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was given the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season.
The early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine won2 cited their first 2002 album among the fifty largest records of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also compete in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became undeniably "trandy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted the right way, he released a new and better disc.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pecs de Balázs Zságer.
We are here well with reference to flight but next to air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, which has recently spread popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the tunes of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
It's all right, then (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term for music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two casts in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Music is said to be alternatives, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can be honest too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit irrespective of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Outside, especially west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of a decade or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they believe it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course I am happy to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve an objective but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works but is perceived only in the inseparable changes at the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you wouldn't be any more interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made a career rather west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though some people sometimes try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in the other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music should be compared to that of Yonderboi because there are many of us leaving his group and taking another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmarès of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style did you consciously open up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to soften the sound orgy and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kitzora, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece already existed in an instrumental version for a long time, and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The ensuing agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same song the girls learned last night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me back then, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's brief solo), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were behind the stage too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little our ego, forget that comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs has made you the most work?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the musical creation process we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "leaved" this disc.
Right now, this is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfides billions at risk because of its inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
Thus his former employee the French giant the Société General, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost almost €5 billion because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear him report to the police.
However, if one is concerned with Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have produced a profit at the end of last year amounting to EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a million euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "subprime" mortgages, given to low-income customers or those who had experienced reimbursement difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he has, of course, not kept anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses that he has failed the reports so that he is not being tracked.
He managed to dupe his superiors, although the Eureka stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did his will come from to risk so much?
He has attained his position only gradually.
He began working at the General Society in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary revolved around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader's assistant and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my university course and my career and personal course," said Kerviel investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Through the Allianz actions, he won half a million euros by putting down this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"When I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
It was then that the coup of the beginning of the year came about.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," concludes Kerviel.
Chechnya on the occasion of achieving 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government Ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czechia can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion krona from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit for the most part, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
But later he was released and lived in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending between 1997 and 2002, will be re-incarcerated for the time being, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let German finish his sentence at home, or he will be in prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
They were fictitious societies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that German had created to fund its election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way it is.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority government without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote on the declaration of defiance to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
This is some kind of paradox.
Whether it is desired or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why more attention is given to it in the media.
The debates of political men are of much greater interest to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three problems that the current budget is not able to address at the same time:
The first being the significant share of the mandate costs imposed by the law, not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent coalition of the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that is the biggest issue.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real delayed bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, disproportionately indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they were able to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are concerned, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD does not fail to sell.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they became increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls primarily on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are the least at risk of poverty.
We therefore do not need any massive social programmes that have, in the past few years, unfortunately inflated unnecessarily.
Although one has succeeded in eliminating some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, if a shift from the age limit for retirement, and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only be administered.
Simply exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats by mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary costs rescinded by mandate costs.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not cleared all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it is able to collect in tax and tax rights, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through a system of auctions, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this point in cooperation, to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to clients of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unreimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be pursued," said ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central Banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession that could affect economic growth worldwide.
The Central Banks made this choice after failure to lower the interbank rate of Londrès, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, even though the US, Canadian and English Central Banks had dropped their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a new decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks approach will help to avoid the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: the debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to harm especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism was expressed at the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he commits himself to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions."
Interested persons can now read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that, although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and evaluating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics, and he is also an economist.
The main findings of the book are the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of the book are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are not too important or too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are useless, inefficient and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified views on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities can issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their license to drive mainly those who no longer want to drive.
While the communes report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are filled with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, almost 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request release within a short time limit of five days.
In this case, the driver shall pay an additional of five hundred kroner.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will enter the road without a valid permit, will be liable, as from January, to a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, he was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
By doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and to impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanselka, no one is liable to fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exception.
People who no longer want to drive should issue their driving licenses.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers charged with conniving with David Berdych's gang, respectively, will be 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court has therefore sentenced them permanently by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk for 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently waiting for the first instance's verdict.
However, he has already been sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty of holding-up 19 persons, and today the High Court dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the defendants questioned the accusation by claiming it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohème Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 per cent of the larcine to Opava and Koňařík.
The prosecution dealt with the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, which has, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the power of a public agent and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegal guns held, shells with a steel core, a laser direct-shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other high-handed flights Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from the neighborhood of Berdych are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
For the time being, the main hearing has prevented Tomáš Pęta and Maroš Šulej from being held in custody in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of replacing children: 12 million
The lawyer of the suffered families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation from Třebíč hospital for 12 million crowns plus costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the time of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We're going to check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded one million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subjected to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better borne by men, although they have been faced with regrets that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women remain less serene in the face of trauma at present and in the face of what is happening precisely at this time has summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave to each family at the end of October 100,000 kroner for the reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Chechnya are obliged by law to insurance in civil liability.
In the event of a failure, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Until now, the courts had recognized relatively little compensation, and the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute about the Valašské království brand (the Valašsko Kingdom).
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, he had for the first time used the title King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic about the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko Kingdom evoke this actor and comic to everyone.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who for the first time used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no connection with the plan to establish a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of making passports of Valašské Království appear.
From a humorous action at the outset there was a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even offered the owners of the balances on the price of his farm visit and theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the bare idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project intensely.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under Harabiš's inspiration, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court reject today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the kings' parade in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, and the quality of speed change, driving and manufacturing could, in many respects, be classified as inferior to average.
At present, however, the successor of Peugeot 207 is far better.
All the more so that the combo named SW is still going a step further, I just have to think about it better.
When I was testing the classic hatback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining about, for example, the space for the head on the back seats.
As this concludes the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's see quick.
I'm going to mention the interior very quickly so I won't be over and over again.
This is a very successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or too short files is revolutionised.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the size of the bodywork is also sensitive here.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head mentioned above disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is therefore its luggage hold.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy frame.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, it makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabiana Combi, the most sold vehicle in this category in Czechia.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we can see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, with a difference of 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a pushback, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to point out the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box left after the overturning of the back seats perfectly straight, or a very low walkway.
120 horses distributed over four cylinders
The vehicle we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatback work.
It is quiet, it consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression that I have a leak pot blocked by a snakebrush, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329 900 Kč is still valid.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
In addition, we have equipped with head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic glazing, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to Fabian's price and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's only one left to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is a problem
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concern among residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the conflict between residents and immigrants of Slovak origin is beginning to increase, well illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The fights, the Chicane and the fights between the students have moved into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The guilty woman defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her by racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant conducted by two teenagers.
The girls had allegedly turned to this man racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started cracking at us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," he described another unpleasant adventure of a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify for conflict with immigrants to fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between residents of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can be accomplished if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in its entirety but also enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built at the beginning of the 20's.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mafia, built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s, circulated on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the National Hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars always travel to Havana, since the jigsaws and the old imported winds have long been in such a salty and wet climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is markedly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has a green light.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended into the sugars on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives, which are not only in museums, can be seen in operation.
Where to direct his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the best known places.
There is therefore no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise remember that in Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone floor.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candles from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile soil that has been taken into their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is likely to be grown of the best quality.
You can find the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness became incarnate in the beauty and character of this small city.
Coloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pondějšími francouzskými osadníky, if čtyři staletí teměřř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain mass of Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolition anything either, everyone just had a roof over his head.
If we have more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see interesting places in the surroundings, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucres valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after sunset and where music is provided only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village in the Far East of Cuba as the most beautiful one on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has placed the east team of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus's pilgrimage) and from the hill where the former castle is held and the current El Castillo hotel, we see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, mountain mass Sierra Maestra, the sow bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropical cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled in a number of pages.
Only, as we say right, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, the Americans claim
The lack of necessary soldiers and equipment affects, according to the United States, the mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going as it should, and the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed to Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States has called through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates the NATO troops for greater activity this week, Britain sees as priority the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development assistance.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but the military power can only form part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC chain.
Eighty-ten percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to American army data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO Jaap of Hoop has said similar things today.
"I'm not happy about what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about eighty percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Which is passive
The last few months also exist among the countries involved in conflict on the issue if all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its liabilities.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the combat requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun has this week qualified German soldiers as lazy.
"The wealthy Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," wrote Sun in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counterattack by publishing the photo of a British troops during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The government's debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 kroner is the responsibility of each Czech.
The total debt was raised to 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of improved state budget savings, the Department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
As of June, however, it has declined by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its government debt data from early October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is the responsibility of each Czech.
Over the past year, the state indebted more than 111 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, one could cross the border of one billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion kroner," said Patria Finance Analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in the course of 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debt grows
The debt of the State is the debt of the central government and is mainly caused by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government's debt is financed by treasury bonds, pension securities, direct borrowings or, for example, by borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt has increased from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The State's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average government debt requirement was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, in view of the current health of the economy, too high.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the pension securities where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a matter of negotiation when pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than expected
As a result of the Government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion krona this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to the improvement in government budget savings, the Department has reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the state budget, which clearly reaches 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion kroner.
Next, these are the maximum sources planned for the Czech consolidation agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion kroner and the repayments of European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
Today she was standing before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a bear in a wig
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum court on Thursday night and to expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of having allowed students between the ages of 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a whipping sentence.
This 54-year-old British institute in office at the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with the attack on Islam and the siege, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students with the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear picture followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any labels with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher in the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," it is only an "innocent error".
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Let's remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second name most often given in Britain, he writes English in 14 different ways.
This first name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence in the immediate future, but we enter a very difficult period," he added, pointing out that "clear pressures exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika was responsible for a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on further negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of EU administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council did not vote in his favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found", announced Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden where these "last chance negotiations" took place on Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible, cautioning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says to redouble a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia insisted that any decision should return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
“Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: to the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held in Annapolis on Tuesday, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed immediately to engage in negotiations with a view to finalizing the dispute between their two peoples of 60 years old.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties' obligations to the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, cited "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to making the forthcoming talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to wind them up in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for the implementation of its co-existence-based "two-State vision" of Palestinian and Israeli States.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in that sense of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in his interview with the daily Arab-speaking Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in each case in this diverse type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN) investigation, a police car was operating on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, so not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circulated "to very bright breath".
“She hit the police car on her left, after a right-wing refusal,” said one police officer.
The control of alcoholism on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before being thrown out, star windshield, bumpy bumps) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted persons at risk" at the IGPN, which is a Cossia with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGN investigation, at this stage, removed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of scratch, probably caused by rubble on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained closed as long as the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would soon have left the place, thus not providing help to the two young people.
The GNP, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "all serious errors" regarding this point.
"It is one aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of these few moments following the accident.
One of his windows giving precisely on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to get them back, this witness says.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely ferred cop, who was boxing.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth one was on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that people were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues arriving at the scene.
Still according to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," said the prosecutor.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers protesting against emergency measures were injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, wounding police.
At least 350 lawyers have been sued.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been called in.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president '' exhorted the people to send flowers to the judges who acted against the state of emergency and the detritus to those who took an oath before Musharraf''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly covered by the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was due to decide on the legality of the re-election to the presidential on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was expelled and replaced.
''All we are witnessing is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's judgments,' said the magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president 'no more' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He left his military uniform until 15 November, the date of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of the Army.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still show a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
However, the liberalisation of contraception has enabled a better "control of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
View calculated next month for a couple in five and if possible in spring, season considered the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would take more than seven hours to work in space at astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is essential for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its length, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "brickled" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Tuesday while the astronauts had unloaded Discovery from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room that would soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for the laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
Therefore, the second task of the crew was to move a power generation module by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, to position it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the re-deployment of the module's solar panels with a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged about one meter by a cable that stuck.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracle at the end of 30 meters in length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space marketer) of the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very proper, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was responsible for operating the "injured" solar panel.
After specifically inspecting the damage, he selected the wrong cable and installed "attacks" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker that remained near his home and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "brickled" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making inventory of its tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return to Discovery for a return to scheduled Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply at the Paris stock exchange, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to cope with the A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its operational outcome forecast for 2007 as a result of the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which will condition the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of covering the delay in delivering his military aircraft, announced in October, is ''€1.2 billion to €1.4 billion, more than €1 billion for Airbus''', announced the home of the European EADS manufacturer.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result objectives (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, adding no more quantified details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads related to the delays of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very blocked campaign.
Three days from the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends the voters a television message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
It does so as the leading list of Russia united, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without hanging," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
It denounces a campaign of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there was "never such a dirty election, even in the time of Eltsine."
After the crackdown on last weekend's demonstrations, the former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the sovieticus homo mentality"
Behind these open-ended legislations are two questions that are much more open:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the first round of the presidential on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight a third consecutive mandate.
But no successors emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and the powerful united Russian party that would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both the legislature and the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mindset of the Soviet homo, they don't feel the masters of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada independent centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back: civil society has slowed down in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit slowed down the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutin has renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "disclaim personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What is it good to think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 leaders of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists.
Conclusions of 54-year-old professor Tamara Techerednitchenko: "What good is thinking about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were so far available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, upon request of an old victim or his entitled.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been complete and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "including on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public's opening of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
Records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to give them proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Universityät Technische in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, domestic bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion per annum.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath indicated.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission last April to enter into negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A pact for free trade between the two economies enormously" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Duraro Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday that it was concerned to alleviate the current return of credit concerns, and announced a ten billion pound offer at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of an open market operation of five weeks," she said in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12h15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE puts on the liquidity market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These normally take place at one week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was Wednesday 5.829%.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England has had a significant penalty rate that had dissuadeed banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, supported by the evolution of the book price compared to the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss on Thursday articles of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Power, which was equivalent to rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist "nife" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the reinstatement of the floating TIP, a transport cheque or the management of rents.
Having voted against the examination of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was brought up following the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The head of PS Members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Melvin Benn's British producer's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has, no less or less, inspired the current festival movement in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Melvin Benn's Republic Festival, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to its portfolio and in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" to which he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event festival.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have become involved in politics because of the current administration, followed by Charlie Jones.
"We were able to talk with Melvin Benn, and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having emerged in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours take place in urban green spaces," said Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in Europe and urban America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, eagerly supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been made to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will be rocky, but music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners who received the Top Independent Award Promote the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film boards to Montreal when no other than Terminator is opposed...
This seduction mission is part of the role of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where she's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer those they will judge best," he says.
The festival race
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be from all festivals in the West Coast, whether from Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The age of darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally in stock exchange? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and waiting for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market generally has a positive behaviour.
However, statistics-based forecasts should not be made, since given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least on the short term ".
Although they are not supporters for the stock exchange to take on momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is nourished by liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternative with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leaking to quality values in both long periods and short periods".
For this reason, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decrease in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulation of inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, who is in charge of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4 per cent since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur each year during these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, Analyst of Investis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Investis Banco ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they move into it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that the other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions in December was a kisser month.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock market emerged from the crisis caused by the growth of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for now Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds on its end-of-year rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 open offices from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the People Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract self-employed customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street businesses chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies established throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the hours is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colours.
The bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but employs staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have room for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers', says Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with outside staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco's delegate advisor, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he was leading doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect of his joy was tarnished: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased but that we have lowered', he said.
However, he emphasized that on a low market, 'we have declined'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain has stabilized its loss to 15.66% for one year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who sold 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% decrease since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Five Days) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become this year's first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this data to be actual, the television channel is expected to record an increase of 3.6% for the current fiscal year in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net billing of antenna 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important payout he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in projected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of earnings from Antenna 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

1.
Ibersecurity recommends purchasing both values based primarily on its high profitability of dividends and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulating) better than Antenne 3 (maintaining) for 'multiple attractions ' and increased business.

JPMorgan: it recommends that the two cases be examined as it has had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote by Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the organization's activities to ensure that markets operate effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation among the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial advisory services for both specialized social reasons and natural and legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FAIs), which merge value companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of operations systems on financial instruments, so that it can be added to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, to facilitate control by the NCMV.
In passing through the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments were added, one of which shows that held debts will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which demonstrated itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the administration's transposition to legally delineate the functions that graduates in the economy may have 30 years after it was approved in 1977, the Royal Decree delineating the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services for product marketing and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14th.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of the Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In all cases Solbes has stated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less of a surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Minister of the Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped to more than 50% up to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he had a few record deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that had gradually fallen in two and a half months because of his clients' mistrust and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government had offered and would continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to get these remaining 18 billion pounds until it reaches the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Mogant Group, known for its campaigns to create advertising in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, to which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from the bank route.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the Chief of Police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of May last Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the mayorate, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'manor' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of further arrests is not allowed within the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, a prime suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the MP's lawyer 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession concerning the plot.
Furthermore, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collapse of Morales' commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Tolede and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono is "one of the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist group who will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Mr. Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, which issued on 15 November his decision not to appear in the next general elections and to abandon his political career in the fight against climate change in the university.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even though citizens already know who the economic vice-president will be if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or cry" and to make it more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted on some occasions."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "sound of knowledge" and he did not want to do as if he already occupied his position to not fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to relentless persecution both to the sceptics of its predictions and to those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach compels him to explain why his Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading European Union in the non-implementation of Kyoto protocols.
Who are responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors has occurred, and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we have to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is to say, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no and there will be no explanation.
Exactly because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening for businesses and individuals.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous to Zapatero that he hurriedly denied it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, which does not denounce and which does not demand, adorns meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim that we move in bicycles or we cool off with the fan.
The Mayor and Chief of Totana Local Police arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Mayor and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at the moment many officials met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of Sol Industry and Housing.
These three judgments are added to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Tribunal No. 1 instructs.
The first six prisoners were now brought to justice.
According to sources, the previous Totana municipal councillor and currently independent MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Immonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots were made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, which could have played the middle role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that had been re-qualified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the parking lot of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment of yesterday published in the most important newspaper in Finland (some of the leading PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the philosophy course has challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the school in Jokela.
The guilty of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Counsellor, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written on the pages of daily Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague will pass on information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you fly a car and pay it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month sentence to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and CD traffic would involve a six-month penalty to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone exaggerates.

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on foreign research entitled 'Money produces brain activation, especially if others receive less money'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Institute Life&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when the two people were supposed to receive the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague for eight years.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead -, the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at liberty.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the Carla' list (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who continues the criminals on the run and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, implies a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the use in fact, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be ensured or the actual use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely an accident is, the higher the rate to be paid.
That is why people over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims than they are careful.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the insurer's characteristics, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various drawbacks when a contract is made with insurance at an accessible price, as can be the low driving experience and the old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be well-secured is insurance at all risk, other more economical options exist.
The most likely drivers can opt for insurance at any risk honestly, so that they obtain coverage from insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the claim that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," states Luis Noguera, the responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be cautious and avoid the damage to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's base rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and the profit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the bonus," Noguera clarifies.
Beyond the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers when entering into a contract with insurance, as the rate of claims is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is preferable to choose insurance at all risk honestly.
"Usually young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the European company manager in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at any risk, since his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of claims, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at all risk with free (may be EUR 300), or insurance to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed drive and they have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, insurance at all risk with free will is preferable (in the case of EUR 150), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible claims, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighth final
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scottish to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not go ahead with it.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the sixth day is over, since Milan AC has to fight the semi-finals of the World Club Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the 16th December final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to win out victorious, since the Italians will not wish to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would be first and ensuring a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not only be able to computer on this because with nine points the game goes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week at Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the Scottish evening, which has good hope of ranking for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth finals to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although he is last and unable to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "bright".
About 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video telling the story of the group that got angry in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincides with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines ' and 'Voodoo ', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are mounted on stage by showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
Sporty Spice ', which was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate it very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters were waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be shown in California, USA, San José(December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be shown in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine makes the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (E) are driven by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian property monopoly company providing the gas, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve, for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most gas passes," announced Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the press agency Reuters.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major change between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies for Ukraine.
This has led to the decline in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under developed.
Consequently, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its outside community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the oversight committee said.
The warning of the General Revisor, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at the June Glasgow airport.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas people he employed.
His report also highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The reviewer-general carried out checks on outside community personnel following the attack at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after darkening with his jeep, at the gates of the main terminal.
He was part of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, because they suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on offshore staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer general's report now states that the committees are required to deal with the previous criminal control office, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have found out that some information about staff has been well verified, this is not done at all."
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health is carrying out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some members of the offshore staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that pre-employment checks currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported using 1161 people from overseas, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
However, the reviewer general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems relating to the identification of staff with indeterminate contracts, which could choose to remain in our country or not.
The investigation has shown that the current health authorities' controls procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for staff members outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government associated with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including those from overseas.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio peak on Joy Division's last singer, Ian Curts, has raised 5 awards, including the best film, to the British Independent Film Oscars.

Ray Winstone, renowned for his performances as a coriander character, won the Richard Harris award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has filmed such films as Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Crane.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award in honour of star Harris, star star actor Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiral in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of stage makers, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia Block 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells who were handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergy and armed forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters launched a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight activists, led by a foreign resident planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning against the band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appeared to have plotted the assassination of clergy and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Allied Muslim Shiite government in the United States, considered as heretic according to the hard line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergy have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by the appeals against the pro-West Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces during the five... last months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among prisoners, 16 members of Medina are organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostatized Muslims.
Of the prisoners, 32 are accused of subsidizing militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European vessel in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could have even been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation linked to a slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt the lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of Physics Department of Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a living area."
Uranium enriched by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Again open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn't up to being a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their issues submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the outcome of another debate by You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected a lot of the conditions of the Republican party, who is a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard fun things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates were expressing themselves roughly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the important anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term of office as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote an "amnesia" (offering the clandestine a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, it can be because they started to fight immigration before and more incitingly than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears toward the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in their noses should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in the pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When he insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to appear in the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's rebound in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research of subsidies carried out by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistle-blowing during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties fail to agree to decide who is the best known and most traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party in good time and convincingly with a successful message on American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend in British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices from politicians, no extra dirty marital toe.
But here is a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went backwards in his election project, insulting the British intelligence declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's bailout, a bank on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a failure of directives and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative stock.
A trio of retired generals has launched a revolt among the Lords, protestant against reductions in military spending: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is a part-time job for them.
Currently, the suspicion of crazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Workers (and his former chief of oversight) made them have had to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound to head towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the ministers' offices are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was a British treasurer.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation of the party's funds "money counting for the members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she looks like it.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party make him believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or fraud.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the major subsidisers of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, not knowing that this was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the responsible for the collection of grants that had mentioned dubious donations in October.
But until now Mr. Brown has not been involved: Nothing suggests that he has been aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power was based on something he knew well, making use of a committee of inquiry on this subject made up of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is from the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent public life standards committee, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial aspects of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his particular financial relationship with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it's normal to see sharp fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal banking resulted in an abrupt fall in bank-route archives, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to become worse.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to pay.
and trust in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the programming volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct linkages between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, debt by credit card would become a priority to repay everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go to testify to their roles in relation to fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged collusion fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation initiated following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were made against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the debauchery of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, known as the "three of Natwest" claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the scener of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to cheat on banking procedures.
By the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But really these $20 million went to the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the debauchery of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow spent six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million security each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, on a bank route in December 2001 after years of accounting scams, could no longer hide its billions of debts or even propose its bidon speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither in nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is just a little change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more of a family use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday, at the Millionaires Show, an orgy of consumer incentive, for four days, which stands in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from docks to cars filled with diamonds such as 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked at a brilliant orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's largest spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth of $282 billion, according to Forbes listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires, which are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research.
(World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, which is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time in company with the Russian distributor, Le Grupo Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the salon, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grabbed her high-cut dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems to focus primarily on the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the caps to come up to a huge warehouse where there are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canies, Mövenpick ice, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund wig bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch Delf porcelain, in front of a wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles, hand made.
"It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already passed off from the sparkling logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold in the trade fair.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, hang out every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and inlaid cotton of gold yarn.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also reported selling to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalises luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"if you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind," he said.
"there is more than you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company built four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team has printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire trade show.
Passersby arrested to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this fake wealth or impounding a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr.Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Code on West Scott Avenue.
Then comes the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, that the police have not yet identified, resident on 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are confident, the results of the toxicological tests that will, unfortunately, take time, but which should solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
McCarthy stated that Miss Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from the county union prosecutor's office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine if Melle Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had arrived around 15 hours.
and have found Misse watering on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh could not confirm whether Miss Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical firm.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Miss Castro's where a spooked rose rests in the narrow cemetery front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue canon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bikes all ground attached to the sides.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate into the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"she said "you have to pay attention to this," he said.
"she was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the global stock exchange's effervescence.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm the credit conditions, thereby reducing the interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, number 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets affected.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market by the end of September and October.
If this turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the American economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been increased following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to lost betting on real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londres where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% reaching 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In Londres, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, reaching 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
In the past, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in markets has been highlighted in response to the strong demand for a monthly auction from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject additional funds into London financial markets resulting in credit tensions has caused the UK banks to have their highest growth since September 6,59% since November 12.
England faces a call for judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Selection Officers who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, to make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the President General of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national selector, at least in part-time.
The one who will not succeed in winning the N°6 back will be bad luck, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck more than due to lack of ability.
There is not only in the cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is this just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubeby"?; both, new managers who have obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room only for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a cricket unless at least one chance is given?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer it again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's going to play at Asgirya Stadium, that's just an opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricket of the Test, and that despite the fact that his double hundred marks against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgirya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will encourage Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, its brilliant and considerable start at the 88-test innings in Bombay, 32 cents first class compared to six for Bopara, which is at the age of 22 years younger, and its excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Midlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently capped on a 4x4 at a Volkswagen presentation, sponsor of England.
He carried only slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask him if "he saw this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, its flowing breath allows him to perform services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the true art of selection?
I would be happy to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spilling these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has recovered normality.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have driven them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported on convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents the Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him in to inform him that the United States-aided militia, allowed him to chase Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he encouraged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to put in place an Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obedi.
Many say they have been attracted by the increasing calm of the capital since the arrival of the American troops, and in view of the continuing formation of well-armed "groups of citizens" and working with the American military to defend their neighbours.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past few years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion expressed by all regarding the visas for exiles that Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the sectarian death squadrons.
"We didn't have any problems until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence may be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis were driven from Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions were lower.
It is feared that sudden flows of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State conducts vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest Federated State, by self-desirsion, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double or even triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in higher than the average - many of them without a gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," said Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five students earn their degrees in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
So the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is Germany's second best.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education in Sardinia has forced schools above a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests into the entire federal state.
In order for children to start learning early, the last year of daycare is free of law - a model that in the meantime other Federated States also copy.
Only future comparison studies will show whether the performance of students improves in a sustainable manner.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the proportion of students at risk was reduced by 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other Federated States.
The Bavarians get better.
And despite sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - but can gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez Regulates the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tic-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will have the half-hour stopwatch remounted in the South American country.
Chavez is now becoming a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, as a result of a new law, the watches will be arranged within four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw in Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crushed the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain too Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ring is furious in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (because you don't like it) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant demands of the left populists and who told him to shut up.
A decrease in wages threatened Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to a forecast, a real decrease in wage is threatening German employees this year.
Experts cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll from the previous year in 2007.
"The fault lies in the low growth of wages, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economy and Research on Environment, in the journal "Bild".
New employment insurance charges could also be used for the employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected drop in unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and hydrocarbons had increased the inflation rate at its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now shown evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California to Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprint, the lightnings would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If there was a life, it must have been on a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps Earth's infernal twin, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which resembles so much the earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the mission ASE.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, since no more probes were on the way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight Venus' uniqueness within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than expected at first sight.
Thus, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, researchers found a cloud-float at the south pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, wrote a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 km, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 territorial days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost itself in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide was fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler called for the end of the party's quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and I am in the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organise a new China policy.
The German Chancellor did not take her distance with the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly made his discontent known about the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular of the CDU's "frontier policy" on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritations became felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only commissioned German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, it also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of foreign ministers in both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those in France.
Street fights with police, fires, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, the German Minister of Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers who shoot police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) feared similar developments in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not form a part of our home, and that it decomposes into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" who appeared in Hanover.
Not all young people could get away with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the summits of integration to the conferences on Islam, it already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been engaged in serious street fights with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, public cars and buildings burned.
More integration efforts on the part of the German government, that is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the share of unemployed people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
Above all, more training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, added that social control in families was more important in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be careful."
Youth should not be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlamps.
The authorities in office reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young men had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopian scene of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and there is nothing left to wait for.
In which country does this chancellor live justly?
After his disquieting speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of concentrating too much on politics was pushed by Angela Merkel by a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made it clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a heavy-duty politician, who fled into foreign politics and who even stayed there slowly.
For example, climate protection: in this area, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having also little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it cramps into all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
This way she destroys her image of pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this respect, it is revealing the number of times when she makes slips when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starters to pronounce a specific half sentence.
It is in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the debate of Youtube of Republican presidential candidates, both favors Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now they have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates already bursts on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestine," reproach Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against his side with heavy reproach: "I would say that his own house was a hare for clandestine people" replied Giuliani and reproach the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are going to attack: since the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates are primarily using discussions on CNN to discredit their opponents.
30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via Youtube are just more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain throws his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also taught vigorously by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called the Waterboarding method, a method of interrogation where the drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and discussions on torture is reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented or future increases in taxes are refused, applause goes to the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites appear again.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney, "commiting and apologizing to the base and to the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes through a flowing knot when he is asked his opinion on literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time as a civilian.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armies, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military rule end.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasts live the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had passed on his position as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had therefore turned to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with jurists of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the chief of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s rejoined: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" appeared.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and first his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, throne in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked on the left of Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the whole auditorium, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodeelius curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes this is added inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to be too disturbing to the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has ensured some emotions among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasoned in the collective memory of pop, but in no case so long as this group has been so painfully lacking for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends in the 1970s?
Especially since the so-called "Krautrock" has been more and more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the room the German pop faces interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panhegyrical praise, the wonder was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was jumping on the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of self-ignorance and transfiguration in the unknown is the only and only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the basements below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly set up in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
About 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideologically than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called in the trash was a fan of the Choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmony far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modical as music sounded, the group suffered material poverty.
The harvest of dead wood was not for himself.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Grisesem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother expressed at that time the desire to force Harmony to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Roth landed in the spheres of esotericism and made his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster relives in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the Griesm Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set itself the aim of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's sentence is in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar cable tools are used to form the legend.
In front of that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to pull instruments from the Inuit sounds through the instruments with built-in effects.
Electronic music today is similar to electronic music.
The three of them in great technical fixtures.
At this very moment the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been rocky.
The roots were less searched in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68" is not totally wrong, and also Harmonia is now no longer irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start, and where does it end?
It can hit someone's nerves (?) or give escape moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Matriterial Peace", two films again address the Balkan war.
But they're both not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too teary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: although the Karadzic and Mladic war criminals are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, it is precisely there, in the most dismal back country of the Bosnia War, that actor Richard Gere was found at that time.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice and futile roles in women's feelings films and too many press conferences on the issue of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films must be as long and confused as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of eye-witnesses: in the background, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not as kind: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this effort, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Matriterial Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless suite of missed films on the Balkan war.
"Matriterial peace" can be done quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar Franks, in which one of them falls in love immediately.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented for once as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of foolish shootings.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good film on the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioning themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", may have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard) at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories are strikingly similar: two males go into small teams in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also assign him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was killed later on.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes permanently bad, when, within the last five minutes, it is postponed by an accelerated process, that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for fair revenge to Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime in The Hague should be seized against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (where they have to be exceptionally agreed) do not drive the hunt quite intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good willful and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem from Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compacting, I see the veins of the swollen forehead, clearly: how tired it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumbling heads, but insinuating how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were of great flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films on South Africa.
What's worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis home or on a field of mines, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Genesis go Grezen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be too close over time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could play a good film on the holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still have to mature - those who today are classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no case been unanimously celebrated at their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we know that today too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it pleased the screenwriters the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" have in fact become so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin still did not know how far the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war of the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
"The great cities will always be awfully dangerous, the men will always be horrified and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has been confronted by critical virulents in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust said to WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the time period that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A abandonment of the candidacy would be further in contradiction with the statements of the Chief of the Senate on the occasion of the German Federation's plenary meeting of higher schools of sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's candidacy at the University of 2015 as being "not a substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past few weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD portion accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Small Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had, however, broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' boxes.
The one who connects Sweden's concepts with wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or what if?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the eighty-ten Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm results today in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is closed, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had given proper permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as Brillo-Boxes originals of Andy Warhol authorized, with the term "Type Stockholm".
Some of these have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed that about a hundred wooden cassettes had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have given it up.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén cassettes were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a paint brush to white oil.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 shows, on the contrary, that the painting has been applied directly without background on the laminated panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official Brillo-Boxes list of Andy Warhol," said the Director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not follow another decision, the Moderna Museet will rank the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "worst accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been there for an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila and had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power had recently taken up the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to an attempted putsch missed in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the hearing to burst suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers, who normally had to monitor them, apparently had deserted him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal forces in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command before the Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other military units wanted to join the march shortly.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption complaints for months.
The financial district of Manila has already been the theatre of the attempt to mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at puttingsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured more than 20 percent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a bargain before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versailles.
With this step we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5% to 15.1%.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, we tell on the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired nearly 10 percent participation in the mobile company Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed in the Stock Exchange 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation on the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a spokesperson from United Internet.
Both companies founded the company in partnership with MSP to absorb the Freenet competitor.
At the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and not to use their right to add 18.49 percent more to Freenet, United Internet Thursday said.
However, the two companies would leave themselves open to all options, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it has been learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The yet difficult poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch held direct participation in Freenet by 6.01 per cent so far.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to purchase 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
