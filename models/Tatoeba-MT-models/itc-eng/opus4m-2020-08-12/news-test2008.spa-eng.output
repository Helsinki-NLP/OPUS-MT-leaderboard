European inflation has slipped into food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying increase in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the EU Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely to give 3 percent - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, together with the increasing prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "trade" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, beat the record by twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation took place in the euro area as a result of the massive food and energy prices.
End-of-wheat contributions increased by 88 per cent and so did soybean contributions reach their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and milk products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching the black gold by almost $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent current to 2.5 per cent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup had never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of safe party voters - due to the greater firmness of opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth for socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seats: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there is one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As regards next year, the majority of the population is experiencing deterioration and only one-tenth of the population expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, more than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government was doing something wrong than his duties.
13 percent of the consultants trust or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population did not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent did not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators for shaping the political situation is that, what proportion of society believes it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 per cent felt it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question about participation responded that it would certainly participate and another 20 per cent said that it is likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 per cent of the population would participate safely, and another 15 per cent believed likely their participation. Based on current voters' intentions there is no doubt of the result of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has fivefolded its prices
They maintained the average price increase of 16 percent of Budaörs' gold trade triangle hypermarkets, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trade triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the thousand HUF.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already "disappeared" so there was no drastic increase in percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what last year was able to buy at a price well below the 9,000 HUF, today they cannot even buy for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices in the basket of Napi.
Comparing the most expensive basket values last year with the cheapest basket this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas in prices there was an increase in VAT.
This process was precisely the one that destroyed trade, supermarkets visibly were unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of movement of a product poorly, he may lose an important benefit on the margin that is adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only of 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price of today has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest has also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent the price of consumer items of first-needed consumption grew.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some food of first need, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, just 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, bringing preserved foods by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, in the three shops big tails were formed in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that domestic sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to polling institutes because income is below their plans and not only in the case of food but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been reported in hospitals primarily due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The circumstances of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overburdening of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the chief doctor of the department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A wound in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention by the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10, this year, there have been cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 - said Karolina Böröcz, department doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that the number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, and there is no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methylin-oxacylin.
One third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amygdalitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once excessively or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become very antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly become infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as injuries or septicemia first of all to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened body, elderly or low weight individuals.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of Hospital János there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection with the epidemic should not be confused, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic-resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff cares for them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA.
However, in Hungarian hospitals microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come into public light when the infections of MRSA are already visible in the patient - said the department doctor-head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union strongly commends the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples is even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
It saves itself with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in hand-washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this sense there are significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is infected through drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated for at least a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation saves themselves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of disease with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to have success, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholemia by the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the 21st district police commander.
It is possible to exclude the possibility that he was driving drunk or in a troubled state since then the dismissed commander of the 21st district police, who, on Tuesday, ran and caused the death of a transeunt - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson for the Attorney General ' s Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case has been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then head of the 21st district police station, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle, bending to Kossuth Lajos Street in the 21st district, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian zone.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always yield the step by bending.)
The transeunt lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and applied for retirement, according to the police statement, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Procurator ' s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance projects for transport and environmental protection in the Hungarian budget, which will be financed from cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit contract worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungarian objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for €50 million for innovations, which the budget will employ primarily for the University of Debrecen innovation and research project.
During the discussions they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalises with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again address the issue that if it is necessary or not modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate paradise
It is admirable that the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country, which has been mentioned recently.
What, where and those who buy on the EU's cheaper market, will quickly grow?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Dorada Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia may be attractive, and trade and office spaces promise a rapid return on investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and this may also be a prominent destination during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to install here buy new or renovated properties for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and they also need the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of cottages (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
They constitute the third group real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of buildings significantly exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at the expert level will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world discuss the Bali Roadmap, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, established in the Kyoto Protocol, which was in force until 2012.
Discussions are currently taking place on the particular issue between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures for the time being, although it tends to agree that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emission of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are prepared to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also reached on aid for developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a steering board consisting of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes "Piac è Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and the developing countries are also willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed themselves to decrease by 5.2 per cent, including 15 EU Member States then committed to reaching 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 per cent the greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1985-87, which our country will fulfil - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
This is a great deal of what is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will have to be signed in the long term, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, as assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, which was called upon in its most recent report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the United Nations that deals with climate change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would result in a delay in reducing emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C of the earth's average temperature, which according to scientists would have irreversible and immeasurable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish footage of filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These tapes made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Already there are 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 as "headquarters defence" and publishes videos of actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Community Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence, they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - told the BBC the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the carefully edited and censored recordings, amateur videos appear in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak at most of the losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently taken advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with videogames of shootings, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tomb and pastrylet salted at the Christmas feast of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Monaco Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with salad cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with trumpets and a toast.
Party, Christmas ambience, concerts and buffet - so amuses power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas feast will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
At the Orphan's Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently performing missions abroad will also be invited to receive a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million to the holiday environment of the year.
The National Agency for Development (ANF) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry expected the presence of approximately 300 fifty.
At the party of the wallet will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, they will also act artists and there will be tumbol draw.
ANF's Christmas cost HUF 4,700 000 and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Theatre of the Comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we fail to communicate with the competent person.
You can watch without suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas held the dance of Lucía's day on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them paid nothing for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting words and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to [origo]’s question they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to dress or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not expect her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-the-year working meeting.
The participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department will report - will only have coffee and salad cakes, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, in return, will simply serve with his colleagues in the Ministry's room for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas feast in its own fair of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on 20 January, and Christmas will not be celebrated in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as reported by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions are held every year, begin with a brief address by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas feast - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Working Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stop will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be completely stopped and workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 13 o'clock.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held in conjunction with the National Federation of Working Committees.
The strike commission of the Liga and the National Workers' Union will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will be pronounced in an indefinite strike, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly rejects public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda for Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law may be voted on at very late evening hours, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways you will stop working for indefinite time, in the morning you may stop part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the Volán companies.
At the same time, at many points in the country there will be a closure of half the roads.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas parties are approaching, they are increasingly the people who travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 13 o'clock, the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest airports from 7 to 9 o'clock in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike of the LIGA Trade Unions of Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Teacher Trade Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the 2- to 8-hour Democratic Union of Educators.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and puts a new conception into a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions which will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure that, even before 2010, in the case of early pensions, the possibility of occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport on the railway lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country there is increased risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August of this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
The company's "risk warning" writes: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the fact that "with the worsening of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsies of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic confrontations may occur."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this character - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that all this was due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on existing gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that, starting in the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary has been increasingly promoted and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been established in the country that are self-definite of "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is to say of the State" - they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method which seeks to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
For highlighting civility and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but also is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, over the past 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will be their own guardian.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning on the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász at the news agency's question stated: risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can affect the change of risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning on risks.
The party isn't always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holiday days - that the coming year will be less - are reorganized working days.
Not even in the EU or North America, parties are unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holidays.
The holidays are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
Let us also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest those who spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on 23 October, the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May the work party, on 1 and 2 November we remember our dead relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day parties the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so often they become bridges when there is only one working day before or after the party.
In exchange for extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of work who regulates in his specific decree when you have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public servants.
It is not mandatory, on the other hand, for companies and service institutions that, because of their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be altered around the holidays of the year: from December 24, life is practically stopped in the country, since according to the experiences, most people "make bridges" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will match with mid- or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around the work party so that then, for four days in a row, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that on Friday, May 2nd will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the 23rd of October: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming at the end of the year will be allowed to rest, since from 24 December it will not be worked in almost any place, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small dissuasors to bitterness your colleagues' lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we have never received, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small inconveniences or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they've been looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to an appointment?
At best you feel it and try to fix the matter, you might want to call the marketing department to tell them you forgot to deliver the message (this is the most common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before making a good explanation, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things with which you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office utility or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but for this morning he disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take away anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be mad at you for subtracting their stuff.
Don't take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and get exhausted before time comes.
Do you gossip about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your partner's trust when he shares with you his deepest secrets!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and don't gossip about your partner in his absence, even if others also know about him.
Are you on sick leave unfairly?
When you call the office and say you're sick and you're insufferably sick, you feel bad or better, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your impossible tasks, your work at last.
Don't bother your partner!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to the office or something might happen to you, so you have to stay home, communiques, so your colleagues or boss don't have to confront you the next day.
Tareos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly getting rid of him the laughter of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone conversation that you'd better not listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them above your head), pataloes, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent in a loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening into a project (write, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something on time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't mention the chaos that might possibly reign in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize whether you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too at home at the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Do not be disarranged, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
It sounds like a strange compass on the radio: a violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and to previous tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays Zagar's Wings of Love song.
National music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little change the image and although again it is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are new under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in Yonderboi as a whole until he began his independent career perhaps because they cannot be the protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to win, when they asked him for soundtracks [b4]cinematographical (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that at first it was only in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to be sold also in the Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they like this label.
The set reacted how it should react: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The recently released album, called Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zsager.
It is good the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The disc includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station took to the ears of the radios the loud music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zsager: The definition of selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can emerge from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Outside, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
Not only are the 15-and-twenty generations attending the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that take place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't make music for any purpose, but for some reason.
Rather, the role of the public is felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and did his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with Yonderboi's music, since many of us started our career in their group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people listened for the first time to Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our record.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a chorus in the gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists in good voice from our own national music stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - who was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make up exactly that way the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song the girls later learned.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the disc seems like girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief solo), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not louder than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply due to technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also pours on it, about which we forget for a while our ego, who from where it came from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: To which other job did you dedicate?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to none, but at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything went to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "sold" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A bag runner traitor risks billions for its inferiority complex
A malicious disloyalty.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good abilities.
He has long been intruded, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" he heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what is apparent from Kerviel's responses to French media, such as Le Monde's newspaper, is that it was a man who had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros by the end of last year thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw her coming early in the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the so-called subprime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he declared that he had failed the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk turned into profit
Were you afraid you'd come to find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make you happy."
Where did you get so much will to risk that way?
In my position, we had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
Its annual salary was managed between $51,000.
Two years later he was already a stock marketer's assistant and in 2005 he became a stock marketer with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I was never going to win as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005 already observed that they looked at me cautiously.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described researchers.
But as soon as my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombing attacks in London, playing a 500 million euro title down.
And this was a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you want, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, my eyes were closed."
It was only that after that the blow came at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did they get him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor that doesn't have a vacation is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to take a look at its file," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech Republic Government signed with representatives of the European Commission yesterday a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion krona).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion krona will be released for the regions.
Czech companies can obtain around 100 billion krona from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million kroner.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them less.
Twenty years for the former president of Nicaragua, the court ruled
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal decreed the 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the breakdown of $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Despite this, he was later released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency that, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in line.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will depend on prison officials if they let German finish his punishment at home or return him to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German constantly transferred government money to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest family members and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that German created to fund its campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how we approved the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
He is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's vote of confidence this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly approved the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget heading, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devotes special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that it is not possible to solve so easily by this year of 2008:
The first is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as costs of representatives who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, taxes and credit from banks, often issued, without any meaning, obligations with which they owed disproportionately to their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we only adhere to official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through the same growth phases as the rest of the world, of what ČSSD is bragging.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon they do not change retirement age and pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, in government who governs it will only be a mere bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that politicians who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most retirement tax money and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenditure of the representatives' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the last government hadn't wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who govern to become officials alone, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be received through tenders at the Monetary Marking.
In these tenders the banks underestimate the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another $254 billion will facilitate them by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continuous growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report for customers, from the business consultant Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already spent $66 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions of losses.
"Central banks should really be afraid of what they still expect when they decided to take this step," said ABN economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they were unable to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain fell their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall of interest rates," said the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks will help to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue book, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is used and reality.
"There the debates are barely structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my ideas."
Interested people can now learn about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that the attempts to influence the development of the climate are futile, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions present repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the cost-benefit relationship."
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore failed to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for a change so that officials can spend time with them until the end of the year issuing the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without the valid meat.
According to traffic, the sheep have not changed it mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the peoples they announce a rapid decline in the change of meat, the city offices are full of applications and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers per day.
The queues are expected for half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been taken out of the new meat.
The issue of a new meat lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid meat will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In case of administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, you could receive a fine from that person who doesn't go anywhere.
They could allegedly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, at most.
According to the voice of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, meats issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must slowly change the other types of driving gear.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is some 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a definitive maturity the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the department were going to fall from 14 to 12 years of age.
Against today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by means of revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is primarily awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other proceedings, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 persons in the robbery and today the upper court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were invented cases.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of a criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge concerns criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the household register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found it guilty to Berdych and other defendants.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pęt and Maroš Šulej, who for now have avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change children: 12 million
By changing children in the maternity home, the counsel of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation from the Třebič hospital plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
"We do not approve of such demand, it is too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to come up with an idea of this counter proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterpart sent us to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a recissory value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal said.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň’s family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the expert's report, only it was prepared at Motol University Hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better borne by men although they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women take him worse with the trauma they are experiencing today and with regard to what happens today, Veleva completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Motherhood House of Třebič last year, on 9 December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors you should extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily you can ask the administrator for help.
The court so far recognized them as compensation proportionally low, the amounts calculated according to the tables that count hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the Kingdom brand of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial court in Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka was not presented to the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will resort to it.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," he said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, in the presence of the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and comic comes to everyone.
The same idea has Harabiš as well.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I realized that the project was successful and that that is why I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about directing him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš was able to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic source it resulted in a lucrative business and business activity of which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use its name and sign in passports and even offered its owners discounts to visitors from its farm and attendees to their shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polyvka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that time on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, derived in singer Jarmila Šulaková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court to date.
Something clearly could bring in the dispute, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not wish to disclose any more data or dates.
"We're not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be chosen on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can introduce himself," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices exceeded
I've never really liked Peugeotu too much, actually.
Its walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, exists on the market, and this is much better.
This combo called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just think it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the space of the head in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi bodywork means in this sense, that I will not suffer before two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the design invention though the car already looks pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backups.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi the mentioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Suitcases in case
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the lower back door) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But we're staying at the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic terms it has a capacity of 428 litres, which compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabiana Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is left behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's coachboard its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains pretty flat after dropping the back of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a strength of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would belittle family members five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the then škodas that looked like the exhaust tube was covered by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection on 1400 for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it counts with the equipment accessories in Fabiana and it'll get to a rather similar number.
Now it is only left to decide by which of the two marks.
Slovak students do not participate in English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and for that reason, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bluffs between students have already reached even their parents.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating up a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after a two-year-old attack on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls slapped him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him, he gave us the urge to throw apples and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovaks came here for labour reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, frozen or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island can you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Column called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, with wide avenues running cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of the world of show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the abandoned Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive National Hotel you will be mixed with cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars of the 1950s, so far they still work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating considerably, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments around it as there are.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings as much money as it needs, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by the lovers of the railway.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the narrow sugar factories in steam or electric machines.
Your coachmen for decades haven't been discovered and now they're there, machines that work and whose brothers models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where are you going?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway farm there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on lands of limestone rock.
Mogots, limestone rock pellets and high-scarpated rocks in the falls of the valley, and in its grottos fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the pure habanera factories you can find with your final product.
Perhaps someone might find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was rolled there.
Trinidad
Old island city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was still no road to join the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and for that reason, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places nearby such as Ancón Beach or the sugar factory valley.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Small town in the west end of Cuba, some view it as the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Columbus cross (it is actually a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropical Cabaret, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, all of this could be filled many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see him sometimes.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed are what is influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it was thought, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population that they can only begin economic and security development" told BBC station Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of whom the fourth part is in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's very little," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assistant countries in recent months, there is a controversy as to whether all allies make the most of it in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized by liabilities.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fight demands there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vague.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," wrote Sun in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt amounted to 842.7 billion kroner in September.
This year the government planned to lend $159,200 million.
However, in early December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million kroner thanks to the improvement of the state budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic increased by the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months this year it increased by 40,200 million kroner.
Since June, however, it has declined 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Economics has confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
For the whole last year, the State was indebted to more than 111 million kroner.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should be moved between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, also sees it: "We could pass the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we do not yet know.
If it was seen that the situation on the political scene was changing and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and comes, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
Internal indebtedness of the state grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
External debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.300 million kroner.
The so-called debt of the negotiable state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average government debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly of the obligations where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of state debt payments and management for the year 2007, it is learned that the government planned this year to lend 159,200 million krona.
In early December, the Ministry decreased the plan by 152,800 million kroner thanks to improved state budget developments.
The amount consists, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million krona instead of the expected 91.300 million krona deficit.
The rest consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech consolidation agency with about 13.3 billion krona, the reserve of 10 billion krona for pension payments, 43 billion krona for financing state bonds and 1.8 billion krona in payments of European investment bank loans.
He compared today in front of a court in Jartúm for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British professor who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam had been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm 15 days in prison and to expulsion, his lawyer indicated.
The British was accused of having let students from 6 to 7 years old give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was subject to a beating penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School in Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and with sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
" Eight names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed " , says the principal of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children in every 23 have chosen Mohamed as their favorite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear picture with the following legend " My name is Mohamed ".
The bear himself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that I asked children to vote for a name " is only an " innocent mistake " he said.
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speak of religion in class " .
Let's remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name most often given in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " evident tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90 per cent Albanian province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was responsible for a new mediation by the UN last August.
The US and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo by the Security Council, are insisting on the pursuit of negotiations beyond this high date.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve for her.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these "last opportunity negotiations" took place on Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given some of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Effect dominated "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered, for his part, that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade particularly fears a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belonged exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament shall have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush starts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of his own international peace conference on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed immediately to enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year old contentious issue between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties ' obligations to the peace route they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main dangerous problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things”.
Going back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what future negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush established at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of his " vision of two " Palestinian and Israeli States " that co-exist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard on behalf of Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , believes Prince Saud in his periodic Arab interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in this type of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (PGN), a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
" He was not in intervention but in patrol, and was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, circulated " to all gases " .
" He hit the police car on the left side, after a break of the early step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcoholemia on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front part collapsed, windshielded windshield, bumped bumps) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " facts of involuntary murder and denial of help " to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the police version, namely that this mini-tocycle arrived relatively quickly to its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the friction of the socks on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed the time for the police car to come to a halt.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just then?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious fault " with regard to this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which to be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that gives precisely the scene.
"We went down next, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, this witness reports.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a fully frightened policeman, who was spitting.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the assurance that the people were present from the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescue arrived " about 20 minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor underlined.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken in the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been called in.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been called in.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement took on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of urgency and the wastes to which they swore before Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days about the legality of re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" All we have attended is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court ' s judgments " , Judge The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president " no longer " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared on Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
His military uniform was expected to be abandoned by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term of office.
The Assistant Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of the pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still show a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
However, the liberalisation of contraception allowed for a better "dominance of fertility " according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 is from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births in every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
More than seven hours of space work would have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuceeded" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Discovery module, a thick cylindrical piece to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing sink for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After being displaced, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a size of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which deploys as accordions, has been damaged in just about a meter by a cable that crashed.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had an exit from the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to caracolore at the end of 30 meters in length of the remote-directed arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (walker of space) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "Operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he cut the wire and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed close to the air slave and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulation to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapuceeded" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the launch Discovery for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group has announced that it has to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays in the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which provides for the opening flight of the aircraft.
The cost of clearing the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus " , announced the home of the European EADS builder.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads related to the delays of another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the voters today with a televised message about public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, content with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, no incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a pressure-stricken campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is " never had such a dirty election until the time of Eltsin " .
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, former champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits according to his lawyer are prohibited.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two questions that are much more open:
Who will happen to Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to become known.
Selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, legislative elections as well as presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo, they do not feel owned by their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the state university of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist State, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic upheaval " , estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " give up personal responsibility on their own " , which they had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What do you reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
Nor on behalf of the Russians will they vote for extremists.
Conclusion by Tamara Techerednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: " What do you want to reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are at liberty.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his right-wing.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has ended, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
Records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Universität Technische in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now around EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th European Union trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will do a lot of both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans " , Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually to " 47 billion euros of goods " and " 10 billion euros of services " , said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential." The European Union and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Duraro Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current turn of credit concerns, and announced an offer of £10 billion at the basic index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , a communiqué indicates.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market so on 6 December at 1215 GMT, at the base index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the rates " of interbank loans per day in line with its basic index.
The interbank rate per day was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was established at 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important rate of penalty which had discouraged banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the euro exchange rate, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny consideration of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a decade of action taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50 per cent increase in surplus for employment, the restoration of TIPP (internal rate for oil products) floating, a cheque-transport or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting has been raised at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between a majority and a few hours' opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
PS Chief Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Melvin Benn British producer's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less or the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Melvin Benn Republic Festival, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Referring to Glastonbury as a " more inspiring event " which he has never seen, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are stagnant in low-class policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones is pursuing.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that recently took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park of Chicago, after having disembarked in the landscape of festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are done in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a peasant festival impression in the European and urban way to the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms "that they are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", like that of 80 000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His colleagues from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the role of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions " .
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is begun.
All festivals in the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them courage and ensure that the directors hold interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in the wallet at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock exchange? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks away from closing the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock market tends to have a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties are blind in markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking place in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both the long and short sections."
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, not free of volatility "mostly because the impact of the likely decrease in Fed types is not known, given the high level of crudeness and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI sales manager in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"It's not the thing for much joy," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,940.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert makes it clear that things will be something different this year because he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Investis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year is about the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Investis Banco, ensures that the rise will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times in December has been a month bassist.
The real year-end rally lived in 2003, in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bubbling of technology.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent rebound.
You will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the moment Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if you can count on your year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew much of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the People Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to jump to the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of popular experience will be crucial for other entities to focus on this initiative that follows trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that is being pursued by the people with the project.
To capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and trades of the chosen streets to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with more bright colours.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a major investment, although more staff recruitment, since there are only about six employees per site to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
Currently, there are 2,500 branches throughout the world.
And 60 others who operate under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these popularMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco first doubles the stock in Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With that sentence yesterday, he expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain he was directing doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Just one aspect haunted his joy: 'It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telefive ended yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain places its loss on what we've been in the year at 15.66 per cent.
The value in Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who gave up 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Five Days Editor) and 1,779 million Vocent.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telefive announced last week that he plans to become the first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespana, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this data had been announced, the television channel would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing over the year 2006 of 965.4 million.
For its part, the net billing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has so far maintained: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those we have already valued with 33% Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing at the moment of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is explained that the projected growth in income has been cut from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the expected earnings of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: It recommends buying both values based mainly on its high profitability by dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Madrid Box: Sees better Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintener) for the 'multiple attractive' and raises the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends infra-weighting in both cases when having 'similar threats' (satisfied market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress voting on amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the rules of procedure for the development of the new law, with the aim of both to come into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that markets operate efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, requires the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join value companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of financial instrument operations, so that regulated secondary markets are complemented by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, to facilitate NCMV monitoring.
In its passage by the Committee on the Economy of Congress, several amendments were incorporated, including the fact that the debt securities are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the debt of high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that may be performed by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the adoption of the Royal Decree defining the professional functions reserved for economists in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer collection services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be released on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise of the CPI in November is a "temporaneous figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He has also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged regarding the advance data today.
Virgin plans to collect with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to £12 billion (16.800 million) since they entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he was amassing records of over £25 billion, a figure that had gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of one hundred per cent of that money offered by the Government and which would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to pick up around a quarter of the British bank income that is deposited in the next three years to get that remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The Richard Branson Mogul Group, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Detained the mayor of Totana by alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has detained today at the first hour of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then director of the municipality, and who according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and urban councillors and no further detentions are being ruled out within the next few hours.
In addition, the counsel of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot released at the beginning of this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by the SER Chain, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, therefore outside, was stopped leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy by Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in the press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bono itself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes" the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who announced on 15 November his decision not to appear in the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change at university level.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He has also pointed out that, as citizens know who the economic vice-president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more seem to the citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak quietly and quietly is the Congress, the government president on one occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "good work" and has not wanted to see him already taking up his position so as not to fall into what he has indicated, his opponents might view as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unconditional persecution both to the skeptics of their predictions and to those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach compels you to explain why your Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading the EU into non-Kyoto compliance.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has occurred, and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it calls on the Spanish to make it clear as to what measures they will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been or will be such explanations.
It is precisely because it is about sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the amount of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he hurriedly denied it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands nor demands, but adorns the myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we travel by bike or cool with the fan.
Arrested by the Mayor and Chief of Local Police of Totana for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city secretary and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have reported sources of the investigation today.
The building was arrested in its home and has been transferred to the Consistorium, in which the units are currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also visited the City Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests add to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judgement No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought to justice today.
According to sources, the former director of Totana and today autonomic parliamentary of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, who owns a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been accused, as has the former director's current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Immunuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven records, most of them in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the vigues parks of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; Recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provided us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way at the head of the PISA report on the education level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, on the same day that the criticism of the Blackburn book appeared, curiously:
"The content of the signing of Philosophy has fallen to the public as a result of the tragedy of the school in Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor's student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser on Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Discharge Crimes:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal from the store disks of less than EUR 400, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to EUR 1,000, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the discharge imposed (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous kidney has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is leaving hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor gave me one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if the others receive less'.
That is, the feelings that the monthly pay of the workers depends on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been conducted through magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if both were right to receive the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was higher.
I don't know if it required so much science this conclusion.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Court, located in The Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a sour taste, because the main responsible for the massacre of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain free.
His names are on that list of which takes his title the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla list' (2006, not released in Spain) who, at the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the fence.
What's in it for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible losses, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, meat age, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First, we have to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is made in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in return for being liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, sheep's age, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that more likely to suffer an accident, more quota to pay.
That is why both over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics show that they have a lower rate of sinisterness due to their prudence.
Also, by handing out the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percance.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured person, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the old age of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well insured is insurance at all risk, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk with frankness, so that they get coverage from insurance at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer brings will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, even if not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid claims to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that base rate.
"The subsidies and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can be allowed to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old line, drivers have it easier to hire insurance, since the rate of sinisterness is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most advisable thing is to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Usually young people cannot make use of the previously acquired experience when using an accident, and even driving time," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice fear' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, provided that their economic situation permits it, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of sinisterness, so the charges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with frankness (may be EUR 300), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
Insurance for retired persons is recommended at all risk with franchise (with 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when a high level of bonus is available.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible losses, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic is looking for a point worth the eighths in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the liguilla of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve them to be first and the Scots to condemn their classification.
The Italians add up to ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but it still needs another one to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that it receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete with the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on 13 in semifinals in search of a square for the end of the 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would first and ensure a better crossing in eighths.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but it cannot be trusted because on equal nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the Scots bitter at night, who trust to get in eights for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rosoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the triumph, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into eighths and to follow in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being last and without any options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since their dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright."
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The rendezvous and the world tour coincides with the release of a new album that includes its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage with a pair of bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowd that ransacked GM Place, although Victoria’s nerves had been banned days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "did not see our costume, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose exit from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quinteto two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon his arrival at the airport, an army of nanny was waiting for them.
Of the five there are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will be in California, USA, San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears of gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia is affected.
The majority of Russia's gas exported to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute before last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolistic owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will pay more to Ukraine, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukraine's Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told the news agency Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it is still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries from Central Asia.
NHS "must prove foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control criminal records of employees from outside Europe, said a vigilante.
The general auditor's recommendation Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it counts with.
However, its report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the amount of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the doors of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey for video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the Auditor General recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
BMA Scotland's president, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of whom are doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number can be higher, partly because boards have problems identifying what employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely carried out.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was of great interest that this work would be carried out following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in updating the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in movie awards
Control, the biographical film about the late singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named the best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - that has soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree by U2, awarded with two awards- the best director and the best debuting director.
Rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a leader of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris prize for his contribution to British cinema.
The 1950s, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, are currently filming the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, thus named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed attack of Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement by the Saudi Minister of Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile-launching expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
22 other detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active to stop Saudis who travel to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight allied forces and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunis.
Al-Qaeda militants are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as their goal the residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, since five months of work," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesperson on State television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing financial support and support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin on Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for one year, offer an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, Oxford University Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when there are two similar planets.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as the Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police commissioned "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which common voters and currents record video questions and send them to broadcast among candidates.
None of the questions put on Wednesday afternoon 28 November were more ridiculous than the snow monkey that asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican Party in the face of next year's elections.
It is not exactly known how the CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspiring.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single subject, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas that they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchange of words of the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the subject of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with fear of the toxic toys of China and other external concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's latest survey, thanks to its long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincidentally with the fund-raising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his warm statements of Wednesday's debate.
They both came from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early party and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucks.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Party of over 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister escaped calling for an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing wit, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative chapuza.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People do not believe them as politicians, but usually suspend their unbelief when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time, that suspension is much more: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and not focused.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as a Chancellor of the Era.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blairish's countertimes - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died or been defrauded directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his donations to gifts of charity, said he did not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but he doesn't make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, chief fundraiser who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he dilutes himself in making decisions on a family matter, an inquiry commission on the matter - conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Committee on Rules in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard cooperative work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probity and a solid competition.
Card sharks
The Crisis of Subprime Mortgages Is the American Credit Card Market Infecting?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country market for credit cards.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprime infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days' delay, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million jobs in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morocity and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
Deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy requests, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of delay) would be growing again, or the conditions for lenders may have been worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for the year 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are dying.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrower’s lending capacity.
They can even work to benefit the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortising the mortgage decrease if the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
This in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retaliatory.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a contraction of credit push America to recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were held accountable for their frauds with the former head of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were convicted on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were tried in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted of fraud collusion.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group in the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the end of a leaked investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, charges against bankers were that they had warned Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interest of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew it would value it in high.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received close to 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal Louisiana prison.
Kopper is serving a three-and-a-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business failings seem successful.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive chief Jeffrey Skilling were charged with crimes last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract new Russians stocked to all kinds of products, from crafted kaoba yachts to packed car grills of diamonds, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche on the stand next to hiss."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Provided with fuel from the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was in apog.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for the Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thanks.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London's jeweller.
She attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in late suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who re-eleated off the design suit he used as a network carpet veteran disshing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pens, Mövenpick ice creams, tables for swimming pools, apartments in Dubai and Teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44,57).
"Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of the Dutch royal Delft porcelain, in front of a mural-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that Russians with the richest career (10 to 15 years old, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a commercial fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, millionaires of millionaires or tourists, fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton lined with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, salesman for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche, for $17,000,000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car grills in the form of chain bracelets, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted rays of Swarovski-coloured crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive over those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, next to 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price wave of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire already, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone cabins (British style) filled with stacks of fake bills of one million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or paying a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
Chapuza surgery could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance climbed through White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance rise," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor that day on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41 years old, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the researchers are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that has acquitted the top ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been a assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Drink Control Commission, and he left two children aged 14 and 11, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On November 21st they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say if Mrs Castro had been interrogated by the authorities.
The researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered to the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marchito rosel is located on the front of the house, and a stone dagger on the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang hooks side by side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch over him or him," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the fees to lift the Stock Exchange
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down the credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock exchanges were opened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, Ben Bernanke's number two, President of the Reserve, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuing tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the US economy, such as sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total labour force, in an overall cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in US subprime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to the closure of 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to close to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to Britain's first-order companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 of France was above 2.3%.
Earlier, there was a resurgence of market debt tension after a strong demand in a three-month auction of the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, tensioned the credit and three-month loan rates "Libor" between the British banks, meant the largest increase since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England judges the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill up offers to become a national selector, and if not, part time.
The one who does not get the sixth place beating will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, as trials are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubebby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player one day.
But capturing the eye of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who would certainly play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared himself for "fit and bowls" as wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara games in Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did well in the first ones, with 5 lucky and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion today at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of them.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early debut test of the 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class in front of only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent precedents against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias at the trial in Lords, his house as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of elan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex’s team has the joy of living in swords.
He's stuck for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he threw his vehicle at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to say excitedly, "Do you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it's including his ragged pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as suggested by the tea leaves, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, evicting the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus on an official government convoy made up of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he states, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an Allied U.S. force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many said they were attracted by increasing calm in the capital since U.S. troops backed "concerned citizens" groups, armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighbours.
But many declared that they had returned because of the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who set fire to my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will cause sectarian tensions to emerge again and the struggle begins.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlanders lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fifth time to a non-Sarlander who we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves of the smallest federal state for his fiftieth year.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of Sarre that in a study of the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" held fifth place.
Thus, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bachelor's degree.
"The system of vocational education is being used in Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Economy Institute (IW).
More than every five young people make their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very broad.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering science specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying as soon as possible the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this project has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of arrears in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages to the taste of sarlanders, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the Sarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another time shift different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the schedule change in the South American country delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is currently becoming a comic in Spain.
As reported in the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time drain that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by saying that the United States imposed its obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
Furthermore, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia due to the action with hostages.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country have to decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it involved the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision that Uribe made offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk in Spain about Chávez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This sentence was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower actual salary account than the previous year in 2007.
"The blame for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the spread of food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance may also be on employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over one year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking the Federal State for credits and subsidies, according to a German Social Democratic Party politician.
Tuesday it was made public that the rate of inflation with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, prices are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most like planet on Earth, something that has not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and somolins in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, the researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays stop at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, tells Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if there was one day there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface reign temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin on Earth, but she's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question why Venus, so much like the Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers, not only underscore Venus' uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," says ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that spins faster.
This phenomenon recalls wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet is also called a star of dawn or evening star orbits around the sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it disodiumed in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus it is the most part of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democrat Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition finish this fight by receiving Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not introduce ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the field of foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of A China's policy.
China also knows that," said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democrat Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and was thus attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to sources of information from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in its official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words demonstrated that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances like those in France will occur.
Battles with the police on the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disturbances will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious disturbances caused by young people in France, Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Partido de la Unión Democratista) feared similar trends in Germany.
"We need to keep in mind that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people are developing in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing fruit."
It's still early to take a seat at the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The young people played a major role in street riots with the police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitation effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the rate of unemployment among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above average.
There must be more vocational training posts.
Kolat emphasizes: "We need to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families" than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
"Youths should be given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with lights overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1000 police are in charge of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On Monday night around 80 police were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far away from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that nothing else has to be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and with little content in the general debate of the Lower House, she does not live in the country that should be governed by it.
With regard to the reproach he had been repeatedly devoted to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptive sentence.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House, it was very clear to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no minimal interest, no feeling of any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was very much praised for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years now the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he strives to express himself so that he can give people a boost.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and concerns about low-wage workers?
All she does is talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how often it is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
Section attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of precincted Republican presidential YouTube and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates are already noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York "a shelter for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with serious complaints: "I want to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani answers to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republicans' group so far has no clear preference, the eight presidential precincts take advantage of the debate at the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second small videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, are not very content either.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler reach power," that was John McCain's reproach on his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraqi troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown himself simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just war in Iraq or debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and refused to raise taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney, who wrote and apologized to the people and the television audience for being a defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when he was asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president took his oath as president.
That is how the eight years of military rule end in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his army chief mandate to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power with an incrusted military coup, the former general first ruled the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the Attorney General of the State, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many supporters of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers died and four others were wounded.
According to information from the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are coming back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restroom, a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written at the best time in the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has its own box, cables and above all its buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What we need to rebel here is the following: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band was rumbled in the minds of people, but it was not something as special as that after 32 years the public missed her so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life work, they could see the surprise faces of German pop artists in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Michael Rother later spent the time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad is one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio was only two years old and in those days it did not have a great effect on the public, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Dusseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Roth followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruins of the 16th century, lived as city refugees.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, a flag of Ottenstein's song association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmony" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on issues of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that has to be thanked Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company set itself as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where harmony appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments with cables are seen.
Deep down there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices that they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is just as it had to be.
Three people who go through the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a tone of music, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
Gender origin was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here screams "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On the stage you think very well about what is already obvious.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderisker Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But they didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the war of Bosnia, was discovered again actor Richard Gere.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the titles of the films have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: at the bottom, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry would not have been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderisker Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Moerderisker Frieden" in a nutshell: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the snipers of Kosovo, one of whom acts very quickly and that also leads to her falling in love with it.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we welcome that the Serbs are not presented again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm was Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was actually never a good film about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about the American reporters in the war who went to detect a criminal war Serb called "zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when they introduce us to Simon Hunt at first, to him who does not simply let himself be a cynic with heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim bosnia that will then kill.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to avenge themselves in a just way.
It is so bad that they wish to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, one deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and points out that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, that hard is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the gender of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are leaky.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or the mining fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bleeding Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short period of time.
They have to go through at least decades until Hollywood runs a good film on the holocaust by using the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was in fact.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you should be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant look at an artist.
When asked him about the parallelisms between his historical novel "Diccionario de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism of the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that it must be realistic to estimate possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, political momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympics would not be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich ' s request for the Winter Olympics in 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which so far we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance."
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut ' s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined," said Günter Ploß, HSB's director on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is inconsistent with the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public sports Federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for 2015 universities not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week did the Sports Federation of higher schools appoint Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) accused the Senate that it did not take such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small neighborhood of Grassbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, German Social Democratic Party (SPD) Members.
While the SPD always demanded an integrated Olympic planning for small Grassbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" on this list are false.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm museum carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stockolmo type", who are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that had soap powder cardboard "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works in the Museum Moderna Museet were hundreds of brilliant cardboard boxes. These did not make them Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce a Brilliant wooden box in Sweden, but were not exposed at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left them to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulten and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and shuffled their pressed silver and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silver. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brilliant list," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" authentication commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "severe accusations" in which they are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had surrendered themselves to a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been stuck in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, had the Thursday trial for having attempted a coup d'état in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations so that he could suddenly be deposited with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who had to watch him had evidently gone into their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are full," Trillanes said.
"We invite people to step into our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite Scout Rangers troops, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday to a great demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been finding reproach on corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that drew attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at coup d'état against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
It's only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options for increasing the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital subscription line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its participation in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains the participation titles for a third partner.
United Internet already on the previous day made almost 10 percent of the company participating in the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch has placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in the capital expansion measure.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained the spokesperson for United Internet.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be content with the participation of ten percent on Freenet and do not use their right, that is, they make 18.49 percent on Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the public limited society Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they agreed that Drillisch was going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
