The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about "taking them by monks"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM in English, for the suggestion that they should change their name by MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate came up with plans to change the name of the assembly by the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid to be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that the new name "comes up with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "bitch" and "pwp" means "cock".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the set of the group "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only one little verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is rendered in a similar way to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on its own members."
The Wales Law of 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which was very supportive of the designation of Parliament in Wales.
Regarding the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of Parliament Wales or WMP, but the option of MWP received most support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, of which the bill on changes is expected to be handed over in a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as AM's disability rules and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when the legislation is debated.
Macedonians join the polls in referendum to change the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is no longer at the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells keep silent while Harlem's churches keep fighting
"The elders to whom I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or another."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As for the churches, fear that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they will return where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of those churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation changed in the 1930s.
A black congregation next to the building was set up.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the stores on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and climbing black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's friars made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the carillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one has taken his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the body that governs the parish and is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "will impact costs" on the board, although the latter had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some friars complained of the diocese's lack of transparency.
A shark hits a boy while fishing lobsters in California
Police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with screaming, when he swam with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only emotional to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "I've been worked!
They've been working on me!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy got here.
"I cried out to everyone who had come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," added Hammel.
The boy was transferred on a helicopter to Rady's infant hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they had divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Point Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the big stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.800 million and continues to grow as fashionable sales and household products fall, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill up the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to reach d 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Besides, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that establishments will look more and more like malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced sales outlets for Argos and Habitat in hundreds of shops, since it bought the two chains two years ago. This has evidently strengthened the sales of edibles and made purchases profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmaceutical income in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale of his pharmacy business made up of 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to fit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old purchasing habits."
Peter Jones "furiously" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of £11 million
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, left "furious" after Holly Willoughby's television host had withdrawn from an 11 million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
37-year-old Presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones sparking off his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at £1.5 million, meant that she had no time to dedicate to the brand of house clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby turned to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was quite different from one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left was startled by all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, because of the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and textiles to the home, and that it could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples were on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presentationer in the ITV I'm to Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on their business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not a president's own" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on the newscaster.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump sees as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have stagnated.
More than three pesos after the summit of June in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, which the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the United States of America to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continues to impose further pressure sanctions.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his mitin speech.
"Things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
They'd have killed millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: ending the missile tests, helping free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump pointing to the crowd who had just ahead.
An earthquake and a tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, assured us that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquake that constantly supports Indonesia, the country is extremely poorly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, it's not usual to find them on the other side.
Even if an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been seconded in Lombok to meet the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and made money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line at the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the draw goal for Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal at minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate with his equipment losing 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left leg before he shot the second stick.
The balloon circled over the area as it moved toward the upper left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Kepa Arrizabalaga that was jumping into the air and entering the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and I didn't think too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard had scored at minute 25.
The front of the Blues passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before he turned near the middle change and ran into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the second pole marking with a left shot that Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
Liverpool meets Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday afternoon in London.
The number of fatal victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and in the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832, according to which the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the rubble of the buildings that came down with the magnitude earthquake 7.5 occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press conference by the agency's spokesman Sutope Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to contact any of us near John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything from the command box camera that comes into contact with us, as they might have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbour of Birkenhead and is found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they are in the process of informing the closest family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that they can't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
Residents just know they can't get back in a few hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman crying on the scene.
He keeps saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information, ask you to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers in phone number 0800 555 111, citing record 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
Their prohibition would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by their fanatic and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "shoot you" and to "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a test of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What's clear is that the 17th-century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A murderous pig crushes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a courtroom in the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put the pigs in a stable on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently she traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjacent court.
He said there was a big male in the courtyard with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and torn apart," declared the cousin, "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police had gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their deaths.
Even though they're not very common, there have already been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos rushed a Welsh farmer against the tractor until he arrived at his wife and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as "destructive."
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to do harm.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong, widespread rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico surpass.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of America for the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, east time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north by Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, he will begin to push tropical humidity toward the north, which will penetrate the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the wave will create abundant and widespread rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, flows of debris and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in punctual areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed character of tropical rain.
We strongly recommend adventure in the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and electric storms will bring local winds uprooted and dust.
The wave will bring local rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flows of smaller debris and narrow roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona at the last hours of Sunday and the first hours of Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness great temperature fluctuations in the US due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to re-appear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country is expected to start in warm October, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates great probability of temperatures higher than the average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw the trial at Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last-minute Friday: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct an investigation into a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh played them while he was drunk and tried to bring his clothes out at a party in high school.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that over 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other strings that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's an audience similar to a football ending or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement indicating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being stabbed by demonstrators while trying to enter an elevator on the way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He kept his eyes low for several minutes while he was being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the entire Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI were investigating the allegations against the nominee the following week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the cover of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect from shooting the lives of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basketball player at LSU (State University of Louisiana).
According to Baton Rouge's police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed that they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliated channel, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the perpetrator of the shot that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was being bailed on for $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge parish forensics office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the runaway unit of the state police of Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police are the neighbours for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local law enforcement for his "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20.
The 2.01 wing was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, declared that the team was "stricken" and "surpassed" by Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The ashes that drop the Popocatepetl volcano came to the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after they had detected crater activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunders and tremors.
The images of social networks showed thin layers of gray in the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
The geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Pro-Independence protesters faced the riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the Catalonian secession.
A group of proseparatists masked by riot police threw eggs and powder painting that created dark dust clouds on the streets that tend to be full of tourists.
There were also subsequent colds that same day with the police, who used the bitches to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independent groups that co-created "Ni oblivion or forgiveness", faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by mild wounds received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independentist region one year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted in a very good way for independence, although participation was low and the opposite of the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop voting at the polling stations throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who came to the independentist demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope of achieving independence.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry out for joy when they can vote, but now we're all set," he said.
In spite of gaining an adjusted victory, though decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan pro-independentist parties fought for maintaining momentum, with many of their leaders most known in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"There's more tension every time," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be presented for election to the European Parliament.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrest a man after a car shot at a house
three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car had fired on several occasions against a Londonderry house.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings declared the grid and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that an object was shot against the car at some point.
The goal of Menga gives Livingston the 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The ascendant Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibonox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive so that Gary Holt's team would rise to a level and put it after the Hibernian, second position.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they're facing the leader, the Hearts, from which they're separated by eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be indicted in division by sixth consecutive party; the main trainer, Holt, still doesn't know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler with me.
Livingston misses opportunities for disabled visitors
Holt's team must have moved ahead long before the moment they scored, for with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross-fire didn't cross the threshold of the gate; then Alan Lithgow's shooting went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a loot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time Rangers dominated the possession but stood up with an impenetrable defense that avoided much work on the Liam Kelly bodyguard.
That pattern went on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop at Kelly.
The Rangers' Warehouse, Allan McGregor took a shot at Scott Pittman's weight, and Litthgow sent the ball out in another ball played at Livingston's stopped.
Many crossings were made in the Livingston area that were continuously dismissed, while two requests for penalty were refused: one by hand and one by one for Halkett's entry to replacement Glenn Middleton.
'Feminal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and outcome for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their ascending path.
His game style and players have only changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is from Holt by the way he pushed the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath throughout the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers missed inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under the orders of Gerrard, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, a whole advance call for Rangers, which is found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many matters, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurdish) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist passed away in a collision where he came around a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street travelled from Deptford, in the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident took place months after another cyclist died in a runaway runoff in Childers Street just over a mile from the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police indicated that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a riot in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance started in Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin around 09:30 hours (summer hours in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A Tornado unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight prisoners are involved in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for slight injuries on their face.
A spokesperson from the prison service said: "The staff of specially trained prisons have been released to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the warden of the penitentiary had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officers had to go to prison to calm down a riot where the staff was attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (places affected by drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that it will happen early next week, when the remaining energy of the pink hurricane runs through the South-West Desert, leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and to arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service reported on a Twitter publication that only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometer Phoenix radio since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that stretched on a 64-kilometre radius of Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service include 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on the edge of the Mogollón in Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Great Conca, could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible isolated totals of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing, for the region is very affected by drought.
Even though floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains can be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the US Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch the ground on the lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, winding up to 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north to 19 kilometers/h.
The storm is running cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that he will touch the ground in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at Monday night.
It could rain a lot in some parts of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall of between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at Arizona's border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will continue to climb through Arizona and enter the south of Utah the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is the heavy precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwestern desert of the United States," reported the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water trumpets and streams of debris in the deserts, and landslides on mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, during the night they were arrested in the Radstock area three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 respectively.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a record on the cell phone of the event.
Trump states that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the scorn and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"Voting by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the scorn and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its process of appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our times with a history of impolite public service," he said addressed the crowds of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the half-term elections.
"They're five weeks short for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't have to, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats' mission is to "oppose and hinder."
It is hoped that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, as CNN told an assistant of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami of Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to rise
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of Palu when waves up to six meters broke into the ground to the luscofusco, leading the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
" Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still on the beach with their activities and did not run away immediately, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesia BNPB disaster mitigation agency on a prison round in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, dragged everything he found," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
They evacuated around 16,700 people to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs disseminated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many shops and destroyed buildings, broken and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, situated at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he declared, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Dojaga and which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and no information" from Dojaka, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," reported the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a shared amateur recording on social networks, you can listen to a man who is on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
Within minutes the water hits the shore by carrying buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important shutdown that caused the cutting of communications across Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
On the way along which World Vision staff traveled to reach the city of Palu, where the employees looked for shelters in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when groups began the unpleasant task of starting assistance in the event of disasters, some complained that they were preventing them from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster on the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, an Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
As soon as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international aid, but it's not yet there yet."
When the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, relatives and friends of the missing were held in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would relieve the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they pulled out a kid from a sink.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandage added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were their students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the broadcast of the news of the overthrow of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival
However, in the messages only one gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
They steal $26,750 while reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a drawer in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole him a money bag he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact the Newport police calling 859-292-3680.
Fox Kanye West changed his name for Ye
Fox Kanye West changed his name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The Being known as Kanye West."
For some time now West, 41, is known for the name Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his assistance with "emotional motives", according to the creator of the program.
Besides being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said that same year while he was talking about his record with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, though this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also got caught up in setting and removing the script and using capital letters.
AMLO undertakes not to use military forces against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, committed not to use the military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he "would never again use the military to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by providing monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities dragged the boys into the criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in I.A.
According to AI investor Kai-Fu Lee, former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
Comments were produced after several parts of the U.S. government had made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it is intended to be number 1 in innovation in AI in 2030.
"Dupplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next great advance in AI," said Lee.
Double funding could double the probability that the next AI achievement would be done in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is director general of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with the highest score and later was run in Microsoft Research by Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the Robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers tend to have to work a lot to get government bags, Lee says.
"China is not the one leading the academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. push their efforts at AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors at AI," he said.
The China State Council published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selected artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2,000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, you currently invest over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence does not record movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and which had blocked applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its neighbours' name represents a complaint from its territory and has denied its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of most of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he won't vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the result will achieve the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum paper was, "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?".
Defenders of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to get admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have today come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of members of parliament said that they would support the outcome of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would need a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The State Elections Committee stated that at 1 p.m. there had been no irregularities.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of name of the country that would pave the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the stores mounted for whom the referendum boycotted.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the service door," added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev states that accession to NATO will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing their vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirming our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required number.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said he'd vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it had gained power in May of the past.
View: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire Brighton defense and ends up marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's defense with Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple to mark the 65th minute goal.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading for the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He took out a defense before he passed several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, which hit Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the network.
"Now he's going through some trouble on the pe," said the coach of the City, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he marked it at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the blue-skys the initial advantage of the Premier League's confrontation.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
I am now getting the ball in the depth of Brighton's field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the gap on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The blues put the ball in the gate before they left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there wasn't many reasons to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer hopes to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies disposal, which bring an advantage game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their title of first division.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why won't I want to compete with that?"
The Nationals haven't announced who the opener will be on Sunday, but apparently they're inclined to have Scherzer throw in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom would your start number 34 have made another session of bullpen on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on your usual day of rest.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 tickets this time.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the electorate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the outcome in the half-term election.
"We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't have to, but I really do, and that's why I'm going on all sides fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and evil.
They don't care who's hurting, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we're never gonna give it to them."
The task of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And they've seen that in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "greedy, valvative, disgusting and liars."
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee, quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm.ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are not well received, and all because of our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he faced anti-Semitism with determination.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, randomly about which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a Labour Member, the meetings of the committee on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when fellows who believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions that I would never agree with, whether in matters of national security or in the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and actually of something like what I say, there's a tremendous fuss and social media attacks censoring center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments to me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist comments every day and don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "untrustful" movement or every change in the rules of selection, the game becomes narrower in its way.
Over the past few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be all right for me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there have been 32 people still in school, led by the neglect of Thatcher's government that literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them, both as a local councilman and as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political stances and I disagree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, all I would tell you is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrosis: A Ayr Invict gets in the way
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there's no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this fine-tuning game of the Lieutenant's Premier League.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invict team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk, that the team took him to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far they've put the test on our parties and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "It must be acknowledged that Ayr took better chances than we did."
The essay at minute 14 Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the party by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climate increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before it, just in the middle of time, turned a shot into solitary, leaving the marker 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott had suffered, which had abandoned the camp to the padiola and, since the reboot, Ayr has advanced further through a stafford McDowall essay, transformed by Climate.
The captain in function of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine trial, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plating Climus when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson marked an essay from the penal line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climate marked, as it did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe gathered the launch into David Armstrong's area and had sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth essay from the local team.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, writing and co-protagonizing with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the own restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the interior Bolivia expects the court to be on its way to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval headquarters covered with apparatus in La Paz.
The public buildings wave a blue flag.
Ship bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Retrieve it is a duty."
In Bolivia without a sea, the reminder of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict continues to live, just as the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their peak in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX sentence on giant screens all over the country in the hope that the Hague Court will take its stand for Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intervening conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has much to do with Monday's sentence.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court will give Bolivia the reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to assist Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that CIX's sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," says Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the present Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile's good will, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would make an unusually quick decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open up a new stage of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong states that his nation will not pursue nuclear disarmament unless he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment occurs at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be about to restart stagnate nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a statement ending the Korean War can double North.
In Washington, he refuses to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump wish for a second summit.
But there's widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit Kim-Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely cover the sun, do not look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that opened the audience with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers drew their most surprising creations on the sidewalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beak hat adorned with a wide glove imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were dried sandals, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, with glasses and tube, and others a melted ice cone.
And if he's a fan of the huge fashion, he's lucky.
The fashionable understanding predicted that giant hats could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bomb, the straw hat with a six-inch bar that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks pulled out at the gateway another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as large as the attached model with a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange flounder bag decorated with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle was the highlight of the 2019 spring collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera on Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope the big hats and beach bags arrive at the shops next summer, for the designer had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The private schools of Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer students and their parents the best level.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that strikes him in the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest rates of approval in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an outstanding one.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained an honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding one.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
At present, languages are having the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language knowledge there is 17% of the reasons why employers are at risk of filling vacancies.
So linguistic skills are increasingly needed to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more work possibilities than they need languages.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a life-per-life skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others go through languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what their children's interests are, private schools always have a number of languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We can't deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages are still of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
We have to do this.
John Edwards is head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron starts with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the sawmills who want to see LeBron James playing with Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Team coach, like Walton, announced that James will play the initial pre-war game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early week training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers' matches.
At this point in my career I don't need pre-war matches to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events arrive in Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaigning matches tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's 5 scheduled matches for next week, including stops in cities similar to Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a suspended confirmation vote for your candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it comes to voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you watch it on the Internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today's Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia via YouTube live stream.
Trump will probably deal with the issue of the trial held this week for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who holds the Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of matches is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impulse.
So these five meetings that Trump will give next week are aimed at "dignifying volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters, a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
The rally tonight, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA Team shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until individual Sunday matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's ant could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging push pendulum is a totally invented sports concept but in what sportsmen really believe, and above all in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I suppose we carry that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in favor and a lot to cheer up about, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth turned out lethal from tea to green and is preaching with the example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game in the 15th, he made a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not yet outside.
"Just concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave fingerprints.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, it confirms them as the rivals to hit on Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to win a victory when you put the sun on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Yet speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of the morning, when he matched Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never near to get out.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to see close by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of ants has also shown that the US Team has the strength to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 on Ryder Cup's last day.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after the fourballs and ants with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the ants, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to earn four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood," after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points out of the four initial games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a naked Woods and the American boyfriend Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in the modes of fourballs and ants and five followed.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's fourballs, reconvened with his partner Henrik Stenson in the ants catching up a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in ants after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team goes back to four points in the individual, although as a current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to draw to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Cora says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased his mistrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, like stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing camps and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the United States," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first."
While Ri resumed known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, since it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first peak between an active American president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive action, and even if they oppose "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that sanctions continue to agitate our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "Wicked President" Trump called Kim "man rocket on a suicide mission."
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened last year with "completely destroying" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in taking steps for disarmament, but said that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for that, and he said, "It's been two years, three or five months anyway."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had moved forward, just a few hours after North Korea had denounced him for making "mafia demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "relative measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to fight the growth of macho culture from studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found out that university students in number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do you only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," The Telegraph commented.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects they are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says, and he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure for students involved in lack of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that you sleep enough and that you have a good quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, marked. Even avoid weight gain, since lack of sleep causes the brain to enter in inannition mode, which makes you constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Even so, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can debalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the goal of Menga overthrows the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team of Ibox intended to record their first home victory since the 4-1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which he left his team at eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and a line up of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that he was drawn.
While the Rangers came down to the sixth position, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have dealt with a head wound after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 Livingston that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his joint organization suffocated its opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have marked in just two minutes when the short passage of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the center camper wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to tie him to the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt they should have pitted a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the old Ibox Warehouse, Liam Kelly, had only trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head ending and with Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston at minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher stuck the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at rest by changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when left-wing made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage at the end of the day, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson made the lookout again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACT... was the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pit of science since then, counter Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and inject it again
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovaries cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various cancer types called HER2 and then reject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of Bethesda's National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "teachers" to addressing cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance in the program Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was arrested in the studio after a confusing presentation he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often speak to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I'd have been out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a satire played by Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on the demands for sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been broadcast, Chris Rock has gone up the images of West's criticism of social media.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had had had a bad time behind bars because of his hat.
"They walked with me in the backyards.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They bullied me!
And then they said I was going to pick," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pee?", saying that I'm going to "put on my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Try with love."
His comments sparked applause at the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The whole study was silent at all."
They had been appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed by an interpretation of song I love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West obtained the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Grateful to FRONT MAFIA"
However, the hostess of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "who he is and that's completely wonderful."
"So and everything, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "or being officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The fox Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to appear before the Court of Magistrates of Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of the HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a male hero, saying that said roles on the screen translate into what seems to be a lot of boys have to be hard to respect.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamen).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculinity characters.
He went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with the boys."
In his interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, claiming that "sufficient horses and battlefields."
As of November, Kit will lead to a replacement of True West by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considered his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this program, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects over 820,000 people in the country, declared the health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in international terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from the Republican Party Senators, "dangerous fellows" and "conspirating theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
Los Angeles Democratic Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators from the "ultraright."
" Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the widespread information included the particular addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the United States government headquarters, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of improper sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information to a Waters staff member, reported Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, has not been responsible in any way for the filtration of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This disgruntled man became angry," wrote Fleischer.
"You understand that you have no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
You mustn't be challenging.
You mustn't question the defendant's motives.
You must remain approachable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, which critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's audience.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who showed up to debank Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it be true" he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement entities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We will make sure we discover the culprits," he continued, "as well as that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again Together (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is now traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new British films and it seems that this can be applied to the return of this parody's franchise and Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the obviously stupid issue that we are at the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent twin-eyed character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comical creation designed for non-anglophone cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his extraphalous claims of adultery glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind that contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, in which he sowed chaos in his footsteps.
There's a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last release.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor steps make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy jumps to the eye, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this type of "serious" films, such as 007 and Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's film jokes change by embodying Bean's character.
Now the permanent topic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent on duty, a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the height for a prime minister who's in conflict, who's already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself to this character who almost looks Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform us that, as all active spies have committed themselves, they must take someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives extra-official lessons about how to become an infiltrated agent; on this side there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take Whitehall back to English for an emergency briefing and meet with their old and suffering fellow Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's secret service return to action, meeting the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is succumbing dangerously to the charm of the multimillion-tech charismatic multi-millionaire claiming he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of ridiculous falcatruces: disguised as waiters, set fire to an ostentent French restaurant; create a tumult that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Back; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of the House of Back.
Of course, all the arrests come out of this last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems to be pulled out of a child's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help thinking: can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but which they cover for five
Supposedly, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend their savings through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country to the workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported the four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, today the Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day workweek doesn't fit into party politics and is not being considered by it."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current water company shareholders will not recover all of their investment, as a Labour government could perform "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on business councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector shares to employees, who embolden annual dividends of up to $500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh took at least a week behind the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, at an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems unmovable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett flatly denied it," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive poster of stars that will act and an equally impressive mission, to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people turn to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of ending poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen at 12 years of age to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuadeing people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism", people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of his followers, pushing a different set of goals.
He claims that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from their shares, of which at least $10 billion was disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that until now guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investment company and executives who have committed themselves to "helping children develop to their maximum potential," with the promise of providing Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered, "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to make a "blocking" to hinder Russia's energy exports, announced the U.S. Interior Secretary
"In case it's necessary," Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government operates, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy in the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called himself the "power consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, bearing in mind that it is in practice the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that he has only one tactic with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas liquefied to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 oil pipeline of $11 billion, which was established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after the meeting with the US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, which took place in September in Moscow.
The US position got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry's leading organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI) called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said he would carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the government fracture and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most Warren's own voters do not believe that it will be presented by 2020.
Fifty percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said the senator would not submit her candidacy, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk's political research center and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported that candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include the former Vice President, Joe Biden, and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide before January, he informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in the background of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"With what my own son is going on, with what's happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the audience at a rally by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was taboo and that his son and other war veterans, "turn around different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what militiamen and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District are challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district submitted a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff's Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) filed in August against federal policy did not reveal itself.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations that face widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assisted in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the so-called prohibition violates that principle," he explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants is damaging to the American economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide labour."
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation gets worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center of the city in Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their dinged belongings, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke their back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then only silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of abusing "propagandistic announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. daily praying for the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, referred to the payment supplement China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what the country's officials coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war as a witness to the leveling of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters of states like Iowa, which supports the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed US workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the United States free press."
"As the Chinese government spread its propaganda, it takes advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and press when it publishes a payment announcement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newspaper post at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese can have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under the strong thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he says that "one of the most important newspapers in China has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what it was.
Kavanaugh's disaster loses the female Republican vote a few days from the half-term election
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various accusations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially for female voters, in the next half-term election.
The reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell school at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that it is doubtful that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm the moods of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsellor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, to the flu of "near November!", manifested themselves in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to continue ahead with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reported Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will surpass any expectation," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It is true that he is already tall,
But it's going to be even more, especially among the indecisive voters of the neighborhoods outside or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This became a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the defendant's bank or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps the Democratic election on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the witness of Ford or Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support it.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the people surveyed completely or probably believe Ford's testimony against 35% that supports Kavanaugh's testimony.
Besides, 38% believes that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of horror when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a college party when she was studying in Yale in the '80s.
The World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced that the intention of hiding Inrupt is "dominating the world."
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, to-dos lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available on a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique because the user has full control over who can access what information.
The company calls this a "personal empowerment through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to its president, John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers from all over the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about introducing or not a complete change that would modify his business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Homage to Bernard Vann, decorated clergyman with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous homage in their hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial monument in his honor at a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with "great courage," he directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without help of anyone, and bringing down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "my honour to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the ball off MMA fans at the best time
Imagine you've been awake all night to enjoy Bellator 206's full show, and when the best part comes, something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, six of which were the main ones, and was broadcasting live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see their faces, the United Kingdom spectators were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours waiting to see the struggle.
One fan described the shift to these childish drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very tasteful."
"State regulations refuse that this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to change to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they will take account of UK spectators in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think of repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday to them.
But we're working on finding a solution.
When the change occurred, I started to receive a lot of messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five struggles, instead of six.
It hurts us a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims that he grew down feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited of the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "less" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children and children."
He said, "Even today, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a leading LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and he wanted to give hope to others.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was quite a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so much in so little time" (when only 14 years of age participated for the first time in the Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I haven't been able to tell you that I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that very moment, at the time of his death, when I realized he wasn't really invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he confirmed.
The choice of Proud song by Heather Small is also not in vain, since it is the melody that accompanied you during your preparation for the Olympics and still puts your hair on your head.

An Mickelson in low shape ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, remained in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and could not participate in the fourballs or in the ants on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times for the United States, the five times champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Even though it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at the age of 48 it does not fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson's meeting in Sunday's ninth match at the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start with good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a slap on his shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk shared.
"I fully trusted myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way it is, and so we think it should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never reached the level of his individual palmarès.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halvs, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides the team with intangibles.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person with genius and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players have spent with him this week.
He's a lot more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in Ryder Cup's last individual journey can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes started in 1997 in a match in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal advantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; as in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won little," Bjorn reflected, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows this hasn't finished yet.
Tomorrow we have to go everywhere.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled with the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you put your abilities as a golfer to the best of your ability.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to have a better individual performance than with their peers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides two extremes of those last-day spins, being part of the team winning Brookline, but ending up as a loser after a European miracle in Medinah."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when he was asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players towards the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We prepare our alignment taking this into account and placing the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship postponed once again
The German Navy's youngest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't reach until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, the local media reported.
The service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It's understood that they'll have a powerful cannon, different antiheroes and anti-ship missiles, as well as hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the newest frigates up to two years outside the original ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be out of date when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after the delivery.
Little did you know of the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "Cricial flaws in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen-class frigates.
Besides, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships Germans used in World War II.
Besides faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached the amazing amount of EUR 31 billion, compared to the initial EUR 22 billion.
The problems of the younger frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to deploy.
The officer claims this problem is getting bigger and bigger, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new research being carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as bats Myotis daubentoni and Plecottus auritus in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An audio analysis performed by experts on all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed picture of the scale of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as glued traps for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind.
but because of his night hunting habits, his ears are more useful than his eyes in hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the state manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historical trees and a beautiful habitat.
But there are a lot of things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling bats before performing maintenance tasks on property, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single child of maternity can kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, and destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still much to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how they go to their populations."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims and his lawyers are getting ready to sue the German publication
Christian Ronaldo calls the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know by his name.
Your lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The head of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's glad the footballman paid the woman $375,000 so she wouldn't say anything about the incident, he published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his publication, 33-year-old Ronaldo, he's been hiding this false news on a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false," he said in front of the camera five times winner of the Golden Balloon.
"People want to get to know each other by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man," added the smiling player.
Ronaldo's lawyers are getting ready to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" by Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the personal rights of recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents presented at Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the supposed incident, kneeled down saying he was 99% a knight, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both had sexual relations agreed on by both sides.
Majorga also claims that she came to the police and that she had photographs of the wounds, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified by reprisals and was worried about public ridicule.
The 34-year-old says she's trying to revoke the deal while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would regret forever losing its position as a world car manufacturer leader after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It is necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, in case Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for manufacturing the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons the EU by the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other United Kingdom car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreeing on the functioning of border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the major concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of supply chain in case an agreement is not reached in Brexit.
The Toyota production line is very well adjusted, and parts of suppliers from the UK and the EU come every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortage of parts.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace for more than a day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely balanced to avoid these border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so to enjoy the current success, but also to make the most of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota couldn't estimate how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term added costs would reduce plant competition and even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston's employee for 24 years and United union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesperson said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be held again
The White House stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and the undersecretary of justice Rosenstein could be delayed for one more week due to the struggle by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy Attorney General's office or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, he's been fueling the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports indicating he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate's judicial committee that testified to Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI on the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, "There's not a date yet fixed, it could be this week, or it could be a week longer, given all that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists questioned that claim, since Sanders has been holding a press conference since September 10.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to an aversion to the grandeur of reporters, although he added that it will not be her who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not quote any source that had endorsed that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than to address the questions to her.
You're witnesses to how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences in solitary are scarce.
Maybe the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm down before Brexit
The Health Secretariat sent a letter to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are scheduled to be reached this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members of the European Union, and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, informed the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he passed out when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen in the band line before they took him in the camilla to carry out a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist at Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total tickets on Saturday before leaving the party, which raised his total of the season to 18th.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help homeless people because of the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May announces that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will be used to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep on the streets.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second houses and purchases for rent, may be up to 3%.
Farm hopes that the change will be able to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of London's new buildings are sold by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a cut in the tax on land transmission to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the large builders of maintaining the prices of high housing through the purchase of soil and the non-use of land, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderate-priced houses to fix the " shame of the housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing-related reforms, including the control of renters and the prohibition of evictions to which the tenant is not responsible.
He also wants to grant the municipalities the greatest powers when building new dwellings.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it's necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
It's not fair, however, that it's just as simple for those people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign-based businesses, to buy housing than for British resident workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity that is not supposed to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's picker at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running a club."
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coach position include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about the success of those figures so consolidated in such a large club after he had previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Will success depend on me at this point if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely that I've only found success here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after an assistant period in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within Hearts' technical staff.
At that time, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from about to go down to win the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever was during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads," he remembered, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn't hurt me, I made a reasonable living and enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure from work, but I like training.
I've always liked to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the complete interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British Summer Time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a look is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA Trade Adviser, in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the football world for longer than expected caused a pattern similar to June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, even though restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The drop of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June has worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results obtained with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specialized in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In pubs and bars controlled consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for leisure and hospitality analysis, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent per annum will be especially painful if this is added to the continuing increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for restoration businesses and the time will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breath for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with joint benefits of more than £9 billion and is considered the reference point of the sector.
One in five children has secret social networks accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A poll conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "False Insta"
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content will be published
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "principal" account available to show their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (referred to Instagram's social photo exchange network).
This news has given rise to the fear that sexual content may be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a "primary" account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked for her to be raped.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's manager, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish federation of athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from their wide international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a lot of desire to be an athlete's spokesman and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and who currently works as a usual BBC commentator, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered from a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only the time could determine if I could recover and until I did.
It was a exhausting job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I am currently doing agile exercises.
Thank you for your messages of encouragement"
An announcement from a breast milk extractor in comparison to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A breast milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an advertisement comparing lactating mothers with cows that are mowing.
To announce the launch of the so-called "first silent portable breast milk extractor in the world," Elvie has published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I move to myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not opening, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on, "Museum, moje, I'm feeding babies, moje, moje, I'm pissing my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 playbacks and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them said that it made manifest the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.

Another viewer commented the following: "Clarically traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't they use it to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even one woman said that the song seemed "very funny."
"It seems to me to be a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Getting my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little shot, but I played it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like cows."
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they have been dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their bras.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who draw their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be quietly fitted into a mother's bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out of there while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and executive creative director, commented: "The Elvie Extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we want to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time that Extractor Elvie holds the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have silently moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained emigrants increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential fathers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that those data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked to support minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are godfathers or who are part of their home are illegally found in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of these to appear in court before the end of a month since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will come through videoconference instead of in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who fail to meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent seizures or escape attempts by the workers of the shelter and reports of the system published over the past few months.
The lawyers claimed that these fears increase in centers of greater dimensions than Tornillo, where there is more chance that the symptoms of a child having a bad time go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good-bye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were illegally found in Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner."
"You must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he informed the assembly.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "out of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were given for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We turn to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war takes place.
The UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion of Idlib has allowed for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would be destined for the Jihadists, including the soldiers from the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The UN envoy Staff of Mixture hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem exposed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, claiming that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Command
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-election by 2020 unless, as many Liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals will put an end to their presidency in an early manner.
In which no doubt it would be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, up to 1.05 million viewers at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million over the past four years according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led cable channels audiences with 3.5 million viewers during the evenings when important news came.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for the designated Survivor ABC, who deals with a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parties: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, he asked.
"He answered, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, Washington's plots can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, if emigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
To disconnect from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, supposes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spends six hours watching a panel of experts debate on the use made by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather bomber jacket ("a cloth full of arrogance," Washington Pos said, and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s s sketchy descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a space that deals with changes in characters and daily argumental turns of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praise to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to lose an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I made contact with Mr. Fleiss this week, he was setting sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He wasn't able to unravel while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate's Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were all doing those crazy shows back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to more to finance the candidatures of the House for the election of half of the legislature
It's no surprise that the 17th congress district in Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congress district with two representatives in career positions to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburg which was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who got his position in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb stands against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania determined in January that the Republicans manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in favor of them.
The election career in the new 17th congress district triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after gaining an adjusted victory at the March special elections for the 18th Congress District in Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalizing O Salvador for its support to China and then went back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners launched the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to order the heads of the US diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "to decide on recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the department in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador was fought, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The sanctions proposed, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent the emigration of people into the United States.
But in mid-September, important government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for O Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given to him by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal deliberations always and when participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, of which there are currently abundant evidence in the public file.
According to the record, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must render accounts in that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They're many unknowns and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to hit Hitler if the western front resisted and supported Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The course of history revolves around those turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerating or is behind it.
Americans are facing a number of these inflection points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck since this paper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapable of the charge.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that The Times' information is not true.
"How shall we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the half-legislative elections for a Congress that demands responsibility for Mr. Trump?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was aware of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans' player is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this month, would place them in a very favourable position to rank in the G group of Europe League.
An injury on the knee prevented Central Camper Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as the Villarreal is a good team," declared the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the party thinking we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were higher.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes made on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team's good, the boys are having a good time, and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget last season and be successful."
Women worry about saving money for their retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents were clear how they wanted to be taken care of, few people spoke to their family about it.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their couples on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want you to care for a relative, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Department.
You can start with the next one.
You can't prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don't express your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to receive care, since these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the financing options for extended care are a policy of traditional extended care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy of cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever money is available.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes if you're unable to communicate.
You also appreciate the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're disabled.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your parent has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care about it?" asked Martin.
"What drugs are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
It establishes a plan."
A man gets several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place about 2:30 a.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the aggressor.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the cut-off of communications, rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the Dojaga Regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees of magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provide you with some key data about Palu and Dojaka on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Célebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dojaka is a regency that is located along more than 300 km of coast northwest of the island of Célebes.
This region, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Célebes, especially in the coastal region of Dojaka.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Dojaka were hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donjaka.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dojaka in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific High-Activity Firebelt, so it regularly suffers from earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude hit south of Xava, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, leading to the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude took place near the city of Mandala, the capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Regency of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami mortals.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died because of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists shot temporarily.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a domestic violence crime, of preventing a complaint of domestic violence and of resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 loan, according to KTUU.
He presented himself before the trial on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course," when he was asked, he informed the prison.
Palin is facing three minor offences of type A, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court for war veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His bride had accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
There are at least 384 deaths after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Célebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the dead balance is expected to increase with the passing of days.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Central Célebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They broadcast videos through the social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the town of Palu beach when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are trying to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, following the lives of the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious "intentionally" injuries to them, according to the notification of the intention of a death penalty application filed in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury filed with Saipov a charge of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by the prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "markable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors declared in describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego's family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent of accusation.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York hasn't tried a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted by conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he inspired the ISIS videos that he displayed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was found not guilty of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal agents responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence guilt statement without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A parliamentary tory states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a "people's army" today during a protest at the tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
ordinary Member Peter Bone said before the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would 'have already left' the EU if Mr Farage were the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her party's divided ranks was evidenced by joining the Tories to remain in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain the commitments of his Czech plan between the attacks of the supporters of Brexit, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave of Solihull movement that he wanted to put an end to the Czechs' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have relied on him to assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If you had been given the position, we would already be outside the EU at the moment,” he said.
The Member of Parliament of Wellingborough added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Czechers' plan.
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the Tories and supporters of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also came to the march, since he told the reporters: "All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Czechers' plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the check plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and we're meeting here today to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, if it's uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group's start-up this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit bo's concept doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider her candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a Western Massachusetts locality.
Warren, frequently criticised by President Donald Trump, will be presenting himself to the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its electors using the council format since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that we need a woman at the presidency."
A detention related to the death shot by Sims, the LSU player was performed
Baton Rouge police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson on a press conference held at 11:00 (Eastern time).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was going out on the images.
Yess, 20 years old, was shot near the campus of Southern University in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde interfered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-metre-young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reaches the world title thanks to team orders, which enabled him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas ranked himself before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who had set off from the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into boxes first and let Hamilton run traffic on the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in boxes one time later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to become reluctantly free of the inside at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went up to the seventh square at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led the race during a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to get faster at the end and forward Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth position.
He finally went into boxing around 44 but couldn't move forward any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he had not filtered Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "mersible, repugnant and liar".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate, when you see indignation, when you see people who are angry and miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't go."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you done any filtration?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No,” he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration had come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the committee, as reported in The Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep his confidence and did what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to suit the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night's event: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who they hurt, they have to run down to regain power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants achieved an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the local set before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat at the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to get back to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time meeting between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a hectic initial period, Sullivan re-joined the local team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the draw goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advance on the marker before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard tied the match back with a goal with power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined each other to help Nielsen advance the Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the victory through the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next party, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an aircraft can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to make sure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The dead people's balance is 800 and there are many missing people after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Générale refused to leave his post in the control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu that weighed violently.
He stood at his post to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the exit at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart is broken when we are told," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Dojaka, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokeswoman of the agency.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
A drinking water shortage.
People are looting the minimarkets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and informed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN informed.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
plane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there's one missing after an airplane accident in a pond
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there's one missing after stating previously that the 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that she was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has gone from a long way to the landing strip.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in with very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to advance through the water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working close to the site in the work of improving a pier also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to aviation safety network data, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
An analyst makes up the night's chronology when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution passed the tests on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the motions of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his previous statements as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers for as long as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went upstairs on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was " lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that once after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"I bore her of her life," said Hale.
It's scheduled for the defense to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held for trial by the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception the genre has by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to become popular.
Artists like The Fleets and Commons recently experienced a surge in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York Child Caregiver demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York babysitter is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from the mother in whom she complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish when she discovered that the baby-caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs Maurice twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caretaker who had just left, who was afro-American, had done her job badly and was waiting for a Filipino according to the announcement of the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid the day of work and sent home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and requires a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even if there was no contract by means.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," said the Post on Friday, to add later, "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable, for they were afraid they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife had sent him a message that I had no intention of sending him.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it had been due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!
After comparing the demand to "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you going for such a person?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as you can conclude in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a chamber for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being refused, he added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was "agrid" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to which he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it.
I think I felt the success of Paddington a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye over the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked successfully to save his life.
"No one regularly called to say that he was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had already died a while before and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperese, in that moment of mourning for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the Calvary she was suffering.
"No one has detected it," he said.
"He had his head down and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Postponed women's postcards to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are wearing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel myself every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room."
However, he left work before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, "I'm still concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't comment on me that he was sad or depressed or anything like it," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The day of Christmas he played deep (when the children opened their gifts, he made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He said that his death meant a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He has torn the family apart.
They beat us up.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), we might be able to get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that I was afraid the committee would be "throwing up" because of the paralyzing of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to do the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
There are five weeks left for the half-legislature election (6 November). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be chosen for the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI conducts its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea drops under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said 1,127 desertions occurred last year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by the people responsible for passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
The vast majority of the deserters in the North finally offered them the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the biggest stretch of border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters illegal migrants instead of refugees and often return them compulsory.
The relationship between the north and the south (which technically continues to be at war) has greatly improved over the past few months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were being parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there's no possibility of one-sided disarmament first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered against the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and asserts that it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and assured him that it was inappropriate for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call it hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasions almost screaming and getting talking while he had described his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee, cataloging the charges against him as a "murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by Liberals angry at the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudiced the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
He objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the position and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are currently," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection for the patient and care of accessible health or the Roe vs. Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not question whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to access the court and still expect us to say, look how good!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diatric, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't throw it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, do I?"
He went on to say, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was a executive somewhere, who said that she was crying too when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that consisted of that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he kept going.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible rage to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of her neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and drove me to the hollow of the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidatures.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken on an adventure outside of marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said to me in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fund-raising, so it swore it wouldn't run for the presidency unless it was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" she asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (thankful to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates and angry with existing sexism) who remained speechless.
"You would think he had suffered a nervous crisis," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my stone?
"Did you choose?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombing of the trade war between the United States and China was devastating and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a gap between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming from the United States from China.
Beijing countered in the same way, the most recent rising rates from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but doubling publicly to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its letters correctly, the pressures of the US trade war could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "listed" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the necessary conditions are now given for the voluntary return of the refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or countries to support the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team for a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most combat he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in par 3 hole, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shone on all his series, becoming one of the only four players who got a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The first ranking in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English Ian Poulter, which may have played his last Ryder Cup.
One veteran with eight Ryder Cups disputed, the Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for picking me up and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the glass back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his fellow countryman John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of the Tiger Woods golf for 2&1 in the individual Sunday game.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today that I could have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a golf course of high caliber throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States declared after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fought.
I take off my hat to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to take off your hat.
They were superior."
