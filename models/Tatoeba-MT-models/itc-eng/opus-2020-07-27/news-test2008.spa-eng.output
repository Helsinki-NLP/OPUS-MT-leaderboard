European inflation has shifted in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the vertigious growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the EU Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely to give a 3 percent - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "there is a need to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, struck the record twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation occurred in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat contributions increased by 88 per cent and soya contributions have reached the highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching as early as last month the black gold almost 100 dollars the barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 percent current to 2.5 percent, instead by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months about 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Democratic Youth Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seats: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Safe voters have one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is affected by the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth of the population expects an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government rather than his duties, had failed.
13 percent of the consultants trust or rely much on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population do not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the riots of October last year 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (by 33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question about participation responded that it would surely participate and another 20 per cent said it was likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "general elections to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would participate, and 15 percent would probably believe their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
Some 74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study rights, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of the hospital care.
If we observed these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
The average price increase was maintained by 16 percent of the market hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that this year has not increased VAT.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased on average 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trade triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the one thousand HUFs.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "dispared" so there was no dramatic increase in the rate of growth compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the 9,000 HUF, today they cannot do so even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast, cloud and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket to the cheapest basket this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year, the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during last year's Christmas in prices there was an increase in VAT.
This process was precisely the one that destroyed trade, the supermarkets visibly were unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose a significant benefit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher than the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of consumer items of first-necessary grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of certain foods of first need, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the egg case.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, just 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, the supply of flour has a stronger position than that of egg, and it is possible to impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all products they buy large quantities, removing preserved foods by pallets.
On the morning of Wednesday, in the three shops there were large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to research institutes because incomes are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing conditions of hygiene in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the department physician-head of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
A infection with MRSA has recently been diagnosed in the trauma department of Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A serious car accident wound was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA and since then no significant surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in her body.
Until December 10 of this year we have registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents - said Karolina Böröcz, department physician- chief of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded, and no information is available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxacillin-resistant.
One third of humans carry in their nose Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, tonsilitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied excessively or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that usually react well to antibiotics become bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and quickly infect in inadequate hospital conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as injuries or septicemia first of all to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to elderly or to persons with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where his presence is not examined.
Antibiotics resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff care for them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients hospitalized are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, however, the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come out in public light when the already visible MRSA infections occur in the patient - said the department chief-doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union strongly commends the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples is even less common in the case of travelling patients or in the primary care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this sense there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA was infected by the transmission of drops and direct contact between individuals, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated for at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately you can also experience - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer such infections are recorded or the infection of the pathogen may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of the infection with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program seems to have success, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholism of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
It may be excluded from the possibility that he was driving drunk or in a bewildered state since then the dismissed commander of the XXII district police, who on Tuesday ran and caused the death of a transjuncture - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney-General's Office, after the expert report on the case has been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary control of alcoholism that had already been found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by folding into Kossuth Street Lajos of the XXII district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, that is, the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always yield the step to double.)
The translucent lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Prosecutor's Office of Investigation in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the investigative prosecutors.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three limit credit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total amount of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for projects to transport and protect the environment, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement of a value of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The loan contract of EUR 150 million is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this target in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the project of innovations and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalises with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will return to the subject which, if necessary or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging fees for maintaining the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, will quickly grow?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia may be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, so it can be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and on ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to install here buy new or renewed buildings at a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old homes in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and it is also important for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
They constitute the second category the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
They constitute the third group of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of buildings significantly outweighs the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the Minister of the Environment and Hydrology of Gábor Fodor, meetings at the expert level will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are discussing the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Discussions on the particular issue between developing and industrialised countries are currently taking place.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach agreement that compared with the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020.
Another important theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are prepared to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on aid for developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes "Piac est Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent to 2020, with respect to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be signed, and is prepared to commit to decreasing by even 30 percent if the other major developed regions in the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within which the 15 EU Member States then committed to reaching 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - notes the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
It is a great deal of what is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is sure that its entry into force would be postponed by after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its latest report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the United Nations that deals with climate change, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emissions reduction would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the average temperature of the earth could not be prevented, which according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These tapes made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general Kandahar operations body, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
It is already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the British Community (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence, they also served to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda almost costs nothing compared to conventional recruiting television spots - the BBC told defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably they have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army is also concerned at the fact that, in addition to the tapes carefully edited and censored, there are also amateur videos in the distributor, such as about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak as much as possible of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battle camps of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with video games of shooting, which can be downloaded for free, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can be put directly instead of the soldiers.
Tomb and Salad Cakes at the Christmas Festival of the Ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with pastry salad and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate your feast with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets - so amuse power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries will be invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad, and a reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million to the holiday environment of the end of the year.
The National Agency for Development (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The party of the MET will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry expected the presence of about 300 fifty.
At the festival the portfolio will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, will also act artists and will draw lots of thunder.
The NAF's ship cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinners.
The rental of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of the Christmas held the dance of Lucía's day on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not collect anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's salutary words, and after dinner there was live dancing music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance was not mandatory to dress or dress at night.
The health, work, and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not wait for his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests who, as the press department will report, will take only coffee and salad cake, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The local government minister, Gordon Bajnai, instead, will simply meet with his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own acting hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget you will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a reception of New Year on 20 January, the Ministry will not hold Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as reported by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions are held every year, begin with a brief speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments reported to [orice].
In the environmental portfolio press department, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering together
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Mondays that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work halt will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 13 hours workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machinery Union will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will take a strike for indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda for Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only public health law may be voted on at very early evenings, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways it will no longer work for indefinite time, in the morning it may be that part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban transport of bus companies Volán.
At the same time, there will be a closure of half of the roads in many parts of the country.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Railway Workers' Union (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, but as the Christmas parties approached, they were more and more people travelling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest airports from 7 to 9 am, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educational Unions called a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSS) who are part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, will hold a two-hour strike of warning.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal for public health reform and puts a new conception into a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions which will enter into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions, the possibility that occupations that deserve it may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1: In the country the risk of the Hungarian Guard is increased
According to the Division for Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of the Capital Policy, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the worsening ethnic tensions existing between the Roma and non-Jitan population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes can occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They affirmed that this is due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life handed over the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsys and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "it significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006 there has been increased publicity and momentum for the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 there have been many organizations in the country that define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they are self-defining as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defence, public order defense), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - they add.
They said: this is all done in accordance with the method which attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
It is not only to avoid the legal problems of legal registration but also to highlight civil society and the form of partnership in the case of such associations.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his view, in the last 17 years there were "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Georgian organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital.
The Research Director of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász to the news agency's question stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning on risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - reorganizes the working days.
Not even in the EU or North America are parties unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
Let us also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the last one above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May, the feast of work, on 1 and 2 November, we remind our dead relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country they are two-day parties the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so often one bridge is made when there is only one working day before or after the party.
In exchange for extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of work who regulates in his specific decree when one has to work exactly in return for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not mandatory, on the other hand, for companies and service institutions which, because of their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year's work order can be changed only around the end of the year's parties: from December 24, life is practically stopped in the country, since according to the experiences, most people "punish" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will match mid-week or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be changed around the work party so that later, for four successive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that on Friday, May 2nd will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the party on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming during the end of the year will be able to rest, since from 24 December will not work in almost any place, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissuades to bitter your colleagues' lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that go unnoticed: they are all part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small inconveniences or to avoid consciously confusing situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they've been looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to an appointment?
At best you feel it and try to fix the matter, you might want to call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least usual solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before we proceed to sound explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can water your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than taking a document, an office tool or your phone and not finding it.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but for this morning she disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost at the table of one of your colleagues?
You don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they're going to be mad at you for withholding their things.
Do not grab envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted before time.
You're gossiping about your colleagues' privacy?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and who?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Enter into yourself what you have heard and do not complain about your colleague in his absence, even though others know the things about him.
You're getting sick leave unwarranted?
When you phone the office and say that you're sick and you're unbearably hurt your head, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your work, your impossible tasks, your work at last.
Don't bother your partner!
If you know in advance that you're not going to the office the next day or something can happen to you, so you have to stay at home, comms, so that your colleagues or boss don't have to deal with you the next day.
Tarreos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but you get rid of him with the laughs of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them above their heads), Patals, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Do not allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or to the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Are you feeling too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable living room for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Do not be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
Lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual jam in the morning.
It sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones adds the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the Wings of Love song in Zagar.
National music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks completely different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although again it is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are new features under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi as a whole until he started his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists in the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to win, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew that at first it was only in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national discs, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of also selling in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they are pleased with this label.
The set reacted the way it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The new album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It's good the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the disc in the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The record includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station took the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audiences for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, irrespective of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
There not only the 15 and 20-year-olds attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather feels in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with his.
Instead, we work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi music, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another way.
hvg.hu: On the success list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't intend to make big hits and sell with these successes our record.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a chorus in the Gothic style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists in good voice from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - i.e. Sena, Kutzora Edina, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make up the song or the girls exactly like that changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the song.
That night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the concert and on the disc looks like girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief), they don't have their own role, they sing together and not more strongly than the music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply due to technical problems.
On the other hand, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also covers it, about which we forget for a while our ego, who from where he came and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love rise us.
I would have wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you devote more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to none, but in the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything went to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "solved" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A bag runner traitor risks billions because of its inferiority complex
Disloyal slanderer.
This is what your former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good abilities.
He introduced a long time ago, unlike all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" he let himself be heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what is evident from Kerviel's responses according to what French media translate, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, it won during the American crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity already came in early this year.
In February, some news about the so-called subprime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had payments problems and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and he betted correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded €1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had forged the records in such a way that his discovery would not be reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk has become beneficial
Was he afraid he'd come to find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position, we had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, right after he finished studying in Lyon.
Its annual salary was handled in the amount of $51,000.
Two years later he was already Bolsa runner assistant and in 2005 he became a scholarship runner with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others did.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But soon after my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing a 500 million euro title down.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you go.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they suspected it.
"While he made money, his eyes were closed."
Only then came the coup early this year.
In one day it lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros because of it.
And how did they get him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor that has no vacation is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to earn 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic could obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes will result in approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be devoted to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly introduced countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the ex-President of Nicaragua, decreeed the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal decreed a 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 to $100 billion (approx. 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency that, then the head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in between.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez will rely more on prison officials if they let German finish his punishment at home or return him to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German constantly passed government money on to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest family members and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign at the 2001 elections.
That's how we approved the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly adopted the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but in it the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition is hidden.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than just numbers.
The State budgets of the last Governments of the Social Democrats have suffered from three shortcomings that it is not possible to solve so easily by this year of 2008:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of representatives who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that were passed before last year's elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit in the State budget.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors were able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the tax, tax and bank credit money, often meaninglessly issued obligations with which they disproportionately owed to their municipalities.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this appeal.
If we only adhere to official facts and verified, we discover that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is thrown ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the country, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the former government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have in the last few years been inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon they did not change the retirement age and pension reform then it will be the end of any policy in this country and, to govern who will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that government politicians will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
So this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal spending of the representatives' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want government politicians to become officials alone, so we must be patient and grant to this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and fees, tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Marking will receive more than a hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders, banks underestimate the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another $25 billion will make it easier for the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks on 11 September, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report for customers of the company Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of the central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions of dollars in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what is yet to be expected when they decided to take this step," said ABN economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to pay more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that environmentalists' debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are artificial word fires, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested people can now learn about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but he has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
The questions presented repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not consider the relationship between costs and benefits".
For the same topic, Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore failed to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that officials from time to the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's, hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without the valid carne.
According to traffic, it has not been changed mainly by those who don't even want to drive.
While the peoples are announcing a rapid decline in the change of meat, the metropolis offices are full of applications and the interest for the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers daily.
The queues are expected for half an hour.
In Prague some 140,000 drivers have not yet been drawn.
The issue of a new carné lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their card and do not reach it until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January onwards.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be awarded to a person who does not go anywhere.
They could allegedly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, at most.
According to the voice of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meat issued during the years 1964 and 1993 is no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driving licence.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty for the constable detectives of Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with delinquent David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final maturity the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department were going to complain about organized crime, in the beginning, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Against today's decision no longer can be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he awaits the trial of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this in other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 people in the robbery, and today the higher court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s accusations were rejected by the investigation because of the fact that they were invented cases.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid penalties.
These criminals committed 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge concerns criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they were also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without arms permits.
In the home registration, the police found guns, ammo with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš P't and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing children: 12 million
To change a few children in the Maternity House the counsel of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million compensation crowns plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers as much as 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostal, did not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"That demand we didn't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterpart asked to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissory value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal said.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for each month, that they didn't create their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol University hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better sustained by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women are taking it worse with the trauma they are now experiencing and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the motherhood house of Třebič last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error in the hospital of Třebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors they must draw from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far recognized a proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly one million crowns.
Polyvka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polyvka was not presented to the oral eye today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will return.
"The plea is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," he said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, in the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that therefore I might also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a matter of guiding him toward the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comemic origin came a lucrative business and business activity of which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and sign his passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team devoted themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among today's broken parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polyvka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the realm, through Harabiš, came from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something in clear might bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can introduce himself," said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: past prejudices
Actually, I've never really liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its gait features were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combo called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combo's bodywork means in this sense, that I'm not going to suffer before two meters in length.
Flying Around the World
I'm walking through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the invention of design even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backups.
Also unlike the 206 model, lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measures of the body have grown.
In the Combi the mentioned shortage of space in the head disappears.
Suitcases
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the abatable rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But we stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic regime has a capacity of 428 liters, which compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav's model, we find that Peugeot stays back with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's armpit its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the flat that remains fairly flat after cutting down the backs of the second line.
120 horses on four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection light on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a strength of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that looked down on the family five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škodas then that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was covered by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all pockets.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection light per 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headings, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's got the computer plugins in Fabian and it's going to come to a fairly similar number.
Now it is only necessary to decide for which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not part of English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries are attending schools, and so locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Europeans from the east for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of natives are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brocas among students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was nailing a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said the girl was insulting her child with racist tone insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two minor girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him, he made us the master of throwing apples and pears, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants of Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labour reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with shrimps offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Column called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything he had of crime in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, by wide avenues the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century ran.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had its yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of the world of show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Abánean Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel National mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already of worship of the 1950s, to this day continue to run for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived long ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating remarkably, there is no such wonderful colonial monuments around it.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly appreciated by the railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
His carriages for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose fraternal models in other parts of the world are found only in museums.
Where to go?
The most popular place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned farm there is a museum that for those who love the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exhilarating vegetation that grows on limestone rock lands.
Mogots, limestone poplars and high-scarpped rocks in the valley's falls, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting any of the pure habaneras factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone looks interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old-fashioned town that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Squambray saw, is a place so far away that in the 1950s there was no road to join the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and for that, neither, nothing destroyed, for each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby areas like the Ancón Beach or the sugar factory valley.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town on the west end of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful of the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Copper Charity, the Santeria, an African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed are what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country coincided with Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain saw the need to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid as a priority.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to make it possible for the population that they can only start economic and security development," said the BBC Defense Minister, Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew as compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in the Helmand province up to 60 percent.
The NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, from which the fourth part is in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar way.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters agency in closing the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Is Passive
Among the participating countries in recent months, there is a controversy as to whether all the allies are doing the most in Afghanistan.
He was passively criticized, for example, Germany.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the struggle demands there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensational newspaper Sun, this week, called vague German soldiers.
"The Afghan rebels find out that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting" wrote Sun in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech State, 84,000 crowns are required.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159 billion crowns.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year it rose to 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, there has been a decrease of 13,400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economics confirmed its data on the debt of the early October state.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," he said for the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it as well: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation in the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and comes, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the state is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns.
External debt has now grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroners.
The average government debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total inter-annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent of what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated especially from obligations where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the state's payment and debt management strategy for 2007 it is drawn that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, the ministry dropped the plan by 152,800 million crowns through improved state budget developments.
The amount consists, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns rather than the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13,300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state bonds and 1,800 million crowns for payments of European Investment Bank loans.
He was comparing in front of a court in Jartúm today to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British professor who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam had been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of having left students aged 6-7 giving the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was punishable by whipping.
This 54-year-old British high school teacher, based on the Unity High School in Jartúm in the Sudan, has been detained on Sunday at her house and charged with assault on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children in 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry he only asked the children to vote for a name ", it's only an " innocent mistake " he said.
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the Mohamed name is also the second name given in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules governing the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," stated European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " evident tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which regroup the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was responsible for a new mediation by the United Nations, last August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked independence in Kosovo from the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this high date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found " , announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these "last opportunity negotiations were held since Monday".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given some of his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned with a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean an engagement is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament shall have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
The journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu, had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be " in consultation " with the West.
Bush initiates an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference himself meeting on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He called for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to agree immediately to start negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute point between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations with regard to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main pelagic problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
On his way back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to making the upcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of his " vision of two " Palestinian and Israeli States " that co-exist at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it is attacked at the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Saud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as each time in this kind of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention, but in patrol, and it circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lightbulb," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left, after a breach of the marriage pass to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle proved negative.
The state of the car (the front unearthed, bumped windshield, shock torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of aid " to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the Public Security Department of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, namely that this mini-tocycle arrived relatively quickly to its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rustling of the footwear on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been trapped the time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not thus providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious fault " concerning this point.
" This is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, on which to be very prudent," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to cheer them up, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a police officer completely out of the blue, who was sneaking around.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the telephone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, the people who were present in the youth's unexpected situation, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, the rescues arrived " about 20 minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young men have been rescued.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor underlined.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, to the east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone fires, wounding the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court's lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement collected on Monday the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the wastes they swore to in front of Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the derogation measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court judgements " , the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army head and become a " civilian president no longer " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared on Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unexpected
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better "fertility domain", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years is from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
At last, eight births in every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuceed" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts had released the Discovery launcher from the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece to quickly host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for processing modules.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a solar panel power generation module weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a width of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds as accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less one meter by a wire that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who at first had to carry out a control exit from the Discovery launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to caracle at the end of 30 meters in length of the remote-directed arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skillful, has the highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been charged with "opting" the "inherited" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he segregated the wire and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had stayed close to the air-scraper and, from the inside, by other astronauts like Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a small hockey stick wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapuceed" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was finished, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the launcher Discovery for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently falling sharp at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS loses 4 % to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays resulting from the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which provides for the opening flight of the aircraft.
The cost of clearing the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus " , announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more cryptic accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, essentially because of loads linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians are going to opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends the voters a televised message about the public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new burden on the West accused of interference - his theme of choice during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and open elections, without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denounces a campaign muffled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziugonov says that there has never been such a dirty election until the Eltsin era.
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, the former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are prohibited visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008, the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
chosen in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Is it the leader of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russian party that the government and the president would choose?
Whatever the case, legislative elections as well as presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel the owner of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putine restored the model of a paternalist State, which was perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic shock " , María Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " give up personal responsibility by their own will " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What to reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote either by extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored on 27 km of shelves at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his/her possessor.
The 11 States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been concluded, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow search " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, had opposed the opening of these nominating documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to provide them with proof of their detention in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual petitions.
For a part of the scientific community, however, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now reaching around EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers had approved the European Commission in April to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in order to sign free trade with India, South Korea, and the Indo-European bilateral trade is now about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
EUA is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to European Commission figures.
" A free trade pact will do a lot of good both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. Asian and European giants change annually by " 47 billion euros of goods " and by " 10 billion euros of services ", he declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".The European Union and India are meeting Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current return of concerns on credit terms, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the basic index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of their expected reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , a communiqué indicates.
The bank states that £10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the Bank England BoE puts liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take further steps to maintain the indexes " of interbank loans online with its core index.
The day-to-day interbank index was Wednesday of 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was set at 6,6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important rate of penalty that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the euro changeover, many have preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties refuse to review PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text was included in a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), and it declined a decade of action taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including a 50% increase in surplus for employment, the reinstatement of the TIPP (inland rate for oil products) floating, a check-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of articles (180 voices against 115), the meeting was sparked at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between a majority and a few hours' opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Melvin Benn British producer's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has inspired, not least, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as " the most inspiring event " that he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and we worked with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-class policies because of the current administration, chasing Charlie Jones.
" Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare ourselves to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional site that, lately, takes place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resuscitated the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded their respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are conducted rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression in the European and urban way to the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but affirms "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very great", like that of the 80 000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been released to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed when he went under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His colleagues from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the duties of delegates.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the runaway productions.
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you're going there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," she says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is begun.
Every festival on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the end of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made based solely on statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they do not support the stock exchange taking the street in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest due to the lack of collateral alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the impact of the flight to quality values in both the long and short stages."
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because it is not known the impact of the probable decline of Fed types, given the high level of the raw and the danger of stimulus of inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, coincides with that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the peaks scored on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year more than 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates.
However, the expert softens that things will be something different this year because he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect market trends.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst for Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts them to be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says "this year it's up to the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the climbs will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low month.
The real year-end rally lived in 2003, when the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the push of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered by 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
You will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex has risen by 8.36 per cent since January) and if you can count on your end-of-year rally.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branch offices, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the popular experience will be crucial for other entities to focus on this initiative that supports trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal popular pursues with the project.
To capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a major investment, even if a higher recruitment of staff, since there are only about six employees per site to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
There are currently 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PeopleMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telefive first doubles the value in Stock of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With that phrase I expressed satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, the managing adviser of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain running duplicated the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Just one aspect of his joy haunted: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown up but because we've come down less', he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telefive ended yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain is your loss in what we've been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The value in the company stock exchange controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocent (another 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who gave up 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in Prisa (Five-Day Editor) and 1,779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telefive announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the managing branch of Telecinco and Publiespaña, who manages the advertising of the group.
To make this data real, the television network would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its billing of advertising compared to 965.4 million in the financial year 2006.
For its part, the net billing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio may vary after 33% of Endemol is purchased in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telefive in 2008 by 4 per cent and in 2009, by 7 per cent.
The projected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm has dropped Antena's profit forecast 3, 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: It recommends buying both values based mainly on its high profitability by dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Madrid box: Sees Telecinco better (acumulate) than Antena 3 (maintener) for the 'multiple attractions' and business rise.
3.
JPMorgan: It recommends to infrapond in both cases by having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consent to the best regulation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of entities for markets to function efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, entails the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial service firm (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are complemented by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, in order to facilitate the monitoring by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economy Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including the fact that debt titulated is considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delineate the functions that graduates can develop in economics and business 30 years after the real decree delimiting professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer collection services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that rising at 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy regarding the advance data today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16.800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he had recorded deposits of more than £25,000, a figure that had gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of 100 per cent of that money offered by the Government and which would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to achieve those remaining £18 billion until the target of £30 billion.
The group of the magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today in the first hour of the morning to the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretariats of the Consistorium and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, now a popular deputy, and until then a city director, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Agents continue to register the municipal units and the Urban Council and no further detentions will be ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER gave the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales yesterday, he was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in the press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and "Bono is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes" the missing politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on 15 November to not present himself to the next general elections and to leave his career in active politics to focus on combating climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since leaving it two years ago.
He has also pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If you reach the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government at one time interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good deed" and he has not wanted to see already taking up his position so as not to fall into what, he said, his adversaries might see as "prepotence".
Climate advertising
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to immeasurable persecution both the sceptics of their predictions and those that prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leadership of the EU in violation of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has occurred and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
It also requires the Spanish people to explain clearly what measures they will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences will be.
I mean, who's going to sacrifice and who's gonna pay to save the planet.
But there has not been or will be such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the amount of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
When it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend to travel by bicycle or cool with the fan.
Detained the mayor and chief of the local Totana Police for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city council secretary and a host businessman for possible urban crimes, today have reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units are currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also visited the Town Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought to justice today.
According to the sources, the former director of Totana and today an autonomic parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, who owns a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the former director's current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businesswoman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the mentioned group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, performed eleven records, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a very well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the lively parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way in the head of the PISA report on education level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that, curiously, criticism of Blackburn's book appeared there:
"The content of the Philosophy's signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor’s degree student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Discharge Crimes:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if disks are stolen in the store of less than EUR 400, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal at the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the charge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty continues to be lower than the charge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in compact exchange.
Participating in a tumultuous region has a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and exchange would be a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is leaving his hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor took me off one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been carried out through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life & Bran Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if, when both were successful, they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was higher.
I don't know if it required so much science this conclusion.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla is going with an agricultural taste, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain free.
His names are on that list, which takes his title as the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not stressed in Spain) who, at the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and press the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What's my insurance?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible loss, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the carne, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialised in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in return for its liability to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the seniority of the carne, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the vehicle, among others.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer an accident, more likely to pay.
That is why both older women and 25 have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of lack of care due to their prudence.
In addition, by handing the accounts, the companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with this the probability of having some kind of percency.
By increasing frequency the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured person, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages in hiring affordable insurance, such as the low driving experience and the seniority of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole risk with freeness, so that they get coverage of a insurance at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the client pays a part of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer brings will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage to third-party property, even if not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the sinisters as far as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, which may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be possible to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old strip drivers have it easier to hire insurance, as the rate of insecurity is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most advisable thing is to hire a whole risk with freeness.
"Usually, young people cannot make use of the previously acquired experience when using themselves in an accident, and even when driving", the director of the European company in Spain assures them, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation allows, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of sine-estrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with freeness (may be EUR 300), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to thirds extended from the third year of the vehicle’s life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchise," sentence Luis Noguera.
Retirement insurance is recommended for pensioners at all risk with freeness (if it is 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when a high level of bonus is available.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic seeks in Milan a point that is worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective objectives in closing the Liguilla of the Champions, as Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that it receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two parties in Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to contend the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on day 13 in semifinals looking for a square at the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would first and will ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to be ranked if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because on equal terms the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the Scots at night, who trust to get in eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were exactly defeated in that round the last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, in case the Celtic is lost, both to get in eighths and to follow the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they were dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the Vancouver GM Place stadium that the group's meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people exhausted the entrances to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that gathers its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage with a couple of bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowd that covered the GM Place, even though the nerves of Victoria had been banned days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought about why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other a lot."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
Upon his arrival at the airport, he was expecting an army of nannys.
Between the five there are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will be in California (US), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears of gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute before last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolistic owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the amount of money that Ukraine was to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay 50 per cent extra in 2008 for the gas coming from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must prove foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal records of employees outside Europe, said one vigilante.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel he counts with.
However, its report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the amount of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the gates of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted on the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of the alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The general auditor's report recommends, inter alia, that the boards should rely on the Criminal Records Bureau guide, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
BMA President Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have problems identifying what are employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon states: "It was of great interest that this work would be carried out following the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in movie awards
Control, the biographical film about the late singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named better actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at London Roundhouse.
Control continues the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But there was also winner Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic title of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded with two awards- to the best director and the best debuting director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a leader of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris prize for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmes the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, thus named Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and drivers of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell activists planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 to protect Abqaiq facilities, the largest oil plant in the world, following a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Minister of Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "mission-launching expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight projectiles into the country.
22 other detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active to stop Saudis who travel to Iraq to join as militants in Al-Qaeda to fight the Allied Forces and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunis.
Al-Qaeda militants have in their eyes many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - chosen by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as objectives the residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a great effort by the security forces, for five months' work," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on State television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing financial support and support to militants.
Venus climate can give you an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricanes and thunderstorms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from Oxford University's Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It's becoming clear why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when it's two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police seized "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which is declared to be enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is unworthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them for their dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions put on Wednesday afternoon November 28 were more ridiculous than the one of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party towards next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to applicants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest exchanges of words of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a punter in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed to the subject.
No one has the floor to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China's toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to its long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to respond if Jesus would be in favour, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unheard of.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul's fund-raising campaigns, and his heated statements on Wednesday's debate.
The two have come from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early party and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Laborious pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but likewise emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not appear to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor the sucking of extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Party of over 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister failed to call an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative record.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a middle-time job.
Now are David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is walking irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but usually suspend their unbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time, that suspension is more: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and not focused.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as a Chancellor of the Era.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blairish's countertimes - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died or been cheated directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charitable gifts, says that he does not want public recognition for his kindness.
This may be the case, but the decision doesn't make it.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown has not been involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these proceedings, although the bulk of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the job.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a committee of inquiry on the matter - to a large extent led by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of the funding of the parties.
This will require hard cooperative work by the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days' delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million jobs in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morocity and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of persons (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of morbidity) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for lenders were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But the issuers of the credit card look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the falling prices do not necessarily make a change in the lending capacity of the lenders.
They can even work to benefit the broadcasters.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decreases if the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt rises in the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid retaliatory of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
We have to keep an eye on those back fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were held accountable for their frauds with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became known in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, your case marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were that they had alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped their spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that it would be valued in height.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received close to 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed business appear successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with crimes last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"He has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy held at a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract the new Russians wealthy to all kinds of products, from caoba-crafted yachts to the diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a brilliant orange Porsche at the nearby stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Provided with fuel for the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was in high season.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, some 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London's jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the Sunday evening fair, dressed in evening costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design costume that he used as a network carpet veteran disbling with Joan Rivers.
The aim of the fair is to attract the new wealthy, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay in a warehouse that blends brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum plugs, Mövenpick ice creams, tables for charged swimming pools, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a reconstruction wall size of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that Russians rich in more trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires or tourists, fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton mixed with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche, for $17,000,000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for private requirements, said he had sold three car grilles in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted rays of Swarovski colored crystals, so that it would look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, does not necessarily drive on these wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price wave of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone cabins (British style) filled with stacks of $1 million fake bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking money batteries, asking their friends to take photos with their phones while resting on lots of money, or borrowing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
Chapuza surgery could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance climb," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, a helper to the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the house of 212 West Scott.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. It will help resolve the mysterious death that lies within the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and tenaz," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, leaving two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they came to the house about 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about your research or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered to the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marchito rosel is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmata stone in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainylline ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the door of the coachman, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's embarrassing."
Federal reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions at interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, Ben Bernanke, President of the Reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuing strain of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments under financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in the US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to the closure at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to Britain's first-order companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was above 2.3%.
Previously, it was highlighted the emergence of market credit tension after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, strained the credit and three-month loan rates "Libor" between the British banks, meant the higher rise since September, 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England judges the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris' desk, director of England, is beginning to fill up offers to become a national selector, and if not, in part time.
The one who does not get the sixth bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, as trials are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubebby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison claims to "fit and bowles" like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class jackpots in 33 races each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can be just a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did well in the first, with 5 jackpots and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of them.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of the early 88th in Bombay, 32 hundred first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias on the test in Lords, his house as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" some of the propellers that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex’s team has the joy of living on swords.
He's stuck for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flew his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, it's including his swing pass to have effects on his games that seem to satisfy him, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as suggested by the tea leaves, he is the one who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left with no cash, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on an official convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he states, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis to work in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him by telephone to tell him that an Allied U.S. force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of their stronghold to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from home to Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since U.S. troops were building groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighbours.
But many claimed to have returned because of the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectarian quarters of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiites and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one field of education.
"Yesterday I explained for fifty-th time to a non-Serlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves from the smallest federal state for his fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system, which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
Thus, higher schools by tradition have good relationships with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day students can finish their university career with two or three degrees.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students coming from Sarre is higher than average in higher schools, many of them do not have a baccillation.
"In the Sarre the system of vocational education is used," says Axel Plünnecke, the expert in the education sector at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than five young people make their bachelor’s degree at Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very broad.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has dropped one third in recent years.
That was why the Sarre Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this project has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late students in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Sarre didn't improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
For the sake of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another different time zone to the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez changed the schedule in South America by delaying the half-hour clock.
At present Chávez is becoming a comic in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan State Official Gazette, according to the new law, the time will be at least four GMT hours.
That way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose its obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia due to the action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not have any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until Conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country have to decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it involved the release of hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision that Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuing interruptions of left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in the real salary threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
The experts have many reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculation of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees are expected to have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain on food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also correspond to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent over the next year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office of work does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and grants to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social-Democrat Party.
On Tuesday it was reported that the rate of inflation with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother from Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most like the Earth, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and somolins in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on the Earth.
For three decades now, researchers have suspected that lightning could exist in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had given birth to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not like this: if there was one day there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface reign temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures under zero can be reached.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin of Earth, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question why Venus, so much like the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step in the investigation of Venus.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers, not only emphasize Venus' uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had expected," reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called a blue star or evening star orbits around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar is not much like Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been agglomerated on Earth that remained in the oceans, but on Venus it disounded in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the match between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Office.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democrat Party for his attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end the fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not introduce ourselves as one divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Ángela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely in force for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, the Federal President points out, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional Una China policy course.
China also knows," said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democrat Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Office caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democrat Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to sources of information from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of Chinese government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances like those in France will occur.
Battles with the police on the streets, shooting, car burn: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots, as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot at the police with rifles: after serious disturbances caused by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We need to look at each other that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"That we have to take seriously," said the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This applies not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It's still early to sit down the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as is the case in France.
Young people played a major role in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last night.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the performances are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age is above the average.
There should be more vocational training posts.
Kolat points out: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
"The opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly needs to be given."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, and a lighthouse helicopter overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Internal Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
The night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 police were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot started with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that nothing more has to be expected.
But what country does the Chancellor live in?
After her desperate action, indifferent and contentless in the general debate of the Lower House, she must say: she does not live in the country that should be ruled by her.
As to the reproach he was given for his repeated involvement in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive sentence.
He said that this would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was very clearly stated to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no sense of interest, no feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was very self-agreed by the decisions made in Heiligendammm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
So he's engaged in expressions so he can get a boost on people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are low-value appearances.
Poverty for children and concern for low-wage workers?
All she does is talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of Republican presidential precadians on YouTube and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates are already noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into "a shelter for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with grave reproach: "I want to say that his own house was a "door" for illegals." Giuliani answered the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favourite, the eight presidential precadents take advantage of the debate at the CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second small videos, filmed by internet users that were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach on his adversary Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to acknowledge as torture the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation, by allowing a person to drown his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when praising conservative values and denying the rise of taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains, "composed and asking for forgiveness from the people and the television audience for being a defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president took an oath as president.
This concludes the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as chief of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he was made with power with an incrusted military coup, the former general ruled for the first time the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many lawyers in support of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to information from the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restreno was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written at the best time of the band.
They were already very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the feeling.
Each one of them has before him his box, his cables, and above all his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was back in music.
What we have to rebel here is the following: the questions have shown that the name of the band rumbled in people's minds, but it was not as special as that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can't Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to the members of the band Can 2003 of Cologne for their life work, in the room they could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent his time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he were an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years and at those times did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it later obtained it thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruins of the 16th century, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an association banner appeared in Ottenstein's song harmony in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmony" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed her desire to propel Harmony and do occasional essays.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on themes of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since then has been more successful than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanking Groenemeyer.
His Grenland music company became a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Snow! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony took the position of a superband, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of pictures in black and white, where instruments with cables are seen.
At the bottom there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix microphones to the organ and battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Today electronic music is just like it had to be.
Three people who dig into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting it is coughed, sweated and in a good moment of emphasis it is said "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
It was not looking for the origin of gender in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here shouts "68!" he's right too, but now Harmony keeps calm.
In the scenario you think very well about what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they were not very convinced.
Or the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the interior darkness of the country during the war in Bosnia, was once again discovered actor Richard Gere.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most handsome man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the movie titles have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: deep down, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destiny and the film industry had not been so merciful with him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his decadence had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", in spite of this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be described in a few words: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, one of whom acts very fast and that also leads to her falling in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm be Cobra 11" without highways, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another script author (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story about the American reporters in the war who went to detect a Serbian war criminal called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce Simon Hunt, to him who is not simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will then kill.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed accomplish what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who went to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to get revenge in a just way.
It is so bad that they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, one deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and points out that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his sight, sharing feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that hard is to be good.
The problem consists not only of the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star goes through a region of crisis or the mining fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "bloody diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood steals a good film about the holocaust by using the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) comes directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because scriptwriters don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) in telling good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that the Nazi regime was in fact so bad.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant look at an artist.
When he was asked about the parallelisms between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympics in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that we have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, stated Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, political and sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympic Games did not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sportbund, which is expected in early December, on Munich's request for the Winter Olympic Games of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, we so far thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will not have any opportunity."
Despite all this, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined," said Günter Ploß, HSB's director on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is inconsistent with the statement by the head of the Senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public sports Federation of the higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for universities in 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the sports Federation of higher schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) accused the Senate that it did not take such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small neighbourhood of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who connects the terms Sweden and the wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm Museum carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stocolmo type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that they had "Brillo" soap powder.
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Museum Moderna Museet there were exposed hundreds of Brillo-boxes of cardboard. These did not make them Warhol (because of expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
It was not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a light box of wood, but were not exposed at the Museum Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now talk about that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and sprayed their silver pressed and then painted them to oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the silvers pressed. Furthermore, it is not oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Museum Moderna Museet and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Museum Moderna Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects."
Already in Julio The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "severe accusations" in which these are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained silent at all.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had surrendered to a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, reproaching the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been locked in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the trial on Thursday for having attempted a coup d'état in 2003 that ended with a failure.
It took advantage of the negotiations, so that it could suddenly be deposited with about 30 supporters.
The military police who had to monitor him had evidently gone to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"The people are loaded," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move on to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite squad Scout Rangers, said soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months your government has been reproaching for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at democratically elected government coup d'états.
United Internet will be the biggest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company's shares.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
It's only 20.05 percent of the capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the absorption of the company.
There are also options for increasing the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (digital subscription line).
On Wednesday, they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution retains the participation titles for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day had almost 10 percent participated in the Dillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch has put 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in the capital expansion measure.
United Internet has bought from them 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained United Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be content with the 10 percent participation of Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, make participation to 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third Freenet quarter it had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet participation.
Then they had agreed that Drilllisch was going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
