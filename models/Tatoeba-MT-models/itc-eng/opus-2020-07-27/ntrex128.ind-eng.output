The members of the Council (AM) Welsh are concerned if they ‘have hit like a muppet doll’.
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that they should be changed to MWPs.
This arose because there was a plan to turn the name of the Majelis into Welsh Parliament.
The AMs all over the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite any excitement.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's called it a twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "not happy" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Conservative Welsh said that his group "open mind" to change names, but judged that this is a fight against MWP being Muppet.
In this context, Welsh is a letter in English, like U.S. Yorkshire.
The Council's current committee has set up laws to introduce a change in the name, saying: "The last decision on any explanation of any name for the AM is of course an issue for the members themselves."
Wales' decision 2017 gave the Council of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the public consultation results on a proposal known to be widely supported to refer to a council as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the problem called AM, the Commission prefers WMPs (Wellsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but MWP options get the greatest support in public consultation.
The AM appeared to have proposed alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could have left behind the chief, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the plans for the change in a few weeks.
This reform will include other changes-- changes on how to work in writing, including rules disqualified for AMs and committee system design.
The AM will get a final voice on the question of what they should be called when they discuss the invitations.
The Macedonians went to give a voice to the referendum on the change of the country's name
The voice owners will determine whether their country's name will be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic."
It was held in an effort to resolve disputes for a decade with Greek neighbors, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country to the north shows a confession to her territory and has repeatedly rejected the EU’s membership offer.
President Makedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voter against the vote for a change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change of the name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bell bells were undivided when the churches in Harlem were having trouble.
"Historically, the parents I spoke to said were a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's none."
He said that all those bars could be explained.
"People socialize in another way" now, he says.
"Bar is no longer the public's living room where people visit it regularly."
As well as with the church, he was concerned that money from the sale of assets would not last long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by the apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help to keep the sacred places around it.
"The majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore it will speed up the day when these churches are closed simultaneously because it is impossible for those moving to these buildings to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by a white church before Harlem became a black metropolis - metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin’s, a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
The black bodies of the surrounding area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black church under the leadership of President John Howard, who led a boycott skyscraper on 125th Street, the main road to shop in Harlem, who refused to work or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but when Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they built tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his replacement in St. Martin proudly called the bell tower "Lanceng the poor"
An expert who sounded the bell tower in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an unchangeable historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also notes that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind who switched on to ring a larger tower bell in the 18 years ago Church of Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin for the past few months is a complex history of architecture and contractors, some of which have been carried by the regular church leaders, and others have been carried out by the Bishops.
The vestry body - the executive body, formed by public leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that "will try to burden the costs" on the vestry, even though the vestry was not involved in the architectural recruits and contractors that were sent by the commission.
Some parishioners are complaining about a lack of transparency from the institutions.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds in lobster rescue in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobster in California in the lobbyer's opening ceremony, at the expense of an officer.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in the Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drowning with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was just a thrill after catching lobsters, but then he "satisfied" that the boy shouted, "I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
Hammel said that he realized when he caught the kid.
"I screamed to everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego where he was dealt with in a critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles Beach Rescue said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week before, but it was classed as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries on the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed access to the coast from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
The sciencebury plan hit the English beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty kios-kios styled toserba style managed by specialized assistants.
As part of the substantial push towards the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household equipment down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more shops next year if it proved successful.
Investment in beauty is a hunting ground for the supermarkets to take advantage of racks that were used to be a place of TV, microwave, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the price of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more room with a brandy area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launched a remodeling of its boutique makeup, so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - things that are increasingly desired by young farmers.
In addition, the perfume hunter Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury stores, the first one opened in Croydon. London south of last week, while the two will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Online shopping and switching to daily food supplies in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to get people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of sciencebury, has said that the geers will be more and more like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back teachers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and without food.
Sciencebury has placed Argos' movements in hundreds of shops and has also introduced some Habitat since they bought those two warheads two years ago, which he said has supported daily food sales and made an acquisition more profitable.
Previous supermarket efforts to renew beauty and pharmacy departments ended with failure.
Sciencebury tested the efforts of the Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceuticals shops to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical warden Lloyds, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was told that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of fancy leather care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of sciencebury, said, "We've changed the look and nuances on the beauty kios-kios to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand series is designed so that according to all the needs, the surrounding environment and the comfortable location will show that at present we are an attractive destination that challenges the long-spoiled way."
Peter Jones "shrinked" after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal
Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones went "with a temper" after TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby drew himself from a business-style deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the branding of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
This couple's business is likened to a Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrew.
This Morning, 37-year-old carrier, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' star" Den, Petes Jones is madly attracted at the last moments, from their lucrative lifestyle business--to focus on his bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was so "strong" when the golden girl TV admitted during a rendezvous meeting on Tuesday at his business royal office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meaning he no longer had enough time to devote himself to the brand of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
Their business has been equated with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptrotow and is estimated to double Willoughby's wealth by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would last him for a few decades to come.
His decision to back down makes all the people involved really stutter.
No one can believe what happened on that Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the travel of this Morning's event, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can damage the company up to millions of dollars because of massive investment in product form, from pillows and candles to clothes and household equipment, and there is potential for further launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and Tara Capp's wife for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March.
This couple is on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent shares on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV carrier named I'm A Celebrity.
A close source with Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously ‘and then we fall in love’
He's joking about the criticism he'll get from the news media because he makes comments that some people consider to be "unpresidential" and has been very positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said it was his "stupid reader" with a funny voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for the collapse of North Korea.
But the negotiation of incriminating has been halted.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, the highest diplomat North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Council on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate responses" from the United States against the initial movement of North Korean weapons.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued its intention to keep pressure.
Trump's more optimistic about his speech.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing the relationship with Kim has brought positive results - stopping the rocket experiments, helping free hostages and returning remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this rough arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and the Storm Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for providing international assistance.
"In a lot of cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they're not asking for international help, so this is rather challenging," said Mr. Summone.
While Save The Children is teaming up to go to Palu, it's not clear if the foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster relief agency speaker, said that the Indonesian government was reviewing the situation at the Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared for the anger of nature.
While the site of tsunami protection was built in Aceh, it was not a public view of the other shoreline.
There are no tsunami warning sirens in the Wooden, although a threat warning has been issued, it is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, the journey between many islands of Indonesia was very challenging.
Natural disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
The auxiliary hospital that has been located in Lombok to care for the victims of an earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has built damaged Indonesian infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on road and rail development.
However, the lack of funds has disrupted Father Joko’s government as he faces his next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko also faced the pressure of ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim members of the majority had embraced more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian hordes fought on the streets, using bullies, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea at the Premier League with one score in a minute to 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from outside the Chelsea rag when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it to a distant pole.
The ball rolled high above the rag when the ball plunged to the right corner over the net.
The ball finally fell past the Arrizalalaga that jumped and fell into the net.
"That's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it in front as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just take a kick."
Chelsea led with 1-0 score at the first half after Belgian player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave the bait to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before turning near the middle line and running fast to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle line.
He then made a perfect kick, led Hazard to the ghang.
Hazard managed to get past the rivals and kick the ball to the ghangle corner with a left foot kick, past the Liverpool Alisson Becker kit.

The killing of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832.
The death toll on the earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami had increased to 832, the death penalty for the country’s disaster agencies on Sunday mornings.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 Richter scale that struck Friday and triggered a wave of up to 20 feet high, says Sutopo Purwo, an institution speaker at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which lives more than 380,000 lives, is filled by ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Murder investigation has been done after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Road, at 7.55 a.m. with some coughing wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come face-to-face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still at the earliest stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's road at Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might record something on the docks camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, the friends who felt sure that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on like the police have said, they're in the process of telling the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
That man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
The citizens are now being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer sounds like he's telling someone that all areas are now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up at a crying location.
He's always saying, "This is so awful."
By 2:00 p.m. the police van is on the line and the others are on the outside.
A number of officers stand in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone who has requested information to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The statue of the Cromwell Parliament became the last memorial of the re-history script.
His expulsion would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many British artifacts and religious acts by the fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace will be targeted.
The British brothers' war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell offspring would be sacrificed for Thomas' ancestor actions in the previous century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft was a 19th-century evidence of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a advocate of parliament against outside pressure, in the case of the realm of course.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still a subject of a continuing historical debate.
which is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation’s development, and Cromwell is a person known for representing one side of the difference.
He is the Lord of protection."
Pig Killer Endangered Chinese Farmers Until Died
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to a local media report.
The man, who was identified only by the name of the trademark "Yuan", was found dead with severed arteries, covered in blood near a pig cage in the Liupanshu province market of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine to the pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
She was reported to have gone with her cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, her cousin found her dead, and seeing the pig's door close by has opened.
He said that in the pig's cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that a male pig weighing 550 pounds has been insulting the farmer to death, based on a report.
"Bite my cousin bleeds and breaks," said the cousin known as "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras show Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent an attack on others, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the reported market authority are negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite rare cases of pig attack on humans, it has also happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts that caused severe injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a six hundred-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife was afraid and drove the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive but the smell of blood could act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing games.
They're biters, very curious to know... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storm brings heavy rain to the west of the United States.
As expected, the storm of Rosa collapsed as it moved above the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause floodwaters throughout Mexico’s northern and western parts of the United States to come a few days later.
Rosa has a wind at 85 mph, storm Category 1, beginning at 5 am. Sunday time East Region, and it is 385 miles southwest Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the parrot began to be formed on the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the U.S. West Coast, when Rosa approached the border of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical moisture toward the north to the south of the U.S.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico’s territory on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with nearby marshes will create abundant rains in the West Day for a few days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous bandage flood, a stream of debris, and possibly a longshore in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause the temperature of rain to close to 2 to 3 inches per hour at a number of points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is estimated that 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 cm] of rain is coming down in some parts of the West Day, especially in the vast majority of Arizona.
The flood may occur with a rapid deterioration of conditions because of the widespread tropical rain.
Very unwelcome to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could cause a flood and lead to harsh local winds and dusty floods.
Nearing sticks will cause heavy local rains to some of the southern California coast.
Total rainstorms over half an inch are quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the roads to become slippery.
It will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before it becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will extend to four corners on Tuesday and survive till Wednesday.
In October, there will be some great changes in temperature across the U.S. when the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in the short distance.
There's an exact example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. middle region on Sunday.
There was a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer heat will be formed and renewed.
Most central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warmer in October at 80s spread speed from the South to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show high odds of temperature above average for the eastern U.S. until mid-October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an exciting statement on Thursday by the candidate Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of committing alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political collapse continues, with publishers organizing regular events to report unexpected events at the last minute of Friday: A deal that Senator Arizona Jeff Flake had planned for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman is 100 percent sure that if Kavanaugh takes his body drunk and tries to take off his clothes at the middle school party at the top.
Kavanaugh, in his burning testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There is a possibility that over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have watched it.
The company calculates average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for another network broadcasting this are not available quickly, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty in counting the number of people who witness it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers who are almost equal to the playoff football or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which has its host's opinion strongly supported the show of Kavanaugh, superior to all the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire congregation all day, says Nielsen.
ABC's second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
Wanted to stay high after the trial.
Flake was a key player in that Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday mornings being hoarded by a taste show when he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee congregation.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he's being scrambled, aired straight at CNN.
"I stood right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."'
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee congregation.
Cable TV and the broadcast network all directly covered a few hours later, when the Justice Committee will choose to introduce Kavanaugh's call to the whole Senate for vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with an understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate for a week ahead, as the Democrats have asked.
Flake has been confirmed by some of the conversations with her friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
Finish the conversation with the Coons and some senators after that, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republican Party won't have a voice to approve of Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused Brexit of playing politics
Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticism of "political play" with the future of Britain and disrupting national interests, of his plan to get out of the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews showing him on the front page of the paper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about England and the EU to raise the price of each other was "it's entirely unreasonable."
Wayde shooting Sims: Police caught Dyteon Simpson suspect in LSU's death.
The police have caught a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree murder charge, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officers released video confrontations between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost her eyeglasses during the fight.
The police found the glass on the scene and said that they found Simpson DNA on the stuff, the WAFB CBS affiliation reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he had committed fatal shooting at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The Coroner Parish Baton Rouge East released an earlier report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department is grateful for the emergency of Louisiana State Police, state police criminal labs, Southern University police and citizens around to assist in the investigation that leads to arrest.
Athletic director LSU Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement officer for "dependency and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old then.
6.6 feet tall lives in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also plays basketball for LSU.
The average point he's 5.6 and popped up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "surprising" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," says Wade.
Fire Mountain ripens ashes in Mexico City
The ashes that came out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern area around the capital of Mexico.
National Disaster Prevention Center warns the Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after the activity is increased in the ear and registered there are 183 emissions of gas and ash in the course of more than 24 hours.
The center regularly monitored the heavy loads several times and made changes.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ash hanging on the front of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity on a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the city capital since the 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
This Fire Mountain is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
The police are in conflict with the Catalan separatist to celebrate the election of independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturdays after the pro-freedom demonstration group with anti-hurus police, and when thousands joined in with a competition demonstration to mark the first Catalonia's polarization rally celebration of self-sustainment.
A group of pro-separatist masks held by anti-wage Hara police threw them with eggs and threw powder paints, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would usually be filled by tourists.
The dispute also occurred after that day with police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For a few hours pro-freedom groups shout "Don't forget, no forgiveness" in front of the cheerleading union chaplain, "Spanish Life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protest, the local press reported.
The tension remained high in this free-oriented region, one year after the referendum of October 1 that Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters prefer to be free, although the low number of voters with those who oppose separation and most of them risk selection.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote on the GST throughout the region in a fierce battle.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separate protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we went through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for choice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having managed to win a vital victory in a few regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-freedom parties have fought to maintain this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in custody or in custody awaiting trial, on their role in organizing the referendum and next declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded protests with his phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"This is getting more anxious," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan pre-trial leaders since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the election of the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to address the decline in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car

That incident happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage happened on the gate door and the building itself.
A crosshole bow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
The goal that Menga printed has given Livingston victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Meng's first goal for Livingston is to secure the victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as the manager of the Ibrox club, on his second defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference in the movement by Gary Holt's side in line with Hibernian's second order.
The Gerrard side remains without victory in this season's Premiership and facing the leaders of Hearts who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers were watching Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their invincible record at division into six games, while Coach Holt's head still won defeat since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston lost a chance against a sloppy guest team
The Holt team was supposed to be superior a long time before they scored a goal, with the precision of the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts failed to cross the ragang face, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after launching in and facing Craig Halkett's support across the ragang.
The host is satisfied to let the Rangers play in the first place, knowing that they can make a difficult living for the visiting team over the death ball.
And that's how to generate a very important goal.
Rangers have a free kick-off and Livingston get a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson join to help Menga, who get a turn and score from the middle of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers have dominated the rule but realize that the defense of the house cannot be breached and Liam Kelly's fangs are completely untiring,
The pattern continued until the second round, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure out of Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was nailed by the foot of the Rangers gawders Allan McGregor and Lithgow far apart from the other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continues to come to the Livingston rag and continually be avoided, while two criminal claims--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for the handball--refused.
Livingston's Phenomenal - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alaska Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they're extraordinary, always beyond hope at this ever-increasing track.
Their play style and personal almost didn't change since they came back to the top board, but the big credit should be given to Holt over the way he reinforced the team since he came.
He has so many champs.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading well organized defenses, while making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall keep alert during the game.
Still, Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time below Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once they could break the formation of the side of the house - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan was given a different welcome in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky for Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day that President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They argue about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkish entry to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open up a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons to block the crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan shells - many of them Kurds - are also vocal, threatening both, Erdogan policies and the German government’s decision to welcome them in the country.
The resistance protest describes the opposition to the existence of a visitor who is welcomed as a hero by some German Turkish people and is looked upon as a dictator by other people.
Breakdown on the Deptford Road: The driver of the bicycle was killed in the crash with the car
A bike driver was killed in a crash involving a car in London.
A collision took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city about 10:15 B.C.E.
The driver had stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after another bike driver died in a runoff at Childs Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan police said that the officers were trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The road is closed and the bus routes have been diverted as well as the motorists are escorted to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in haras
Six wardens suffered injuries in a riot in a man's prison with strict custody, the department said.
The chaos occurred in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sundays and continues to run.
"Tornado" Specialist officers have been forced to deal with these concerns, involving eight prisoners and happening on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene because the wounds were mild in the face.
One speaker said: "A specially trained fireman has been forced to deal with an incident in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison housed more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison head was treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, anti-hurus officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots where a fireman was attacked with a biliary ball.
storm Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Bandang Flood
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely occurs, but that is likely to happen early next week because of the trace of the remaining storm of Rosa's energy through the western desert, resulting in a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of a flood of raids on Monday and Tuesday for the region of West Arizona to South Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit on Monday night with rain.
National weather services in Phoenix mention in twitter that there are only ten tropical masks capable of generating tropical storms or depression status in 200 miles of Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles of border AZ."
The latest storm power plant is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain loss with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other western desert areas include central Rockies and Great Basins, likely affected by 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of 4 inches of isolation.
For those in the free swimming area, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of these rainstorms are likely to benefit because the western region is now in the process of drought.
According to the U.S. U.S. U.S. fire extinguishers, only about 40 percent of Arizona's region has some extreme dryness, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the route across the storm Rosa leads to land across the California coast of Mexico.
Rosa, still in storm power on Sunday morning at the wind speed 85 miles an hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm met the cooler watery area in the Pacific, and that was why it was weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or at night.
High rainstorms may be high in parts of Mexico, risking a high flood
"Total rains 3 to 6 inches are estimated to hit the California Bay to the western area of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa would cross the northern part throughout Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and to the southern Utah in the middle of the night.
"The main risk that could be caused by Rosa storm or the rest of it is very high rainstorm in Baja California, the northwest area of Sonora, and the U.S., the western desert area of the U.S.." National Storm Center (NHC) stated.
The rain is expected to cause a flood threat and debris that flow into the desert, and there is land that extends to the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four murder suspects
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The young men were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsome Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital where he's in a "stable" condition.
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, police said.
Officers have been calling anyone who might have the video footage of the incident on his cell phone to come and report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘received hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to refuse the assassination of the brutal and shameful Democratic Party," said Trump at a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the process of stalking
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he committed sexual violence to him a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to stir up someone who has the most perfect legal thinking in our time, a jury with true public servant footprints," he said to the West Virginia supporters crowd.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh as he talks about the importance of the participation of the republics in the mid-election.
"Fifteen weeks before it happened one of the most important elections in our lives.
I wasn't running, but I really did," he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democracy was on a mission to "fight and block."
The first voter procedure at the Senate level in the Kavanaugh racer is expected to be carried out at least late Friday, an assistant senior GOP leader said on CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an earthquake in Indonesia, tsunamis, with increased casualties.
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed when the huge waves hit the shore, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a sea of six feet (18 ft) destroyed the beach at dusk, caused a lot of death and destroyed everything it passed through.
Tsunami is followed by an earthquake with the power of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat escalated yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and were not running away, so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker for the Disaster Relief Board (BNPB) said at the time of suicide in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, timbers, houses, covered everything in the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea off at 800 kph (497 mph) before it crossed the coast.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people evacuated to 24 centers of service in Palu.
The photo released by the BNPB shows many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were bent and amber, and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The flurry of revolutions shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Research and Technology Board (BPPT) said in one statement that the energy emitted on the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb power dropped in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the edge of the narrower bay, can be said to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage that happened as "extensive" and states that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruined building ruins, he said, adding that there are 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be larger along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggana, which was closer to the earth’s earthquake center.
Communication "really crippled with no information from Dongala, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," says the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy, but it could get worse," she said.
The instance of that Saturday received much criticism because it did not inform the public that there was a pole - length tsunami, even though the authorities said that the waves had been prolonged at the time of the warning.
An amateur record shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a sounding building warning with panic that there will be a tsunami approaching, towards those on the street below.
Within minutes of the beach flow of water, envelop the building and the car.
Reuters can't immediately prove the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunamis were the biggest causes of electric blackouts that communicated around the Palu so as to make it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military forces have already started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees are still in great need of food and other needs.
The airport was reopened just to make further calls and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center of Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian Tsunami victim is rising above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Dongula have managed to safely to the town of Palu, where the officials sheltered in the tiled tent that was built in their office yards, on their journey they have passed through various areas of perchance, says Father Doseba.
"They told me that they've seen many houses that are destroyed," she said.
That's terrible.
Even when relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster removal activities, some of them complained about the intrusion of experienced foreign volunteers to go to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, the provision of foreign supplies and energy can begin only if the affected areas have been officially identified as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the government said, OK, this is a national disaster," we could receive international help, but there was no such status."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the lost victims still hope that the people they love will be part of the miracle that will repair the natural disaster story.
On Saturday, a boy was brought out from under a glass.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman who had been lying under the rubble for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesian national paragliding team coach, has been a coach for two missing paragliding athletes, who managed to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Father Mandagei, are his disciples.
"As a senior in paralyze, I have a personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how after news of the Roa Roa-Roa Hotel that had been destroyed, leaving around the paralysed community, with despair he sent a message WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who also participated in the celebration on the beach.
However, all the messages, only got one mark of gray cents, instead of a two-color blue one.
"I think it means unsent message," he said.

Rapper turned his name into Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced a change in his name by Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The first thing that was formally known as Kanye West."
West, age 41, already has the name Ye for some time and uses it as its eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before his performance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to write his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform at the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, formerly West said that it had religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' West said earlier this year, discussed the title of the album with the broadcaster Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only to become Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our misfortune, our confusion, all of it.
It's more of a mirror of our real self."
He's one of a number of rappers that changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year it announced its preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-laborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connections and letters.
President Mexico, AMLO, swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
The President elected Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military power against the civilian community until the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the student.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to press the Mexicans."
The troops launched a fire on peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of the left wing students planted its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly benefits for those in college and opening more universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education spurred young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the A.I. funding.
Since China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding that will be used for research in the field, the words investors and A2 Kai-Fu Lee practice, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made an announcement about AI, even when the U.S. was a total lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China identified its plan last year: aiming to become the number 1 in the 2030 innovation.
"An increase in AI funding is a good start, since all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Double funding can double the opportunity so that the next major achievement of AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that beats the best American Othello player, and after that he became an executive in Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognized the U.S. government technology competition as a Robotic Challenge for the Final Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win a prize from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China taking the lead in academics; it's a company," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired high-tech professionals from the university for research in the past few years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to support the efforts of AI.
"I think the green card can be offered automatically for the PHD holder in the AI field," he said.
China's National Council issued its next Generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions the same way as the Nature Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for the Design Intelligence Committee.
And this month's DARPA announces 2 billion dollar investments in an initiative called the next AI.
As for NSF, DARPA recently invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Art Intelligence did not see any further action for months.
Macedonian citizens do a vote in order to change the name of the country
The Macedonians made a vote on Sundays to decide that the name of the country should be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic," an action that would resolve conflicts for a decade with Greece that had denied its membership offer to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of its neighboring northern state represents a confession of ownership of its region and has forbidden to join NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached the agreement in June on the basis of the new name, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most of Slavia's ethnic population Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign had raised doubts if the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes required to be declared valid.
The question is: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting any agreement with Greece?"
Supporter of name changes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying to get permission into the body like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's destruction.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the younger generations of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Even if not legally bound, there are enough members of parliament who say they will follow the result of voter action.
Rename changes require two to three voice access in parliament.
The state election commission says there's no record of the breach by 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the result of the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters gave their voice mail.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a picker in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice for general election in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country that will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, has prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents that those who are going to boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join honorably, not through the waiter door" said Kavarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonian, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more required investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe most people will approve it because over 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving the voice.
He said "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
Another poll, held by Telma Macedonian TV station, found 57 percent of the respondents who were planning to come and give their voice on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
In order to achieve the sound, it takes 50 percent plus 1 voice.
A failure in voting would represent a rejection of the first policy against the pro-Barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explored the entire Brighton defense to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were forced into Brighton's defense on Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory look very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
Argentine attackers received an opin in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three men defending Brighton, before the nanny entered the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four people of green colour.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of some other rivals at the edge of the Brighton gagang.
Then he operated on his left, to Sterling.
The British forwarder used his first kick from the gawg's point of view to open the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gawg.
"Aguero was struggling with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, the city manager to the reporter.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling's the one who gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
It happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball, deep in the Brighton area of the game.
He covered the ball with a far, dazzling kick through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little dripping ball before leading Sterling to the remote post.

Scherzer wants to trigger spoiler versus Rockies
With the elimination of the Nationals of the playoff game, there's no reason to force another match.
But Scherzer, who is too competitive, hopes to excel Colorado Rockies at the game on Sundays, but only if there's still playoff involvement for Rockies, superior in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies at most had no place to win in a wild-card match against Nationals with a 5-2 score on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we're playing without winning, at least we can figure out the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of audiences and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
Nationals have not announced the opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start a strike for 34 times, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.
Washington's right-hand picker is a 18-7 scorer with an average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President himself referred to a situation in which the Supreme Court had a choice, Brett Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the republican people's voice in the middle of the election.
"All the efforts we've done are at stake in November.
Five weeks before it took place the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "You've seen a radical democratic group that is very, very horrifying, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see the evil, their abomination.
They do not care who they hurt.
Democracy, he says, is on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrath and evil and vile and untrustworthy."
He referred to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate’s Court Committee, by mentioning the Senate’s name, which was greeted by the earnest inquiry of its listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Are you leaking the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting-- it's a very bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Force Party is no longer a public service site.
Now an intolerance to anyone who puts his mind on it
When Momentum activists in the local party I gave a voice to mock me, it wasn't surprising.
Moreover, I was in the last order of the Member of Parliament, who was told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed our views.
My colleague at the parliament, Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he defended anti-Semitism strongly.
In my case, it criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, the irony issue that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to earlier leaders.
Notice for the meeting of the Nottingham workers east on Friday states that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I have been a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on that very Friday night.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, indeed, it has begun.
Differences in opinion in the labor party are becoming clearer and are not tolerated and each opinion is judged by the party's authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became a leader, as I thought it would be possible to share the same political viewpoint, to start expecting me to turn around and accept the position that I would never have received before - both in national security and in the single European Union market.
Whenever I speak openly--and no matter what I say--then after that there will be a search in social media that calls for demonstration cancellations, attacks the central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me who had it.
Of course, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire professionalism and the limitations of my colleague who has faced sexual harassment or racism every day but never shunned.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today's political era is how rational the level of abuse has been.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer on a broader church and with every "unbelievable" motion or altering the selection of party rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice for two years ago that moved me to keep my head down, not too much voice, and then I'll say, "Okay."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by thatcher’s government veneration, which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have been trying to fight better public service for those who so desperately need it as local councillors and ministers in government.
I had never hidden my political action, including in the last election.
No one in the North Nottingham would question my policy position and things that I do not agree with in current leadership.
For those who encourage a move on Friday, what I can say is when the country moves fast towards the split of sovereignty (Brexit), it will jeopardize our state and public service business, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climb to top position
The last two trials may have been a little misleading, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they're in the top order, the only side that hasn't been defeated by ten.
In the end, their superior defenses and the ability to get the best opportunity, making the host team and coach Peter Murchie have the right to be happy.
"So far we've been testing our game, and we're still not beat so we're happy," she said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The appreciation for Ayr, they're better off taking a chance than we do."
Test Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but yellow card for captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given at the game by Warriors, gave the opportunity for Melrose to print numbers and Jason Baggot robbed an unconverted attempt.
Climo loosened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored a goal and then did a single experiment to make Ayr's score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and the experiment of Patrick Anderson, which was changed by Baggot, reduced the odds to five points.
And then there's a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious injury, being held out, and since the start of the fight, Ayr has been speeding up beyond the Stafford McDowall experiment, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson later hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with the unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard stress.
Mr. House has come back to play, but by the time Struan Hutchinson gets a yellow card because he glues Climo without a ball, from the penal line, MacPherson arrives behind Ayr's advanced wounded.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe had made a gawg kick and canceled the fifth effort of Gregor Henry's operator.
Still Game Star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Kieran star appears ready to move on to the service industry after earlier it was known that she was renamed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performance at BBC popular events, controlled and also starred with old comedy partners, Greg Hemphil.
The couple had announced that the ninth series to come was the last episode, and Kiernan appeared to be planning to drive the broadcasts right after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun narrative suggested that Kiernan tried to get involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Sailors served as patrollers at the La Paz headquarters.
Public buildings raised a flag of the blue sea.
The Navy Camp from Titicaca to Amazon is powered by a motorcycle: "The sea is our legal right.
To be restored is a duty."
Passing through Bolivia’s land, the memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict are still clear - as a desire to once again sail on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is likely to reach its peak in several decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a court ruling on October 1 after the five - year match.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope of results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ trial on the wide screen throughout the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that - after a few decades of such bold talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian president of the country who is charismatic in the face of a controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support for the trial on Monday.
"We've been very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court cannot decide on Bolivia's wishes - and that would only change a little if that were possible.
The Dutch-based UN bodies have no power to hand over Chile's territory, and it has already decided that it will not decide the outcome of the negotiations.
That ICJ's statement comes only six months after the final argument was heard, which indicates the case "not complex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's lawsuits, in the past four years, it may well be in decline.
"There's access to the sea already hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he says.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good ichtics of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain in dialogue, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussion after this.
Both countries have not exchanged large ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s vice president of Den Haag, quickly rejected the decision.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disputes with profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-also one of the most famous Latin American president-uses the marine issue as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never relinquish her right to have access to the Pacific Sea," she added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons are not going to happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Foreign Minister North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his country would never remove nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Congregation.
He referred to the United States to a deal that was made at a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
The comment appeared when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared almost at the beginning of nuclear diplomacy that had been destroyed for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says only a "one dream" that continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the Korean War will make North Korea surrender.
Washington was alert to agree to that declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to decommission the armed forces first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there's a doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the confession of the weapons warehouse that the country has become the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris mode show shows a lot of the latest collection of head closures to the main road near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight, don't look for anything else.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers released a series of big-sized cap caps for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage with a stunning style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The truly impractical hats have erased Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing creations that are eye-catching on the sports stage.
The highlight of Valentino is the cream-colored hat on which it is adorned with the wide edges of the fur tray covering the head of the model.
Large-sized accessories include diamonds, witch hats, and even a pineapple, but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange-and-exact mask group approaching Halloween.
Many colourful masks have been sewn and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creation that looks like a skuba-snorkel and glass, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep looking at the collection of that wide mode-- then you're being flattered.
Modekeepers estimate that the large collection of hats will be directed to the main road near you.
Big-sized hats become a very fast train in La Bomba, straw hats with a width of two feet are used by everyone including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a very impractical hat of social media makes a great creation on the beach spots of the huge straw almost equal to the swimwear - used with a cellular model.
The burning raffle bag, trimmed with a raisin on the edge with a white strap, is a remarkable thing from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity writer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has already made a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for such a large accessory"
John Edward: Language skills are important to global citizens
Scotland's private school keeps track of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test result, which is reinforced by every student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School Council (SCIS) work hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
The school is designed to prepare its students for higher and higher education, their careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement the curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be the subjects of popular choice and desired in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, you'll get into his head.
If you speak with him in his language then you will enter his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation in the primary school.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72 percent of students get A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get A.
This indicates that the primary school in Scotland supports foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents in the future would certainly need.
At this time, languages, as a choice of students, are held in the same standard as the STEM (saints, technology, engineering, and mathematics) school curriculums in modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Engineering and Skills Service in 2014 found that for some reasons workers had to keep fighting the openings, 17 percent because of the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their careers in time to come.
As the number of opportunities for work in need of speaking increased, this skill becomes an important feature of our worldwide work.
Whatever a person's career choices, if they've learned the second language, in the future they'll have real benefits because of having this kind of lifelong skill.
It is possible to communicate directly with people from a foreign country that will automatically make a superior multilingual in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov in over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in conversation and French as the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children now is important for now.
Having multilingual abilities, especially the language of countries with a growing economy, will divide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in England for a few years to come, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in the primary school, with the teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland's independent school is designed to provide an environment of learning that will prepare the children and divide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be ruled out that at present, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer options, conveniences, and this excellence for Scotland’s teenagers.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish School Council
LeBron's going to have a debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James escort his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James is going to play in the opening for the Sunday season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it hasn't been determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweet that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plan for the six games for Lakers.
"At the stage of my career today, I don't have to do the season games to prepare," he said.
Trump Public Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public meeting of Trump of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop in some pleasant places that includes Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stated that the vote was delayed so that he could choose to fill the Supreme Court, Trump intended to build support for his general election due to the risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was taken on November.
What time is Trump's public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia scheduled for 7:00 a.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via direct broadcast on YouTube.
It's possible that Trump will discuss this week's case for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who is becoming more tense after the charges of unspoiled sexual action and the estimates of the Senate's vote will be delayed until a week while the FBI investigates them.
But the main objective of this general agenda is to help the Republic party get some momentum in facing the November general election.
Therefore, in the campaign President Trump mentioned that this next week's five general meetings are intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," Reuters said.
"Control Congress is very important to his agenda so the president will probably travel as many countries as we have during the busy campaign season," the Trump campaign speaker who refused to mention his name conveying to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a public meeting tonight is expected to be able to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attracting coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be a second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state that he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was left behind in the polls.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an effort to raise his opinion gap," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team bravery defends its hope in face of single game Sunday
After three sessions one-sided, the Saturday afternoon foursome session is probably required in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of the momentum bandulum is a sports concept that is the result of the complete discovery of the players, and nothing greater than in this competition.
Where do they think the moment is right now?
"Before, they've risen to six points and now four, so I think we'd consider it a little bit of a moment," Jordan Spieth said as he passed that day.
Europe must have the advantage of exceeding four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little momentum and they had a lot of things that could be excited, no exception to the formation of Spieth and Justin Thomas that played together all day and each of them boasts three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tee area to the green area and led with the laxity.
The merry-goers were more fierce when their turn came, making the kicks important to make a series of games when he and Thomas lost two against two.
The putting punch of him who won them on the 15th that was greeted with similar screams, screams that told you that he was sure America didn't lose.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own fight," Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only player with points more than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story from Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't do bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they're also shunned by bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Monday morning.
The run, and how their energy seems to flow well to either of this luxuriant crowd that convinces them that they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and there are no more famous players than Fleetwood and Molinari who will lock up Europe's potential for victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both placed in a different hole.
Still, it is too early to speak of European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson slowed down the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front like digging holes that can never be hit by this Spanish and Swedish golf player.
Even though, on Sunday no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change for a while.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led far enough to the end day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team had the nerve to compete even though some parties doubted it, especially in the United States.
Upper Europe 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day Ryder Cup after the rise of fourball and foursome Saturdays with 10-6 over the United States.
The duo that inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend an unattainable trofi in Hazeltine two years ago, dominating the U.S. team that was mistargeted in fourball mornings, making this serial result 3-1.
The United States has given more resistance in foursomes, won two games, but they cannot reduce deficits.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points out of 12 single games on Sundays to defend the trofi.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational week, are only a second couple who win four points of the four openings of their games in the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they became very strong to defeat the slender Woods and the American debut Bryson Dechambeau with a tougher 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturdays, sometimes performing brilliantly but has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rest in the morning fourball, then go back to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lose 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- world rank one and three.
Europe doesn't reach it itself even though the day is fun and winding in the west of Paris.
The lead winner was Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas three times, who imposed two points for the United States on Saturday.
They won 2&1 win that was interesting for Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup where a team back from the deficit four points entered the single game, although as a champion surviving the Furyk team only needed serial points to maintain the trofi.
But after becoming the best of the second for two days, Sunday’s return attacks seemed to go beyond them.
North Korea says 'unprobably' will disarm side by side without any trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea made a statement to the United Nations on the ongoing sanctions against the United States and it was unlikely that the country would disarm its nuclear weapons on its own in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual Councils that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no self-confidence in our national security and in such a situation we may not disarm our own weapons first on our own."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "supplemented" approach to the investigation where North Korea would be punished for taking step by step, the statement stated that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit meeting between the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which was the first time held in Singapore on 12 June, at that time, Kim promised to make an effort to "conclude the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has officially wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to extend international heavy sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States is insisting on the "premises" and increasing pressure by giving semi-sanctions to their ends, and even rejecting "the declaration of the end of the war," means Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel down is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that those sanctions will increase our disbelief."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, the U.S. leader of the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister merely endorsed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the problem person in this field is South Korea and not the United States, the destruction of the Korean side won't reach this kind of dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Court that targeting North Korea rockets on United States land was a thing that could not be avoided after "Lord President Devil" Trump called Kim "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump last year threatened to "break" North Korea in total, he praised Kim for her courage to take steps to disarm, but that huge work still had to be done and sanctions still had to be done until North Korea made a denuccess.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- no problem," he said.
The Chinese and Russians believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Foreign Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, announced to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and must not fail until we find out that full, final and verifiable destruction."
Security Council with a round voice increased sanction for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop nuclear program and Pyongyang ballistic missile.
Pompeo met Ri in the wake of the UN General Council and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there was a real progress, only North Korea in the amount of stormy hours that he made "a lawsuit like gangster."
North Korea promises in a meeting with Moon this month to defuse missile sites and also nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He stated that Kim told him to do a "appropriate move" with his desire was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
High school Harvard took a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is developing through the 'man of ghosts' with the power of caffeine.
An academic discovered that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if they discuss the very basic thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep loss on the study.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I just be told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping - which shocked me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course was first launched this year, explaining to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletics, and improve their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who was very poor in bed all week.
The course for an hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there are images of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic results are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of routine sleeptime.
On the other hand, the patient gets an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with interactive icons, then stimulates the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the behavior of the student instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,'
The culture proud of the 'beautiful' still exists, as it were, plus that modern technology and the pressure that continues to increase in students that means lack of sleep is the problem that continues to grow.
Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, stress - even to avoid adding weight, because lack of sleep makes the brain activates the mode of hunger, creating a constant hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire college.
Next step, he hoped that the entire graduate student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider regulating the alarm during bedtime, also raising alarms, and realizing the effect of the 'blue light' emitted by the electronic screen and LED light, which can move your circular rhythm out of the way in which it acts so as to cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga mentally lowers Gerrard's army
Again, the Rangers felt heartbreak during the Dolly Menga attack, delivering Steven Gerrard's team that was buried in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibox team tried to record their first victory on their way, since their 4-1 victory in February at St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his team to leave eight points left by the leader of the class Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and the unreasonable Rangers do not seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, only left a single goal of Hibernian.
And there could be more problems in Rangers' chamber after Calum Spence's line guard had to be treated for head injuries after an object was thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that glimpsed Ayr into the semi-final Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt went with the same 11 Livi who took a point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that haunted their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they own better.
They should've recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait Meng was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's rag, but it's making that big opportunity too wide.
The deep-rooted pride of Jacobs, when he met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only stab wide in the back position.
Rangers took control but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless crashed at a quarter-hour mark but listened to Steven Thomson from this Colombian public.
Rangers only managed to do two throws in the first round but former Ibox guard, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head restraint and easy-to-relief Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposed to the path of the fight, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep death tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put a ball at Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at rest by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that replacement almost gave direct effect when the wing player placed a ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of the line to attack.
But Livingston keeps forcing the farm team to play the exact game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett wiped out all the long balls.
The Holt team was supposed to expand their excellence at the end stage but McGregor stood up fine to drive Jacobs before Lithgow across the corner.
Ranger replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed to penalize again when he disagreed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almanac: The Guest of Geiger’s Breakdown
And now from our Sunday Morning Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the task is to be stopped... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was a discovery that finally made the device called Geiger Breaker.
Being the basic tool of science since then, Geiger's shredding has also been the source of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring cowboy scientists who seem less convinced of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's Breakdown, used to find radioactive mineral locations, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atom released by radioactive activity in the mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it's going to happen now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to ‘know’ evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach immune systems to 'know' evil cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches an immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, converting them to labs.
They can then become familiar with common proteins in many cancers and then re-injected.
An experiment vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches an immune system to recognize evil cells, her ovary cancer is gone for over 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, turning it into a lab so that they can "know" the protein that is generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cell back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increasing some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectals, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach as the removal of patients' immune cells and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
The West Kanye started Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing MAGA hats, after its SNL appearance.
Not Running Well
Kanye West whispered in the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a mess where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would run himself in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a charade that Matt Damon starred in Hollywood laughing at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the claim of sexual violence that Christine Blasey Ford made.
Although not broadcasted, the West's tapes were posted to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock's trying to make fun of West with the odds.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble at the back of the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They subverted me behind stage.
They said, 'Don't come out with that hat.'
They're falling for me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "You want to see a drowning place?" saying that he's going to wear Superman's clothing, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do.
Try to love."
The comment yielded at least twice the audience and the SNL was embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person saying, "All studios are silent."
West was brought in at last moments as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, a former rapist friend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with the appearance of I Love it, dressed like the Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner, who wrote tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: LOVE HAS BEEN RACKED."
But the bearer of Karen Hunter's event wrote tweet that West was just "being himself and it was really very good."
"But I don't choose to give anyone any gift (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his art) that I believe in shrinking and extorting ideologies that are dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," more so.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature who is officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's trail, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
As a rap singer, Snoop Dogg gets the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of Prince music, turning his name into a symbol and then an artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizes poisonous masculine
The Harington Kit is famous for a blade swing in his role as Jon Snow in the mid-century fantasy series of violent HBO Game of Thrones.
However, this actor, 31, with stereotypes of macho heroes, said that the role on the screen is often made young boys feel that they must be strong to respect.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that he's convinced he's wrong and wondering how to handle bad masculineity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed he felt 'strong enough' in discussing the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now-- where is our fault in this masculineity?' he said.
'What do we teach the men when they grow up, related to the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculineity with its very masculine characters.
He goes on to say: 'Where is the character since birth and what is taught?
What does it teach on TV, and on the street, which makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time-- how do we change it?
Because clearly there's something wrong with the young men.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in a foreman or a sequel to the Game of Thrones when this serial would end in the coming summer, saying that he's been 'selected with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will re-embrace True West from Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' her speech.
Rose played Ygritte, the character flower of the Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning series.
This couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's home land in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: Tiokkok reports 14% launching new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the population living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are infected in this country, says health officer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases were transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of Turkkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who had HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the Chinese health officer said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a acute problem in the T.L.B.P.T. community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is called more and more brandy.
Because of the conservative value of this country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many infectious diseases are associated with an improper sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters objected that staff had leaked Senator GOP's data, spread 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The representative of Maxine Waters on Saturday protested that one of his staff had sent three senators of the United States Republic Party to the Wikipedia page of the House of Representatives.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserts that the claim was prompted by experts and websites "ultra-right-wing".
"Talk, lie, and so on," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information released includes the home address and phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by people unknown to Capitol Hill in the Senate panel of the Senate on the allegations of improper sexual abuse of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the shipment are connected to the Waters office and revealing information from one of the Waters staff members, Hill reporting.
"This claim isn't really wrong and it's a total lie," continues Waters.
"My staff members - who are identity, personal information, and their safety are threatened by the charges of deception and error - are totally irresponsible of this information leak.
This is not a false accusation."
Waters quickly attracts online criticism, including the former Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This mess means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a member of Congress.
Nothing is to be done for him.
They should not deviate.
They don't question the motive of the constable.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the congregation on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the candidate of the Republican party who was trying to move Waters on the part-time election, also conveys his thinking on Twitter.
"Even if it's true," it says on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "right authority and the law enforcement entity about this wrong accusation.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed," and further, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strings Again - Atkinson's spy parody is not good
Now looking for Brexit meaning in every new film with an old English perspective has become a tradition and it seems to apply to the re-emergence of the Johnny English paráliadios daga-commedidio Johnny - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the syndicate sarcasm be about how bad we are being a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes are soaking, rubber-faced, and incompetence has renewed his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name gives more guidance than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for the foreign - English - speaking cinema area.
Surely he was a crazy secret agent who, apart from his strange guess, had a little clouseau character, a suit of character Mr. Bean and a traveler's century that contributed a little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
In fact, he is based on the international mystery man Atkinson played on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the mess behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I love it when Johnny English approached a helicopter with a mid-century zirth dress and slenders of the rotor with a quick grip on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy was shown, but his humor was less powerful and too strange, especially when branding a "serious" film like 007 and Mission It was impossible to believe in entering a comedian as a material.
It feels like it's meant for children from adults, and for me it's a strange Johnny English offense that's not innovative and a focus on Atkinson-film jokes in Bean's personality.
A prize that's been warming up for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint an active agent -- unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has completely destroyed his population politically: Emma Thompson played very well with the almost-Teresa-May character but not much of the script.
The smart counseler provided information that because every active spy had been crushed, he had to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English's own knuckleman, now employed as head of school in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to do the undercover operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and rejoined with an old friend who had been suffering from Bough, accompanied by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, instigating a submarine commander, the high-class role that sucks in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little out of sight.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake to Your Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, met a beautiful mysterious lady Ophelia Bulletova that Olga Kurylenko had.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is concerned about falling into the influence of a millionaire charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve the English computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventure: disguised as a waiter, they burned the fast French savanna; they made a mess by smuggled themselves over the fancy ship of Volta; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use the headset Virtual Reality to get used to the inside of the Volta house.
All arrests would have been pulled for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and merriment, there's a little children's TV channel that's all about it.
That's pretty moderate.
And like any other Johnny English film, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
Men objecting to plans for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the workers ’ union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
It was reported that the owners of the company would like to continue processing through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional days off.
He'll let employees enjoy the weekend of three days - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and plans push the country to support workers.
The fourth day of the week was approved by the British Congress as a way for workers to taste the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Workers' Union, told The Sunday Times: 'The expectation of this policy will be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but four days' a week's work is an aspiration that matches the party approach in order to reassess the economy that supports workers and the party's industrial strategy as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week at the 2017 public election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Men's Party says, 'On a weekly working day, it's not party policy and it's not being considered by the parties.'
Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a social revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "anonymous directive" and the "patterns" at the utility company.
The plan of this shadow chancellor also means that the current shareholders in the drinking water company may not be able to get the whole stock back because the government of the workers' party can do "overs" on the grounds of a perceived violation.
He also made sure that his plan to put workers in the company board and to create the Inclusive Ownership Fund would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would bend the annual dividend to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their view.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his pursuit at the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the findings of this office could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview given on Sunday, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republican Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charges appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, firm, firm man."
It seems, however, Graham's voice cannot be changed.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett's fighting him hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name can't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I didn't see any new changes."
What does the Global Citizen Festival mean, and has this event done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that displays the star's rites that are very impressively performed, and a mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of this event is to end the extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was a continuation of Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay VIP tickets), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a right way to invite people to do something, or just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that over 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters, prompting them to set other goals.
It has been said that this action has helped launch world leaders to announce a commitment and policy equal to more than $37 billion that would affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group had gathered 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been postponed or funded.
This group estimates that the security fund has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments, among others, The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership composed of investors and perpetrators committed to "help the children grow to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the lack of nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, the fosterers, the national governments, and the Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustices about these deficiencies as a landmark record in history," ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were performed to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on the Public Answer on their websites that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global scientist answers: "This will be a long and difficult road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheids that were before us, we're gonna make it, because if we're united we're going to be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that are performing on this year's show in New York, which will be driven by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "block" to curb the export of Russia's energy - State Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could call for help from the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as stated by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believes that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation - is a move to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy makers, just like they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lane is open, and, if necessary, to do a blockade, to make sure that their energy can't get into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the events held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nirlaba group that called himself an "energy customer's voice" in the United States.
He compared the approach Washington made in a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is less, using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with the economy that depends on fossil fuel.
This statement appeared when Trump's government's representative was doing a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump government officials, including President AS Donald Trump himself, were trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "undeserved" oil pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "opportunity" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil mill project 2 is worth $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of oil mill pipelines up to 110 billion cubic feet of this, is pure economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's hard fight against this project is merely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made to exert pressure and that customers must be able to choose their own supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Alexandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This attitude has attracted the reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the energy policy of the European Union and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I'll face a big problem if the third country mixes up our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "see the situation" when running himself as President in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "observe the situation" while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning in the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in the top position," as she said to The Hill.
"On November 6th, I'll reflect the situation when running as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he campaigned in the city hall, saying that he "takes this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren was blaring in delivering his criticism of Trump and the Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we do a vote on it."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s constituents did not want him to run by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said it was best that the senator didn't run himself, according to Suffolk's opinion University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent that supports the caller.
The media showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run himself, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running himself and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cited PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a violent incident in the household on Monday night.
"What my son has experienced, what he will experience when he returns, I can connect with other families who also experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers have experienced," he said in front of those in attendance at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin refers to his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and tells of his son and other veterans, "they return with a little different, they come back harder, they come back and wonder if there's any respect for what they've given, their fellow soldiers and the pilots and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus a report on domestic violence and possession of drunk weapons, according to And Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the challenge of the new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The representative of 18 states and the district filed friends-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers against the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by American Civil Liberties Union in August against undeclared federal policy.
He said his partner "and his son was a violent gang member," had harassed him, but the U.S. officials refused his request for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a massive amount of asylum seekers for the United States, as countries that face major gang problems and domestic violence.
The US's new policy of asylum is behind the 2014 Immigrant Council's decision to allow black immigrants to escape from domestic violence to present asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "implys the law of state, federal, and international that has been in existence for decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibitions as they violate the principle," the friend-of-the short brief said.
Further prosecutors give a brief opinion that the policy that refuses access to immigrants is damaging the U.S. economy, saying that they are likely to be entrepreneurs and "promoting the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to no longer give relief to victims who fled the domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"They are available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
It's not meant to relieve all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
It's a very sad rescue effort on the tree because the victim doubles when running in time to find the survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very anxious," says Kusuma's Risa, a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy's son-in-law at the refugee center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
The people are looking back at their destroyed houses, taking watery things, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and cared for in the hospital, the damage caused by a 7.5 - powerful earthquake, was a mess.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractures of the back and shoulder bones, lying outside the Pallu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a strong earthquake.
His tears flowed as he told his feelings when the earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"I couldn't save myself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, he added that his family were in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then be quiet.
I don’t know what my daughter and I are feeling.
Hope they're safe."
Ambassador U.S. accused Tiokkok of 'intimacy' with 'a propaganda commercial'
One week after the official newspaper of Tiokkok contains four-page advertisements on a U.S. newspaper that mentions the profit of the U.S.-Tiogkok trade fair, the great U.S. ambassador to Tiokkok accuses Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
President AS Donald Trump on Wednesday who then referred to supplement pay China Daily in Des Moines Register - the best news newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing Tiok of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, an accusation by Tiokkok.
Trump's claim that Beijing's attempt to interfere in the U.S. elections, marking what the U.S. official said to Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of the campaign that Washington was doing to push up the Chinese.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to put advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in ever-increasing trade wars, which make them raise the import tariffs for each other.
The tax of revenge in China at the beginning of this trade war was designed to hit exporters in the states like Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, said experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former former governor, lead Iowa, the main exporter of farm items in China, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in the United States.
Tiokkok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now double the intimidation by running advertising on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government uses free speech and press freedom that is highly valued in America by loading a bill of lading in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Inversely, in the street newspaper news kiosks here in Beijing, you'll find a setback against different voices and not see a real reflection on the different views that the Chinese might have about the troubled Chinese economic route, considering the media under the control of the Communist Party of Tiokkok," he wrote.
He added that "one of the best-known media in China refuses to publish" his article, even though he doesn't mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republicans’ Party Keep Women Off Elections for Part-Time Elections With the Disasters of Kavanaugh
Because of the fact that the important people in the Republican Party stand up and defend the leadership of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in facing some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see the attack back, especially from women, on a public half-time election that will come.
The emotion over this problem is very high, and most members of the Republican Party have been reported to have shown that they want to advance on the vote.
It can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the desire of the Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake in the final minutes to do the FBI investigation would be enough to dispel the anger of the elector.
"Wanita won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn said it on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they took a demonstration at the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue progressing in the Kavanaugh prosecution, regardless of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," non party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and that's right.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voice pickers in the farthest regions and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who because they don't like the president, often don't give the voice."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, who described in detail sexual harassment against himself by the Supreme Court's leadership, analysts would advise a further attack if the Republican Party continued to push him forward with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former former head of the Republican Party Committee, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the backup bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this problem and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, the director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be breaking up about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more decisive choice to the last.
A new voice mail from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or might believe in Ford testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or might believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or might actually lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's encouragement, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and one of the other drivers, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's ruling candidate showed him his pity when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inviter is Planning to Start the New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that was trying to trace Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the legend of this technology, Inrut, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrut is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "private online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage may contain a list of contacts, a list of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify that everything is available on one browser and everything at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
At the company known as "personal assets through data."
The idea of establishing Inrut, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is for the company to supply resources, processes, and skills that are appropriate to help Solid be available to everyone.
Now this company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted staff developers to work on the project, and the volunteer code-making community.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can make their own demoralization applications using tools available on the Inrut web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether it would introduce or not a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed last night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."

Bernard Vann: acknowledging WW1 Victoria Cross
The only church in England that won Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, remembered on his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was provided by his two grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "intelligence symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of grandpa's achievement won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "to cross the thick fog under the truce of fire from field weapons and machines."
Then he hurried forward to the battle line and with the "best bravery" leading the front line before rushing using the field weapons alone and crippling three deteases.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, also put on a flowering assignment after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to play a part in this parade" and added "the bravery of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been up all night to watch the 206 Bellator full of shit just to refuse to watch the main show.
San Jose's bills contain 13 fights, including six on the main card and are being displayed directly throughout the night in Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other, an audience in England was struck when his neck was turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they are engaged until early in the special day for the fight.
A Twitter fan describes the replacement to a children's cartoon film as "a disgusting joke."
"This is a government rule, that at 6 a.m. the contents are not suitable for being held, so replaced by a child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa and pigs," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd fix their schedules by counting on the audience in England in the future.
"According to me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But now there's six o'clock in the morning on Sundays and we won't be able to fix it until we're on Sundays, on Mondays their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of the replacement, a lot of text back and forth and everything doesn't educate.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce up to five fights of just six fights - as we used to do - and we're going to try to avoid overdrinking for fans, and we're doing it.
It's an unprofitable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "low self" related to sexual issues
Tom Daley's Olympic divers said he grew up in low self-esteem because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old guy said he didn't realize it until he went to middle school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said, he's talking about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent doesn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
It's the usual show that's been running this long, Kirsty Young, taking a few months' leave of illness.
Apparently as the people who were excluded from Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than all the others who grew up with him because "not the things that can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, "Until today, it is a feeling that is less than that of others, and a feeling that is clear to me, that gives me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they knew about his sexuality.
The two Olympic bronze medalists have become the leading LGBT campaigner and use his performance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He says he's talking because he's lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he was in love with a man-made film from the US Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013 - "surprise me."
Daley was married to Oscar's husband, who was 20 years older than he was in the past, and he said agelessness was not a problem.
"If you had so many problems at a very young age"--he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had the same growth rate.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything around 'I have to win the gold medal," she said.
"You know, there's something bigger than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already got tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of Dad," she said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was undefeated," he said.
The next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"What I know is, this is what I've dreamed of throughout my life--to dive in front of the crowd of people in the Olympics, there's no feeling better than that," she said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still made him laugh.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when offered to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Pegolf America Phil Miccelson will record a record on Sundays when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he had to change the role of avoiding unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played on two-year shows to record a 12-time record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and the fourth group on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the top winner five times this splits the time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on the scale, hoping to fix what has made it hard.
Never become the most straightest golfer, even though it's at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man doesn't fit to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Miccelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the open British champion who was very accurate Francesco Molinari, who had worked with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single matches with four points below, it starts with a hot start, then the Micchelson match is proven to be very important.
Furyk expressed his confidence to this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understood his role today, clapped my back and hugged me, and said he'd be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He's Hall of Famer and he's given so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's the way they play, and that's the way we think we have to go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people do."
Miccelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career on Ryder Cup that will never match his individual record heights.
Mickelson counted 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be told on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he likes to mock people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said to explain.
"I think younger players have fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He's given more than just to play."
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows great excellence could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone who led big enough to his last single game at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding the top five points above America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinst edge, won 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we have great excellence in Valderrama; we have great excellence in Brookline, where we have lost, and in Valderrama, where we have won, but just," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, won 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday with 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focused on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the world's greatest players."
It's nice to see players playing in the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never make my own progress.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a partner if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ask his player to play better individually than they do as a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of the last day's big game, has been part of the team that won at Brookline before it ended with defeat when Europe did "Wise in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said to answer the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment walks one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to take the lead in the fight against Rory McIllroy in the uppermost match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the uppermost order.
"I went with a bunch of these guys in order like this because I felt I could close all the streets," Bjorn said about his single choice.
The new German warship was postponed
The latest German Navy ship was supposed to have started in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but the ship would not be there until the next year because of its increased system and cost, the local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, has now been postponed until the first part of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting the military speaker.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the delivery issue had disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that had been commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come in exchange for the old Bremen-class patrol.
This ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-fly missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as a number of animal technologies, such as radar removals, infrareds, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include a longer period of treatment - should be allowed to use the latest ship guards for two years away from the harbor.
However, the ongoing delay means that this advanced warship - which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - will be obsolete as it begins to enter its period of duty, Die Zeit notes.
The bad fateful F125 ship had become a announcement last year, when the German Navy officially refused to ship the ship and returned it to the hull of the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipmaker after the shipment.
Only a few of the reasons are known to be behind the ship's return, but the German media cites a number of important "software and hardware" devices that make the warship useless if used for the battle mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the labor force on the older Bremen class warship.
It is also known that the ship's boat is very much overpowered to reduce its performance and limit the capacity of the Navy to add to the latest upgrades.
"Rheinland-Phalz" with this 7,000-ton bot is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to a broken hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also a problem.
It was said to rise surprisingly to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - to rise from the beginning €2.2 billion.
The issue that envelops these new ships is of great importance in the light of the recent warning of the abduction of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "exhausted ship with the ability to spread."
The official says as time goes on, because old ships are no longer in use but no replacement ships are provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats secretly
New research is being done on a farm on the Highland of Scotland, which aims to reveal how bats use natural branches in their food hunts.
Hopefully this discovery will provide new light on this unique flying mammalian behavior and help guide conservation activity in the near future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the general pipistrelle and sopran as well as long - eared chocolate bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a cell survey using a gang detector.
Sound experts analyzing all recordings will ensure frequency of bat calls and species that perform what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports would be designed to draw pictures of the scale of nature's borders detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor for the NTS, hoping this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management jobs such as grassland production and the best way to maintain the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England have declined sharply in the last few centuries.
This is threatened by the construction and development work that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to lure bats and chemical care of buildings, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
Yet, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using advanced echo location techniques to find insects accurately and hinders on their flying pathways.
The NTS, which is responsible for taking care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is of great concern to bats.
Have ten trained workers, who regularly conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes try to rescue them.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural shells in Scotland in the Threve farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager said the farm was the right area for bats.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of bat testing before taking care of the property, because there is no doubt that the destruction of a breeding nest could kill up to 400 female and small bats, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, killed, harassed, or destroyed by the nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s office for the Kellawar Trust Conservation, has moved the public to help.
He said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don't know how their population ends."
Ronaldo, who rejects a rape claim, is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo refers to a claim of rape on him as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer would sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which imposed the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then expected to pay it by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a direct Instagram video to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo screamed the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," the winner Ballon d'Or five times this says to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call "a suspicion report in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "replace moral damages in the amount corresponding to the weight of the offense, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were re-reported to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped, according to a report filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The mayor said that Ronaldo kneeled after the incident was accused and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who failed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo claims that they both had sex, but that was on the basis of mutual desire.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had done a vision of his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to resolve the problem outside the court because he felt "fear would get revenge" and worried "will be shamed in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's been constantly traumatized by that incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: English "will regret forever" the loss of carmakers
England "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car producer after Brexit, says Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England had told BBC that if England left the European Union without a deal, for the time being it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border postponement if there was no agreement, would damage Brexit in terms of the cost of work.
The factory in Burnaston - which made the Toyota Auris and Adensis production - produced almost 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"My opinion is that if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the cessation of production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's execution in Burnaston.
Another British car producer has expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without a deal on how cross-border trade would go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for instance, said it would close the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the car manufacturers said was the risk of supply chains if there was no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production lines are run on the principle of "time" production, with every 37 minutes of good joints of English and European manufacturers for cars made according to order.
If England left the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance on the border, which industry believed could cause delays and lack of ties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to save more than a day's supplies at his factory in Derbyshire, the company's representation said, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says the Chequers Theresa May plan to connect with the European Union in the future is "an accurate calibration to avoid border inspection."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 program today.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also the other producers, that we really should be able to continue what has become a chain of supply that has been very good."
Toyota can't tell how long its production would stop, but clearly in the long run, warning that the cost increases will reduce the plant's salting capacity and eventually damage the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Union at the factory, says that his member has become more concerned: "As my experience, as soon as this job goes off, it will never come back.
Government speakers said, "We've put forward the right plan and made sense for our relationship with the European Union in time to come."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be back delayed, White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the senior deputy mayor Rod Rosenstein could be "released another week" because the high court leader Brett Kavanaugh is still on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference of Russia in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia’s assistants, and the potential that hinders justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a high-ranking deputy, who will jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been triggering gossip in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record a conversation with Trump and was likely to smuggle the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose to no" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was rescheduled to avoid a meeting with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's claim, which was due to delay the full vote of the Senate.
Secretary of the Trump Press, Sarah Sanders, performs on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date for the meeting was not set, it could be this week, I can see that it was good to postpone it to another week, too, considering the other things that happened at the high court.
But let's just see and I've always wanted to share the latest news with the press."
Some journalists will be against that statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The carrier of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders said that the meeting was seldom because it was not like TV reporters "who were trying to draw attention," though, he said, "I disagree with the fact that they were trying to draw attention."
Then he proposed direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president did more questions directly than the previous president," he said without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still be, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying more often to do it and you've seen a lot of us do it in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asks when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
Solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president might show us why, doing a free and sometimes weird look before the reporters gather.
Health Secretary wrote a letter to the workers of the European Union at NHS Scotland on concern about Brexit's problem
Secretary of Health has written a letter to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the state and hope that they will still work here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England drew itself from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed itself to meet the regular status costs of EU citizens working in public services transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between England and the European Union on this withdrawal are still continuing, approaching the decision expected at this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for possible scenarios with no agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That is why I now want to reaffirm how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, carry valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and enhance health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was conducting an emergency operation after suffering head injury
Behind Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodoros on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Head Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured reporters shortly before the deal was over.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel give Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it in the backyard and bringing it to further assessment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at Vanderbilt's Medical Center.
Harris adds that "there's no more detail about the kind of injury suffered" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this two-layered student, was in his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five teats on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made the total teats throughout this season 18 teats.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher than the cost of buying properties in England
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material when they buy properties in England, along with extra money that will be used to help the homeless according to new plans Tory
This step will halt Corbyn's success rate in attracting young voters
The cost of this material will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance is forecast to collect up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be put on higher standards when they buy properties in England - and extra money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to curb the success rate of efforts by Jeremy Corbyn in attracting young people with promises to provide more affordable housing and high incomes.
The cost of materials will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that encourages the government’s efforts to fight a ban.
Additional costs - which are additional costs on the current cost of materials, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on the second house purchase and the home purchase to be rented - up to three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It was estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties were purchased by non-English citizens, which caused price increases and made it harder for the first buyer to set foot on the residential stairs.
Many rich regions in this country - usually in the capital city - have become "ghost cities" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes out only a week after Boris Johnson calls for cutting the material costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the price of a permanent property by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for the homes that were reached to improve the "hospital housing" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent surveillance and ending "no guilt".
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last I promised I would dedicate the Prime Minister's office to restoring the English dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our homeless housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for corporations that are based abroad, to buy homes that are easy for the English people who have been working hard.
For many people dreams of having a home to be something very far away, and unspoiled behavior against a bum still is real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambience is leading the Scotland team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to be Scotland's manager on some steps.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently has third rank in League One, different from three points of top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to market my country as a player.
I got a B hat and it was him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watching Scotland's team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always becomes something interesting to me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former boss Alloa Athletic said he wasn't afraid to follow the tracks of big names in that big club, after he had previously turned down the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, today's success will be measured with 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, no doubt about being in the First League," he said.
"Don't be easy to be there, but I'll probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I can take this club back there."
Career Ross in the management of the team only three years, after some time as an assistant boss in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the bar of degradation into the winner of the championship title next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he's ever done during his career playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"This may be the intersection that I have to cross," she recalls when taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying a few things that are right.
But playing can be hard.
Many things you have to go through every week.
I'm still in work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life."

Survey found, the right time for a beer is 17.30 on Saturday.
Summer heat waves have increased the income of British pubs struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The numbers show, the pub and bar groups saw the rise in sales of 2.7 percent in July - but the revenue in the restaurant dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled those numbers, said: "The sun that shines hot and participates in England's World Cup longer than expected means, the month of July will follow the same pattern as the previous month, where the income of the pub increases by 2.8 percent, except the restaurant that gets a hard hit.
The drop in restaurant trade is 1.8 percent in June is going to get worse in July.
The sales of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far are more powerful than the ones that happen at the restaurant that comes down.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, even though the restaurant operator is not separated.
Looks like people just out for a drink.
Selling all over the pubs and bars that sell drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, by selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, a recreation analyst and a RSM hotel, says: "This is the success of the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the impact of large sports or social events remain the biggest factor in the sale of markets outside the home.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although the decrease in sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long summer should not come when the operator sells food has a bad time, and time will tell us if the temperature is good enough for us to enjoy in August will give us a little rest."
Total sales growth in the entire pub and restaurant, including the newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the bridge on the launch of the brand.

One of five children has a secret social media account that they're hiding from their parents.
Survey revealed, one in five - some of them still 11 - have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
Survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the development of "False Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "especially" account to show the parents
One of five children -- some of them still 11 years old -- makes social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
Survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the rapid development of the "False Insta" account - a reference to the photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they operate the "mainly" account that has been cleared to be shown to the parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked someone else for "my rape."
Research carried out by the British Digital Awareness and the Men's Head of School Conference" and the Head of School of Women" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
Chief HMC, Mike Buchanan said: "This is so disturbing many teenagers who try to create online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be a voice for athletes in the Scottish Atlantic Council
Eilidh Doyle has been chosen to join the Scottish Atlantic Council as a non-executive director at the annual annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is a track athlete and a Scotland field that is the most marked of honor and Ian Beattie's leader describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sports field to benefit from various international experiences over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice to the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
America's athletic athlete, who won 200 meters and 400 feet on the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, is among the total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, cannot now walk after a moment's ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I suffered from stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said it was only a time to determine if I could recover back to the level of recovery.
It's like a very exhausting job to recover completely, learn how to walk back, and today do some practice!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The advertising of breast pumps comparing mother to cows has split the world's views online
The breast pump company has diverged opinions in the world online with an advertisement that compares mother to grieving cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "the breast pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," Elvie's consumer technology company released an advertisement inspired by the video music of the genius to show the freedom this new pump gave to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the barn with a cow straw following a song that reads like this: "Yes, I'm bleeding myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice it's not ambiguing, this is my breast."
It goes on to refrain: "Pumpa out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman."
However, the advertisements published on this company’s Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a wide-ranging reaction from the viewers, with many who say this causes "worship" in the milk industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows must also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except for their baby stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," wrote one.

Another comment: "Trauma can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise the breast pump for the mother to keep her baby?"
The others add: "A missing commercial."
Someone else defended the commercial, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I still nurse it.
Meeras make me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial was kind of crazy, but I took it for granted.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
Others comment: "This is a pleasant commercial for mothers who blackmail (often in their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "breed."
"It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps stuck in their arms.
The basic concept of the campaign comes from the insight of many women who are extorting ASI who say they feel like cows.
But Elvie Pump is really hening, without wires or tubes and passes in the bra sucking, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out blackmailing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is a product worthy of launch with convincing and provocative.
Comparing the image between expressing our women and our golden cow want to pump the ASI and all obstacles to its challenge, and showing it through the way of comfort and fun with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has become the main news.

Hundreds of Migran Children Move Silence to the Tent Camp in the Texas Border
The number of migrant children being held is increasing even though the crossing of the moon's border remains unchanged, as a result of some of the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that makes it difficult for children to be cared for by sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear that they will jeopardize their own ability to stay in that country by moving forward to save the children.
Risk is rising in June, when the federal government announces that future sponsors and other adult members of their household have to deliver fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of immigration and Bea Cukai, testified to Congress that the institution had captured dozens of people who applied to support children under the age of youth.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested didn't have a record of criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who become sponsors or members of sponsoring groups are illegally in this country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
So we keep hunting for them, Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children more quickly, the officials introduce new rules that require some of them to attend court within one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which became previous standards, the rules of the shelter workers.
Most of them performed through video conference calls, not directly, to apply their legal status to immigration judges.
Those considered unworthy of getting help would be deported directly.
The longer the children are arrested, the more likely they are to become more anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape efforts, workers' talks and system reports received in the last few months.
The lawyers say that the concern is increasing in a larger facility like Tornillo, which signs exist in a child struggling to tend to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the camp town without making enough time for them emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can make a lot of trauma worse.
Syria asked the U.S., French and Turkish forces to immediately retreat
Speakers in the UN General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the country's war had now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister's deputy, said that foreign forces occupied Syria illegally, for reasons of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with with in due course."
"They must withdraw as soon as possible and without applying any conditions," he said to the council.
Moualem asserts that "war against terror is almost finished" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million escaped from their homes.
He asserted that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we cleaned up all Syria's territory" from the terror group and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially training and affecting Kurds and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war - torn territory.
With regard to refugee issues, Moualem stressed that they should return immediately, and he blamed "a number of western countries" for "declaring extraordinary fear" that spurred refugees to move away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organization to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize what should be the problem of humanity entirely."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until it agreed to the political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the grave of the last Idlib rebellion has given rise to an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents major attacks by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem asserts that it has a "clear time frame" and induces that military action will target the Mujahids include fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which will "punish."
UN Command Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to make the post-war invitation to Syria and open the way to public elections.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's membership on the committee, asserting that the panel's work must be restricted "to review the latest Undang-Undang chapters," and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020, except for many liberals hoping, prosecutions and scandals will soon end his presidency.
No doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there are no signs of weariness for the audience.
Since 2014, the CNN's main hour rating has increased more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost three times as 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main-time viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has been sitting at the top of cable TV with a total of 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is a spirit that makes people interested in being something they don't understand," said Neal Baer, an ABC drama player "Designed Survival," about the cabinet secretary who became president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking Into Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembered riding a cab in Boston before the general election in 2016.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
We see the value of entertainment in this mess.
Of course, unlike any other TV event, the background of the story from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can rejoin and restore global economics.
On top of that, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, not just being a citizen of the six-hour-old nation you found yourself witnessing panel experts discussing the use of the "back" source Bob Woodward for his book entitled "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's camel's leather jacket worth $15,000 ("the thick clothes with pride," The Washington Post) and the involvement of Stormy Daniels' terrible description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"Despite the policy he does make it the same as a real event that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performance player and the daily Trump story (chooses against NFL, commends Kim Jong-un).

He couldn't free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and the next Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we had all the crazy shows on that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

Lots of money from outside flood the most severe part-time election competition in the White House
Pennsylvania 17 had a cash flood, thanks to the re-enactment of the district of congress that offered two years in the same chair.
Recently re-established Pittsburg District, filed Conor Lamb of Rep. Democrat - which won a seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb progresses against other nationalities, Keith Rothfus Republic, now representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were resettled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally taking sides on the Republican party.
The competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in large funding for the campaign between the financial side of the major party, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in March's special election that was widely watched for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
The seat has been occupied by the Office of the Republic’s Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political experts send the Democratic party a little higher.
The U.S. is counting on the punishment of El Salvador for supporting Tiokkok, then back off.
The diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
The Office of the Foreign Department decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "new decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department speaker, appeared in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who had received help at about $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support and economic support.
The proposed punishment, which includes the cancellation of the targeted visas and visas, will damage the Central American state and increase its unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting took place, the North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in the mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted further conference, in order to be effective in finalizing the trial for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for the mid-October, as an import signal that the government made at the meeting, enclosing the diplomats.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reproofs or harsh sentences from Washington.
A White House speaker for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate put forward by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal views of this unclear state.
Their statements were reinforced by a close-to-government external analyst and also talked about this unclear situation.
Study Story
Another surprising story is a report by special advisor Robert Mueller on the possibility of the trial of Mr. Trump, who is currently having very important evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also examined whether Trump's campaign was colluding with Russia in attacking our public election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the electors, and may eventually become judges of his partners.
So there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Lord Trump's government cannot be avoided - or his equality in Europe.
There's a better choice we make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only west against him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed a chance to avoid the next years of massacre.
The beginning of history was centered on all such intersections, and the fast - paced or postponed democracy was inevitable.
Now Americans face a few points of this change.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person watching the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reported that, last year, he recommended that the president be kept secret and held that he was not worthy of office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times accounts were not true.
"How do we respond if the recent F.B.I. investigation asked by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair--or if he was brought to the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress that will call for Trump's accountability?
If we fail to pass the test, democracy will only get worse in a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once lived in my large embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candles on a table containing swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feel optimistic about fighting Rapid Vienna
Rangers saw Rapid Vienna on Thursday, victory over Austria, following good developments in Spain against Villarreal early this month, will strengthen their position to escape from the European G League Group.
The knee injuries made the mid-brows Graham Dorrans could not perform in the first season until the result 2-2 against Villarreal, but he was sure that the Rangers could use the result as a rock pajamas toward the larger one.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal was a great team," the 31-year-old player.
"In this game, we're sure we can get something and go by bending one point.
In the end, we might be able to do that, but we believe, the results may be fair.
In the first round, they might do better but in the second round, we woke up and became a better team.
Starting on Thursday, tonight is another European big day.
We hope to be able to count three points even though it will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last match, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can go on and get positive results.
In the past year, we had a difficult time, because what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
It's a good squad and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good practice.
Hopefully now we can grow, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few were discussing it with their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discussed the long-term care costs with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they were discussing this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nation's life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don't tell your wishes first.
Language with counsel and your family, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean a lot to determine the cost.
Place your financial advisors: Your advisors can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay those costs.
Your choice of long-term care includes traditional long-term care policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or assure yourself of your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face the legal debate that's in conflict.
The prompt direction to your health care is someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your desire is carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the letter of power in the matter of money should be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of every financial decision you have to choose, other than to make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot.
Always remember with every detail as little as any: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in emergency health and on their way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer questions about treatment and allergies?
Please note such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man hit the wind rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a party at night.
The 40-year-old victim is in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots about the chest, the stomach, and his hands.
The shooting event was described by the officer was about 02:30 BST, and it was said to be "scanning."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries the victim suffered did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses had been submitted by the police.
An earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia.
Earthquakes and tsunamis were so devastating that the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, had wiped out a small number of 384 souls, the officers ’ arrests, and the number of dead victims was expected to increase.
It cut off the communication and made the officers of the difficult aid to obtain information from the Domgala Regiment, a region on the north side of the Pale town that was closer to the earthquake center that hit the Richter’s 7.5-scale power.
In Palu, after a disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below this is a number of major facts about the towns of Palu and Donggana, on the island of Sulawesi:
The capital of the Central Sulawesi province, is located on the narrow edge of the western shore of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
At the same time, it was an area of over 300 km (180 km) from the coast line in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is the administrative area below the province, is estimated to have 299,200 lives in 2017.
The main economic eyes in the South Sulawesi province are looking for fish and crop-hunting, especially on the coast of Donggana.
However, the development of nickel is also important in this province, although most of it is centered in Morrowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
It's been recorded in the last 100 years, Pallus and Donggana have been hit several times by a tsunami, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Exploitation Board.
In 1938, over 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes at Domuala.
In 1996, nine people died of a tsunami disaster in western Donggana.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Chain and because of the earthquakes that will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of earthquakes and tsunamis that have plagued the last few years are as follows:
2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake on the western coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, to the point of eliminating 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half the dead victims were in Aceh.
In 2005: Late March and early April, a series of devastating earthquakes struck Sumatra in the west.
Hundreds of people are killed on the island of Nias, on the shore of Sumatra.
The year 2006: A 6.8 - violent earthquake struck southern Java, the most dense island in Indonesia, resulting in tsunamis on the south coast and nearly 700 deaths.
The year 2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The victim died more than 1,100 people.
The year 2010: An island on the island of Menauai, upon Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, triggering a tsunami of some 20 feet [10 m] in length, which eventually took up dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's Regency, Aceh, also had a shallow earthquake and resulted in the destruction, as well as the panic of people who were reminded of the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami that died in 2004.
Although tsunamis did not take place this time, over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, called the tourist island, also suffered a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which were on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake swept down thousands of buildings and while engulfed thousands of tourists.
The firstborn son Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice president's candidate, has been arrested for the attack.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, prevented reports of domestic violence and against arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaskan State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she seized the woman's phone.
Palin was handed over to the custody of the court of Mat-Su, with a fine of $500 without guarantee, as reported by the U.S.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, said he was "innocent, sure" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three Class A minor offenses, which could have him sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was charged with a class B criminal charge, with one day's sentence and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, criminal charges are not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to make a report on the alleged attack.
Now the case is filed with the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence, and possession of firearms intoxicated, which also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of staring at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was threatened by an emerging vector group to link his son's violence with PTSD as a result of his duties during Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, until at least 384 people died.
The 7.5 - scale earthquake of Richter’s powerful tsunamis has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are cut short, and death rates are forecast to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake at that time hit the middle of Sulawesi, which is located in the east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The video shows how widespread the moment of the disaster is throughout the social media.
Hundreds of the people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the town of Palu at that time, when the tsunami broke up the beach.
The federal prosecutor attempted a death sentence that rarely occurred to a terrorist suspect in NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York attempted a death sentence for Sayfulllo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the punishment included rare and had not been carried out in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to undertake an attack by crashing the truck he rented from Home Depot to a pedestrian and a bike driver on the bike route along West Side Highway at Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "in an intentional manner" killed the eight victims and "in an intentional manner" caused serious bodily injury, on the basis of a statement of intent to bring down the death penalty, which was filed in the New York South District.
On the basis of the court's documents, the two charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury imprisoned Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in the prosecution of acts of indignation, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and attempted motor vehicle damage.
According to prosecutors, the attack requires "substantial planning and initial termination," as the description of Saipov's crime done with "dangerous, cruel, and barbaric."
It was revealed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and lost against family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims at the incident are tourists from Argentina.
Counted a decade since the New York South District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, a defendant indicted for the murder of two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The final execution of the death penalty in the federal court of New York in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty in the spy conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, does not show regret as it goes on days and months after the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said that he was happy with what he had done, to arrest the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video from his phone, as it was in the indictment.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be put in his hospital room, after the police.
He said he was innocent over 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal generals representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" to the prosecution decision.
"We are told, the decision to execute death rather than to accept a sentence for life imprisonment without bail will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
In the past, Saipov's defense team had applied to the prosecutor to refrain from bringing down the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for the Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage calls for 'pourishing the people' today in protests at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should be 'heating' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggests to join in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that England 'should be out' today if only Farage served as Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenges that May faces in the reconciliation of his shared position have been beset by supporters of Remain Tories who joined in separate protests threatened Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to defend his plans to compromise his Chequers to stay on track even in the middle of the Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stressed that he would be moved to advance to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he had a bad reaction - and forced the Eurosceptics and the labourer to determine a choice between his claim packages and the "disruption".
Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted' to get rid of the Chequers.
The result is that Farage has to appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the manager stays with him, we'll be out now," he says.
Parliamentarian Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up to support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Checkers."
He said, "We have not fought in the world war in order to bow down.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone added the suggestion that the public opinion might change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the English people's thinking has changed and wants the conditions, that's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, put it to the press: 'Simple, I want to say, 'O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Checkers aren't popular in the public, while Opposition won't pick it, because it's not popular with our parties and our activists who really get down to the street and make us elected in the first position.
Our petition, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when their promises are fulfilled."
Farage said that the political demonstration had to be thwarted so that it could be 'heated' if they wanted to reject the 2016 referendum decision.
‘This most precious moment is the trust between us people and our political groups,’ he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we will not escape you to do that'.'
He added in a message to the crowds of enthusiastic people: 'I want you to make our political group, who are preparing to reject Brexit, also feel the heat.
“ We are moving the citizens of this country to win us over to Brexit and will never give up until the United Kingdom is its own, its own government and its own pride. ”
In the meantime, the Remainers mass moves through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
The active line seems to spread the Tories Against Brexit's banner after the start of the line at the end of this week.
Companions in the Labour line, Lord Adonis, are making fun of the Conservative group on the security issue of their party's application when the conference is opened.
"These are the people who told us that they could master the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-drug border, in an endless free trade in Ireland," he healed.
‘ It is really a play.
There's no good Brexit at all,' he healed.
Warren's planning on a serious strike in the president's coroner's seat
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he would "break the president's caller's seat" after the election moment in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future in the city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.

Ajang Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after a team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It's all clear when Valtteri Bottas is in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifier line on Saturday that will bring the Mercedes team's orders have a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton because he held his position in the first round of the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into the pit and let Hamilton move into the bends at the end of the crowd, something that should be very definite.
Mercedes entered pit one lap after and left after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to travel after some of the chasing actions that showed the resistance of Ferrari drivers left the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off in the back of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most races because he held the tire shift to target quick resolution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth position.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th but couldn't raise his step in the eight remaining laps because finally Raikkonen took the fourth position.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job the whole weekend and a real man who let me.
Team has done an amazing job to have two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein in a religio on Saturday through his village, he didn't issue a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on the sexual assault on Judge Great Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking in a relic in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement by Ford before the Senate's Court Committee, instead of commenting on what is going on in the senate that shows people that "bad and ugly and dishonest."
"Something can happen and the beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and obscene and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the amps and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein has sent a letter outlining the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July last, and it has leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leaks did not come from his office.
"I didn't hide the charge of Dr. Ford's, I didn't leak the story," said Feinstein to the committee, delivered Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as secret as he asked."
But his rejection seemed to be disapproved by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president was impressed to assume that democracy used accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, greed, they don't care who they hurt, what they have to walk for power and supervision," mediaite report on the president's speech.

The Air Traffic Driver Dies to Set Up Counts of Passengers on a Safe Air Force of Storms
An air traffic guide in Indonesia was lured as a hero after his death when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The earthquake continued to shake the region and many were trapped in ruins in the town of Palu.
But as soon as his companions fled for their safety, 21-year-old man Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his post in a heavily rocked guide tower in Sis Al Jufri Highland, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure the 6321 Baltic Air Flight which at that time was on the runway, can safely take off.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower when he felt the tower began to collapse.
He died after he was in the hospital.
The speaker of the Indonesian Flight Navigation Service Agency, Yohannes Sirait, made his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from Australia's ABC news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpan in California to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worry about the death of the victims can reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Board makes access to the city of Dongga, Sigi, and Boutong difficult.
"The body is believed to continue to grow because of the many bodies of victims that are still torn apart and many others that cannot be reached," said the national body disaster relief expert Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave of up to six meters has made the upper pole that causes mass burial on Sunday.

Clean water becomes rare.
Minimarkets everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it may get worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all duties related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia at the beginning of this year was also hit by an earthquake in the Lombo that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian Airborne Accident: One person lost after a lagoon plane accident
The airline operated a flight that fell to the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, delivering one person had disappeared, after prior delivery to 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
The river Niumini delivered on a release on Saturday afternoon, but it was unable to identify a passenger.
The experts said his side had been working with the local authorities, the hospital and the examiner to find the man.
The experts are not quick to respond to the demand for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after the aircraft hit the water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
The officer announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The experts delivered six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable condition.
What causes an accident and a complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. experts and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed on the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses feel that the plane is beyond the runway.
American passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really something good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him and the others managed to run through the high-pitched water through the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He's talking to the freaking and screaming people, and he's having a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired docks also helped rescue by using rubber boats to transport people to the land before the plane sinks at about 30 meters (100 ft) in the water.

Analysis of the US Justice Department Paul Rowlett's testimony for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a huge line for the jury about how he used his cell phone footage to collect movements carried out by the defendant at 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the reverse of the previous defendant's statement, as Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was at one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other inconsistencies that Tellis presented were his statements that he knew Chambers for about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate that they know each other in a one-week run.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, Tellis sometimes deleted messages, calls and contact Chambers information from her phone.
"He wiped the victim out of his life," said Hale.
It's scheduled to start the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge stated that he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.

The other black people?!
NY nanny demanded a couple because they attacked after sending a message of "realism"
A New York nanny demanded one couple because they had attacked discriminally after receiving an indirect message from a supportive mother saying that she was "the other black."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and considered it more like "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed anxiety when she realized that the new care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black as soon as she was on her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't think that anyone else is," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Miss Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they were taking out the nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because he had done an ugly job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then returned to Uber.
At this point, Maurice demanded that the couple give compensation for the cancellation, and asked for compensation for about $350 a day for the six-month term, in return for the loss of the nanny's work that he had to work at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do something like that," she said to the Post on Sunday, then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple opposed the claim that they claim to be racial, that workers who were fired from Maurice were justified in doing so, they were worried that they could not believe it after they offended him.
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As if wrapped in "expression," his wife Plasco said, "only two months of giving birth to his baby and being in a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone in such a state?
That's not a good thing to do," investment bank added.
As the legal case is still under way, the court of general opinion has made rapid complaints against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
Paddington's publisher worried the reader wouldn't have anything to do with the bear talking, the new newspaper was revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book had been received, was explained in a letter.
Very funny to know how we know about the great achievement of Paddington."
Says his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through child book writing with a bear toy, who would be very optimistic of his work that he had been denied, he added the anniversary of publishing books that the '60s felt "sweet" after his father died last year.
For Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud of his final success.
"He's a quiet enough man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington means a lot to him, it's like you have a child who's got something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he was always praising his own Paddington."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors had failed to save her.
"Nad made the call calmly to convey it really bad. That he's very likely not going to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from the Nad who said he would die within two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors have given them to keep their heart steady and slow to wreak out and leave their system.
He's died a few moments of treatment and everything feels like it's dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't moan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with the other passengers - unaware of what she had been through.
"No one knows," she said.
"My head is drenched and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but in that flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones were trying to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They used to say that the smile was exciting."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11 - year - old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any further effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can close and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up-- you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "That's a barrier in the family.
It's separating us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for--an investigation that's limited in time, limited in scope--we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake's study on Saturday, added that he feared the committee's "break" in the midst of the lack of a board's decision.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republic's supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their renegade is all due to time.
The legislative election is five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republic does it badly, they will become very weak in their opportunity to make the person they want to be elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meeting with Ashley his wife, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean drivers under Kim
The number of people who wandered from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-a ruling power seven years ago, in the course of a Korean parliament member.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of South Unity data, said there were 1,127 handlings last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border control between North Korea and China and the higher fares imposed by human smugglers were the key factors.
Pyongyang doesn't give a public comment.
Most of the Northerners were finally offered a South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which had the longest border with North Korea and were easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
The Turks treat smugglers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often force them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still in war - has been increasing dramatically in the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the two country leaders met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the late negotiations of the negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for lack of progress ever since.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons by side," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the UN General Council in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hissterism," said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The opposition party leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "hissterism" and said he didn't fit his temper to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman's performance like that, they'll say 'hissterism'," the Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Judiciary Council Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally challenged the charge that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and having trouble talking about his family and his years of high school.
He also clandestinely condemned Democracy in the committee, saying that the charges against it were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's witness proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was abusive to democracy.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democracy," he said.
Pelosi said he would try to accuse if he was approved, and if democracy gained more voice at the council of the Republican Representatives.
"I'll say like this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or FBI the truth, then he doesn't fit just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he was a Democrat. He was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision against the Health Services Program or Roe v. Wade, because he was viewed as an understanding conservative justice.
In the decision-making congregation, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who's hysterical and polite to go to court and expect us to say, 'is it not so great,' said Pelosi.
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's an ecise, adulation for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Telling me it's not weird, what do you think?"
He said, "I am greatly helped by a woman who is an executive in a place, who says that she also weeps when she is angry, but develops a technique that means that she is angry and begins to weep, and says to the man who speaks to her, 'You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of anger in part because he was basically misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, one time when I cried out with unexpressed rage, was that my belly was stabbed by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a bit afraid - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and would be happy because they think they're working."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, understood that there was no reason for himself not to run himself as president.
"That's not a mature decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone calls it "The Snow Princess and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he stayed behind in the fundraiser, and he swore he would not follow the election unless he had managed to raise $2 million.
It's a battle that's leading to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave him $1,000 to the man just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotion - gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with a system that made the fundraiser so difficult and to target the electorate from the delegation, and anger toward sexism - made it difficult to talk.
"You might think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my purpose?
"Are you crying?"
How the US-Tiokkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening-up of trade competition between the US and the Chinese was so exciting, and when the fight was still far from over, the conflict between the two countries might have benefited Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing the Tiokk key export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant celebration started this week with a new rate that affects items worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entered into the United States through China.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently priced up to five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
The Chinese have begged to join the US one-by-one, and the world's second largest economy won't change in a near future.
Asking Washington to retreat means following the will, but publicly indulging in the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of Tyogkok.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its card correctly, U.S. trade competition pressures can positively support Turkey in the long run by reducing the dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that rapid political decision-making by Washington or Beijing can make economic movement in both countries more dangerous than what was previously observed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
'Get ready' for refugees' return, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that they are ready to return to volunteer refugees and offer help to rebuild a country that has been destroyed by over seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safe thanks to the progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continued to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore them as they did.
All conditions are now present because of the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and a comprehensive economic decision that makes their daily lives and the eyes of their daily lives as targets.
The United Nations estimated that more than 5.5 million people in Syria had been displaced from its country since the war began in 2011.
The six million others who still live in that country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive conditional assistance from countries that supported rebellion.
