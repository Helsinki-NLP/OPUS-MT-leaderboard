UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that lasts almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chief again requested all parties, including the UN Security Council divided to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries in the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 figures from polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump at the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed that Donald Trump is driving with a percentage of two figures and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the numbering chances of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits showed that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's advance was taking place at the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But the outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Next we present you a few figures from recent polls that suggest that the property mogul is not just something passive:
Figures indicating Trump's support have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the property mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for nomination.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "entuziassmati" or "thank you" if Trump would win the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "surprising" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say it would be "enthusiasm" compared to 40% that says the same thing about Trump).
Closer to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "unthankful" or "sorry" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the property mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that it does not have the personality to act efficiently and nearly six out of 10 independents claim that their temperament does not have what they are looking for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the intellectuals' attitude, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed against the end of July, when four out of 10 would have betted Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
At the same time as last election, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while supporting Trump’s opposition will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from the majority support.
Trump is located at a distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, at 14 points by Marco Rubio, at 15 points by Walker, at 19 points by Jeb Bush and finally 33 points by Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey carried out on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that these will never change their mind.
46% say it leaves the door open to changing its option.
However, Trump's most important adversary is currently Ben Carson's neurosurgeon, but it's twice as likely as voters who say they've decided to vote with Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump appointed immigrants from Mexico as "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central subject in the 2016 campaign.
Some are worried that Trump's bomb style will lead to a break between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post poll, six of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A survey carried out two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the provision of the republicans in COngres, 54% declaring themselves "unthankful" and 21% "highly angry".
Jeremy Corbyn holds his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he called for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also said that he could give up some of his participations and give them up to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Party leader to remain silent at the address of the national anthem in a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that he "contained silence in a respectful manner" and recognized "the heroism of British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the two's Newsnight broadcast by BBC that the Labour leader would be recommended to sing the national anthem "no matter" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant states that differences in the policy are "cumulated" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr. Corbyn regarding his position with regard to the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "cap" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the rostrum for the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to address to Mr. Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North stated that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from repetitions and attacks, engaging instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional word, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs, but he admitted a few years later that he failed in his own way.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, of the way in which it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although the critics claim to become a cartoon and that it needs a profound reform.
‘Career in Joburg’: Young homeless people benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets of their childhood found a way to learn a job and to earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage enlargement
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a rise in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs in the company, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side-victim in the "furuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unlucky in the light of the reflections by the scandalous spread that Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a qualifier game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: “Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down.”
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place individually, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Davis Cup against England.
“One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted a little to conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's be serious, it's been extremely good in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's working hard and he's integrated into the team, he hasn't had any kind of conflict with the other players, he's very well respected at dressing, he's very hard, he's in an excellent shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important drawback game that starts on Friday, and described the “common decision” as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra on the long-term team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the drawback game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matures under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders is halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down by 58%), while Sanders is at the second place, 27% (up compared to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced if he is to run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates’ supporters.
Faced with the survey carried out by CBS news last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderators, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the best interests of old voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy five-point advantage in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters at the national level say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if he was chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it is the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters would be excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would want to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the Vice-President's consideration of a possible nomination for the presidency, 57% of the Democratic voters would like to see him running - although a third do not think he should run.
In the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn't.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the best chance candidate to win the general elections, but the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is at a distance in place two, but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
As in last month, no democratic or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well with regard to a few key features of their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustworthiness and strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three with regard to integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the Democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is fully and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have a view about him in this regard.
Democratic voters generally consider that the three Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
In all these respects, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
How the questions persist with regard to the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that this email-related controversy has not affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they've changed their mind about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton fully and confidently, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at general level: only 32% considers it integrity and trust, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in more.
62% of the voters do not regard it as integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not regard Trump as an integrity and trustworthiness.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are classified as the first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrity is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson’s case, many do not think about it.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity charged for the murder of the student in the year 1 of the Faculty of Baruch
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the Poconi Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi faculty of Baruch in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, as stated by the police.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, put a 14 kg sand-filled backpack behind him, and was repeatedly sudden while trying to get to a target on an frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused his headache after he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternal did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claiming that he had waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide personal goods and put practically the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng’s good,” Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head traumas, trunks and thighs.
"A lot of families were devastated by fraternal rituals, at least one student lost his life every year because of rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be responsible and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged for outrage and crime.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Faculty of Baruch prohibited the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its membership with local representation.
Here's what's going to happen when the Federal Reserve increases interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the market bubble (growing market) will suffer, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In the economy, history gives little clues to time frame..
After the first growth would rate interest, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when they begin to raise interest rates but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
But in the end, market players could see that all the agitation related to the increase in interest rate has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the ‘cheap money’s hero,” said Julian Jessop, the economist chief at the Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to fear.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We are still presenting how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipation of interest rate growth can evaluate things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which reflects the possible defamation of monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - with about 14 percent - to increase interest rate, quite invariably over the next 250 days (averagely 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but the increase in interest rate often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question "if this time it's different," said Deutsche.
Market players have been preparing each year for a Fed growth decision, all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that the WTO could approve an increase in interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipses before recession very fast after recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most serious recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first cycle growth/decrease occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of the bonds is immediately reduced," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, with the focus on the curve.
Obligations with high profitability are better done in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"Aside the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, profitability curve is fairer, the spread of average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed highlights politics.
In large lines, companies that carry out their majority activity in the U.S. will have to gain from the increase in interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise in the dollar will lead to their expensive products within the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that “quality stocks” tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in interest rate,” analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balances have exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital revenues and low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important problem.
Companies with a large proportion of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also gain from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save might also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio because he "protests"
It claims to be increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized Brits prizes.
A colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show is original
BBC Radio 3 "turns into" Classic FM, said an important parliamenter, putting pressure on the position to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also informed the BBC chiefs that the public radio station "protests" and resembles the commercial opponent more and more.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "protests" - although I don't like to use the word - but I think it's transformed into Classic FM," he said.
It also took BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent with regard to live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about the classical music I'm learning from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience to the earlier period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticised at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee because it would go to the tracks of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be carried out "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to “find the chicken with gold eggs in its own grade” next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future taking of new seasons from The Voice or to spend the money that goes to licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales have recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The latest month has seen the slowest growth from 2000 to now.
Online sales took advantage three years ago due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the November Black Friday could determine reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain’s commercial streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending in August showed the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with a growth of only 5% over the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and return until 2000, there has always been the tendency to rationalise in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, for Guardian.
He explained that online sales took advantage three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for a decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, about five times the average number of buyers has squeezed in front of computers to put their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of multiple retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers have beaten chilippers, could determine the reticence of buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made via online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to call fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the sanctioning of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the macara collapse in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked the streets of Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group construction for the crash.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following the crash of the macara
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara collapsed at the Mecca mosque.
Dressed in white, those who complained of death joined the road to express condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a building crane collapsed through the mosque's ceiling, falling upon the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which was also fought with 394 wounded.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara collapsed at the Mecca mosque.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macara crashed.
Mr Akram was in the Moschee Sea with his parents before starting the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group shouldn't have left the crane's arm up when the crane wasn't working.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group bears partially the blame for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but said the company leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Previously during this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macara crash in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements on the collapse of the crane and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of macara surround the Mecca Moschee Sea, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last leader Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a son of the family who was removed in the '90s.
The collapse occurred under strong wind and rain conditions, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of each physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people stay in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Rialis (174,000 pounds pounds) and that the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of loans into Swiss francs
Two loans to Swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Bank Transylvania has just completed the process of converting loans to Volksbank francs, and Bancpost has announced the offer of conversion for its customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvanian Bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83% of franc credit customers due to a second successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of risk commissions and customer-paid administration, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Bank Transylvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bankpost by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the collection of loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from the future growth of the franc, and the repayment of the loan will be made in the currency in which his salary is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the re-evaluation of the property is not done, additional guarantees and another proof of income are no longer required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancer.
Both banks also offer a reduction to the monthly rate, as much as they would pay customers before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the client repays very little of the main.
The very small-interested Bancpost offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that ROBOR index will grow significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it has exceeded 40%!
In addition, it may also appear other costs, not mentioned in the original offer.
The time has come for the decision on the interest rate for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world looks at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with 80 economists, a little over half that last week they thought the decision would be taken, I think now that the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing back trillion dollars in balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See that they lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been in stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer in 2009.
It is also rumored that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double leg fracture in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of the PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture on his leg and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe next week and then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but in the double fracture the break is for six months and you won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red cardboard and the concession of a penalty strike.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, starting my way to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat of PSV
The foundation of the team of England has an added reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “This is a very ugly accident.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never try to attack an opponent.
Moreno broke his foot playing for the Mexican national against the Dutch nationals led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
“It’s very hard because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious accident, it’s not right,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the thing.
I couldn't see but the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the SBS6 statement, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through this.
I feel so bad. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission, but he's still strong.
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the selected team from England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repetition of the 3-0 defeat in the test games.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a win on the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the batting line and collective morals is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze my decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven games test against two good attackers under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own selections.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll have some other opportunities.
The main coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not as much as his ability and did not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman gets noticed in the test games.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the way.
The only misunderstanding you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in full form - but that missed opportunity is past.
The team's coming Alex Hales, a batsman I'm doing very well.
He's a cricket player who has "X factor" and I noticed earlier in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up with Cook, which would take extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hit there and this left player already proved he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was no. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner post and, although I had limited contact with him, it hit me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his old age - with an average of 31 in the fight and 35 in the ball - and might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the pickers chose for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the coach team.
Name of Mahela Jayawardene, batsman of Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test games could be a master hit.
It's one of the best players and it's going to bring a lot of experience, since it's played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and unbeatable ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, the new voices in the locker room, even if it transmits messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for one day's games, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all of them agree, coaches and selectees do not do the program.
And you have to hold back, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easy.
The Brexit camp could have a cause if the economy remained in acalmy by 2017
As David Cameron's renegotiating strategy to keep the UK in the EU is becoming increasingly confusing, even without the general choice of Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
One European diplomat explained last day that - sunk in crises similar to that of the EU - not all of which are caused internally - some Member States are fed on the Great Britain's agenda of concessions and amendments to the Treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want this either if they would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the chancellor take part in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with a perspective outside the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor extremely cautious, is an ally but she has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation crumbles, as happened with Thatcher (age 11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English-based posers whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - a thing they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "Great Britain has not obtained any value from renegotiation".
The Europeans know on their skin how hives Fleet Street can be and how skeptics are barons in the oligarchic press that regard the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in report 2:1.
Perhaps I can remember vaguely from Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of non-tax payers, foreigners who cheated on telephone and pseudo non-domestics that hold most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him a exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who hit me back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may last, but it must develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left a vacancy on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution gently.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the conservatives' "anglicism" could agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to acknowledge that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as a shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any situation” - Benn’s expression - does not match what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to transmit -- hold it, it also sensitized me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the spin of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take the workers' support in the referendum campaign as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But the basic sophism of McDonnell and Corbien on EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is untiring about the fact that JC will not campaign for the resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be wasted political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to the Great Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as reminded me of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists Critics Decision of the Department of Public Health in England on Electronic Cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of which have links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the magazine British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published last month's "reference" report and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, a few researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the link between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet’s medical journal attacked the “extraordinary base of fragility” that PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ questioned their claims and founded them “on solid land or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claimed that the PHE claims that “current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multiple-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT's public health accreditation in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarettes producer but not the funding about which there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco-producing company, Philip Morris International.
There were no arguments on the basis of which panel members were selected, but among them are a number of "companies" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The Chief of the Tobacco Control Section of the PHE also participated at the meeting.
The research work carried out by the group "convincingly weighs" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most criteria", said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is no evidence to date that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at the PHE, said he had responded in the past to BMJ's statements.
He said, "Electronics are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is lower compared, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and those that does not arise from evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking amount to £2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - i.e., although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.
Illegal equipment of torture - delivered to the door!
Advertising that shames Britain's arms trade
Follow the film produced by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Fire for crushing the ankles!
Dispersive bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The merry voice and animated images do not leave any doubt that this advertisement for the world's greatest arms trade is an acute charade, carried out by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
Similar news: The arms trade DSEI: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and in metros that need a second look.
"An important announcement, travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the sources and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a large number of arms dealers will be placed on the DLR of clients being asked to contribute to the closure of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group named Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound Allen key package that states that "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London Transport Region is not amused by this vandalism in the form of steering wheel.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets shuttles traveling by metro.
The film produced by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the arms trade advertising -- with an empty space in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic commercial, but “enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more habitive.”
"They did a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the trade," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms trade comes from inside ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order from the U.S. Army on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped foci that give stunning effects to the back of the gun, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in Home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I can barely remember the forced smiles of those we're making -- and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nervous breakdown to fear.
Laughing is tempting: telling people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of pause at the studies, how you feel about Corbyn, and why “it’s sincere, it’s no matter whether you’re Marmite because, really, boys, it’s nothing but Dr. HAHAHA extract, you find me in my room.”
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These souls talk and help you to differentiate the people you like from those you would not talk to even if the tree would come and they would be the only ones that would have boats.
Don't choke people.
The dorms often abound with drinking parties, movies and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.
Similar subjects: Don't even think about starting student life in a relationship
Introductions have a special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refuge, but in many homes a hangout culture is built through dorms, based on friendship, socialization and friends that last for a lifetime.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want you to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I've consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit down when a colleague is suspended from socializing - and try to send a text instead of knocking at the door.
That's about knocking at the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same home with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock at someone's door to make knowledge and take along and a plate with niggers, it seems less strange, less genial of the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
The goodies prepared in the house are a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and might end up associating your figure with a tasteful surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good chef.
Cocolates of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend that they sleep when you knock at the door.
Eating theft is a frequent crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in tea is all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - you're still trying to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
He's in jail now.
Don't make any noise that won't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the stand with me asked her neighbor to slow down the music because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give the music harder.
When they stopped music in the end, at 5:00 a.m., the girl was kind enough and let her sleep two hours before she went to the maximum music, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/v future wife would move on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you were to confuse a teammate with your future husband, you would couple, you would split up and you should meet every day and maybe even see him as he gets all common friends?
Of course, you can't fight your heart - but if a sexy teammate certainly isn't your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The moment you realize that someone left their keys in the locked room, the line between prank and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful prank is funny, but it can denture in a few moments.
You teach a funny and valuable lesson about safety hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not stick the goods of someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: There were no world tournaments at the time of Bach.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a solist but also as an initiator of a less ordinary project, right "city", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of talented international soloists and musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it to be at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, Sunday, in which the solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when the violinist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works made by Enescu were not seen.
Both performances, performed on the Athens scene, showed the public another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and was at that time the only classical musical ensemble where there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become solos, or to be an orchestra interpreter - I'm talking about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They're formed as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the music fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, is marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on one side skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but we have to look, what is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The rapist tells us that this change in the way he does music came after "musical disappointments" in his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn lots of money and to bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So we haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you're marketing with a group of musicians where there's no ego anymore?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Disonaces represents "a luxury", specifying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the ensemble, the absence of a conductor has not proved to be a trap in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the more simple it seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not only in the role", supports Grimal, adding that to Sunday's show "I was 74 conductors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are present the largest orchestras in the world who sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "for there's also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal seeks to change the way classical music education is done, considering that "the music industry, as it is organized today, has an ice of death" and as "the future of music represents the music itself".
We don't need to make the world tour five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums, they are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the music service.
If not, we're in a system in which creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
In order to enter the EU, health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds may not be too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his teaching into school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell music by-products," says Grimal.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that stay very communist, that all over the world, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, before all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it has to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's something else.
After your appearance, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes just from exceeding this "soldier" status, exceeding what "you think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert there are smiles."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and the artist at the "Idea Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romanian Institute.
David Grimal's Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at School des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.
David Grimal has an international career of solo violinist, throughout which he has maintained regular concerts over the past 20 years on the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Paris Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, National Orchestra of Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphoniker, New Japan Philharmonic, Orchestra of Lyon, Mozartium Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Warsaw, under the leadership of directors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Sch.
He was the recipient of a number of dedicated works from several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
In addition to his career as solo artist, David Grimal intended to explore and more personal projects.
The freedom that he offered his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
At the same time as Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Other Season", a series of concerts given to the benefit and together with people without shelter at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Starting in 2008, David Grimal was a resident artist at the Opera in Dijon.
She teaches violin courses at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
You also hold many Master's courses and was a member of the Long-Thibaud International Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" of 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by French wrestler Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present at the International George Enescu Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also got on the stage Monday, this time with the violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "The Little Voices"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: the dubling of two characters from the superproduction "Creasa Zăpezia 3D"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him the chance to get a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, they are eager to reach the next stars and who are between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City is looking for "Micile Voci Mari", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classical drawings the focus was on approaching the voice of the actor of the specific animated character, in the last period, the story creation is taken into account and those who are about to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and get the parents to join their children in our contest.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are fun.
"The boys will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania said.
In the first stage of competition, between September 11th and September 30th, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection that will be selected 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is to access the small voices platform.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child to the contest and prepare it for voice proof.
Later, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read and then the child will register by interpreting his own double version.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Sun" and "Albinuța Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double as a character from the super-production "The Snow Queen - 3D Snowfowl Cray", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx winnings are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 are low
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing the annual profit estimates as a result of the low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's actions decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with less than 20 cents, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lowering estimate is despite the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and the higher overtaxes for the land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply since November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase profits compared to the previous year as a result of the reduction of costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director General Fred Smith stated that "the signature faces a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular as regards global production and trade."
The employment plans during the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he was planning to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The gains per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit has risen by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.2 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the online shopping explosion struck the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, income from the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic rates, while revenues from the Freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% at $150.15.
Tuesday closed by 11% at the year level and 17% compared to the record maximum on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most awaited meetings in recent years, those responsible for the development of the Federal Reserve policies will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a mural painting of the United States will be presented.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, Fed President, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank received a double charge from Congress: maximizing the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be disarmed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Although most data indicate a growing economy, recent global financial market agitation could scare Fed officials already careful to add volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by a quarter of the percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stilel Nicolaus & Co brokerage firm.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them more reasons to wait," he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, it itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg's recent economists anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But the financial markets expect Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the growth probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease on the stock exchange if Fed increased interest rate, except where policy makers would reduce the impact by promising that it would spend a lot of time until the next growth.
Tuesday, the industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The wind was triggered by the expectations that Fed decision makers will maintain the rate of stable interest this week, John Lonski said, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that Fed would raise interest rates at this time," Lonski said.
If Fed's decision-makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets."
Other experts said an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty linked to the time Fed was going to act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowing the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it was expected to increase the interest rate this year despite the objections raised by the liberals such as the need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to not reach the annual target of the central bank, Fed’s decision factors claimed that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling sharply.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them given the stress on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets have started to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China has devalued its currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones has dropped by 16% below the record peak reached in May, as investors have feared that slowing down the Chinese economy will bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat recovered this month, the Dow index being now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate growth.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he's forecasting that they'll wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is very much uncertainty about the impact on the US economy and almost no data on subsequent China events," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so virtually it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But in reality, Fed became the monetary authority at the world level.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The President's hint, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "strengthened" his monetary expansion triggered a earthquake on the world markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly launched, it is to be expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the Investnet welfare management firm Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an over-sized reaction history on financial market changes that seem unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications of limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to those falls.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the case of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake Adam S. Posen, was a member of the Bank of England interest rate-setting committee.
The last hectic period does not rise to that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get in the situation to fear an increase in interest rate because of having upset the markets," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this direction, I do not believe that it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite attempts by the Nine channel to broadcast in Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party did not result in a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Nine's morning channel broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competitive Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascada Niagara and Cancun.
This distance "crusade" didn't seem to matter too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having a audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today had a slight increase compared to the hearings of Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in the past few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series having as protagonist the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, under the subject of a widowed father who recently decided to move along with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night responded resoundingly that “yes”.
The X show The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000) was held in position with 1,136 million viewers.
Seven recorded lifts and descents on the second night of transmission of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia showed an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge number of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia the second night will give silent confidence to the Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets in the protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the new proposed constitutions of the country on Wednesday, said an officer.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 280 km west of the capital city of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and moltoov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas after they fired fires in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
According to it, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The crash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would erode their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants the state itself.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent strikes triggered on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, the country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new card could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns

Another well-defined front of low pressure approximately half the distance between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction in patients with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetes with mild obesity lives more after weight loss surgery than those who pursue necrosurgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to lower your stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal within the range 18,5-24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and persons with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data gathered after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomy in the manson - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in patients who have undergone surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of the study.
In the meantime, BMI in people who received neurgic treatments against diabetes remained at almost the same level, namely 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured at only 1% and partly at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol was generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin level A1c decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved glycaemic control - reflected by improved haemoglobin levels A1c - has not reduced mortality to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the gastrectomy group in the manson, the bypass surgical intervention group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1%) and showed a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study performed on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, Blackstone says, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% lower mortality after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit to patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 procedural interests.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's very hard to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution for the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to end the violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama talked about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in front of the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce the crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US' violent response has generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without calling for violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the anti-traviral centre in Georgia, U.S. anti-traviral centres reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in terms of the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the anti-travial center in Georgia, the cases of ingestion of the hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-travial centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, one percent of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies showing teenagers how to drink detergents to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavor, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-hospital centre at Kansas University Hospital, for Fox channel 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hands detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four strawberry sprays with strawberry flavouring hands, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol 179, twice as large as an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bloating and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free wet products or utensils and no longer let the hands cleaner at the children's disposal.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they swallowed hands that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students from northern New York planned to poison their professor "bad" by "putting antibacterial products into class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "not meant" and raised the disciplinary issue of the school inspector.
Rumour Mill: There are no misunderstandings in Celtic
Griffiths demonstrates rumors about Celtic misconceptions, admitting that Hoops are not at the best moment but will return.
Hearts with SFA on Neilson and Warburton charges are cautious about the January acquisitions that affected the team's unit
Dons increases the difference from Celtic to five points
The criminalization of ADAM Rooney in the first round brought them to Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of the Hamilton people in Pittodrie, Dons achieving a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths exposes rumors related to misunderstanding
There were rumors about misunderstanding in Celtic, defunct by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team were not under increased pressure as they were preparing to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think players just wait.
The absence of Scots in the race for title bores the Dutch - by Boer
Former middleman of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title of Rangers.
De Boer, the current ambassador of Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands he no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic games; why?"
Because it's not Rangers there.
Here, it's not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
It's talking about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams and there's interest going.
The tension is high in the Old Firm games and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic is fighting out of power but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: "Celtic has had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to go on.
We do need the support of Celtics because so the players become better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's judgment on transfers from January
Despite comments from just a few weeks ago that suggested that some targets for the January transfers would be identified, the chief of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the unit of the Hebox team.
Former Head of Brentford said: "The period of transfers in January is very different from that in the summer."
In the case of transferred players in the summer, there is a period before the season when they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you get worse if you bring in unnecessary players.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw upon the expiration of the agreement with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts with SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “We have not doubted integrity, we have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to the point when he admitted that he played a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
“It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment,” the striker added, adding: “I don’t need to say that I don’t go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic.”
Tannadice Council Trusts Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in Dundee United still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but it agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "poor victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team has to cling desperately to Hamilton Accias to get the seventh successive win in the league, which has brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the first shot of punishment by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team to win anything, in the cup or league, and not to win such games.”
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
RATA THE SCHOOL in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in the period May, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom overall increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom of 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has decreased by 12,000 over three months, with the number of employees currently employed by 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure over the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of employment registering growth and the unemployment rate decrease.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the enforcement room of the State Penitentiary Oklahoma and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified of the idea.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can witness executions in America and, because applications usually exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, get access.
I cried at her.
He acknowledged that “it could have been better, ” but he still feels that they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
However, he wishes to have an international report on the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, publicity will help to counter capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, the reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of media files that I made.
I'm not coming back here on every detail.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees make him guilty of complicit.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there's been enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
You'll find out from me what it's like to look at a man who likes to die useless.
Peter Moody claims that thetewars tried to spy on him and threatened to retreat from the races
Peter Moody said that the Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewars and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are carrying out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass with the removal of Lady Dadi from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to look like "the fox that doesn't get to the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all bursts suddenly," Moody said.
It's known it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I'm working with to see that I'm trying to offer them everything that's best.
As soon as they start to think that's not the case, I have to give up the training job.
At that moment I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview for raiding.com saying the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I’m going to tell him if I’m asked - and offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody said for Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then you should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Sandry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having a spine and can hold people out of trains accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and step aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might lead them to think about this option.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on it and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration increased with the long-term investigation of cobalt testing involving Lidari and the elimination led him to say that he could “put his license on the table”.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, has labeled the treatment rule of the day of the race as "ridicile" after applying on the legs a cataplasm with nemol or clay, which violates the rules.
It's violating the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put a nose on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which has happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which thetewarsi opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand the need for rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the crash site.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being badly injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the wounded biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man handed himself over to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of running from the scene of the accident, of disposing of the first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the claims of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the plaque tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought into discussion by the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to “take them to the beat” of the team in the game won by Storm in the final rating played on Friday night in Sydney.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called the match a "show" of rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into defense of the courting tactics addressed by his team and said that the players simply focused on "contact" when they did.
Bellamy says she gained confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us up with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything every year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we have really put the emphasis on contact in pleasure and thus changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not common to lose and it was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "smoothing the football," reminding his mentor St George-Illawara Dragons won Bennett's 2010 championship by playing "plitistic" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talking about how exciting the game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team, and Wayne said he doesn't care as much about black under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be palpitating football, especially due to the middle young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not any team has two middles like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a stronger score-related match compared to the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't I seen him yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more trials, which means exciting game?
Or does it mean to pause and not march?
It's plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means at some point we could meet.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks, in the finals of Saturday's previews at AAMI Park, the tickets being put on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then authenticated to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.
After the arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worried” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed to have done it to “draw the paedophiles” over the Internet before he “proclaimed he was a cop to scare them off.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: “He said it was an addiction - it is dependent to scare people.
He admitted he did search the computer but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who had sent his images and about the fact that he had asked the person to send other photos.
He said he did it to challenge.
He said that he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see images with rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the little girl found her messages on the phone, she cried and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he had made or made indecent photos of children, and violated the conditions of release on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the sexual offender register because it can be said that this offence “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was in the sexual criminal register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall has not been hurt. It has become viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by representatives of the opposition who claimed that they would have received anonymous threats to death, threatening them not to persuade Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they escaped during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is entitled "death," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns Members concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once Parliament is left, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 availabilitys as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide the stock exchange into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services that are increasing.
The anticipated availability will cost about $2.7 billion from quarter four, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business run style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better placed than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual income of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the object of the production of electrical equipment and the garage of which Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley.
HP has passed through massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest companies in the field of technology in the United States, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus best on one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of 20-45-year-old deaths in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Unfortunate Life (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy disposition”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces to half the probability of the occurrence of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate nature of the response has often priority prior to contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, open to fun and success personality, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinstic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey's and Chandler's frequent huggings, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be associated with this situation, even though they often fail to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people who call us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk open about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer several long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series has highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people reaching out in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you are taking part in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG take Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to enforce in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
Next we present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the League of Champions, with a quiet 2-0 win against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions in advantage although they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the minute 61.
Reaching the Group A with Real Madrid and Shahior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only the qualification in the best but also an improvement of the route towards the quarter final in each of the last three tournaments.
However, even though they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of emptying after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or on the way to the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory creates our opponents' problems and sets a comfortable difference with the next class, even though there are other aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't make it one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw from Bordeaux home in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in minute four.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive medium was called the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he slammed at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before making an incredible whisper over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defense of five and two half-defensives, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making the whisper of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the minute 34.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary and non-finalizing steps, even Ibrahimovic who missed not less than five tests only in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved to be much more successful in supporting his colleagues, and he cares about what Di Maria sent in a hijack from Wiland over the gate in minute 52.
The second goal was recorded in the final after an hour of the game came to pass, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who signed the sixth empty in the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This goal has eliminated the hope of Malmo that they will rebalance the score and only a superb stop to Wiland from afar for the rejection of David Luiz maintained the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entrance cancels an extension goal.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "The last game I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by lower share prices on the commodity stock market, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is in transit with the falling prices on the commodity stock market, because China's decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in the markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on London stock exchange in transactions on Wednesday morning.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of broader plans to cover almost a third of its debt of $30 billion.
The company sold its new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the price of closing Tuesday.
He took out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the prolonged stagnating Chinese economy led to a substantial rise in iron ore prices of about half, and coal, copper and other goods fell by 20-40%.
Xi insists on the wider expansion of the global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy must open wider to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must undertake to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said, in the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leadership Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting the openness and encouragement of reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legislative-based business environment and providing a wider opening up of the market.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers of companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
China will also, as stated, allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open the State controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and will provide them with better services," the statement stated.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to request permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising the requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli participated at the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not content with the Government's proposal to raise salaries by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education have not achieved any results, the Government proposing a 10% increase in wages, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase, from November, or a 20% increase, from December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today has not pleased us, otherwise we would not have come to the situation to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent that promised us today are less than we expected.

The former selectioner testified that he did not understand President FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after taking his place at Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
Eventually, he proposed to the Federation's chief to raise his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the national.
Then I thought I was sorry, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed it too.
But I wanted to go.
If he wanted to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We have about 400 and something thousands of euros a year, and then we have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.

American Nick Hess was told by his family that he was an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, he was visible as being drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret," he tells, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't admit, "I was looking in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Besides, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's thoughts the most out of his mind was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was found that he had a three-fold alcohol problem over the legal term, although one night before he had been consumed only one beer.
After years and investigations without number, it was found that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".

Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf course
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had on the dealer's side.
The man attacked his car with a golf course, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, broadcasts BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, for the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has faults that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car didn't solve his problem, just as he agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "a stage that Romania is still going through in efforts to modernise the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The source mentioned shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the countries of the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are taken to manage the situation of unity and coherence as a result of the possible influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by the political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will give special attention to citizens from states with potential migrationists or who can harm national security," adds the remembered source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a few general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the seat of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
Among these are: facilitating access to Romania's territory of third-party citizens who respond to the demands for the occupation of the labour force, promoting the access of third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for areas and professions identified as deficit.
With reference to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system for halting the growing migration phenomenon".

Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the increase in the total cost of the labour force across the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year compared to the similar period in 2014, according to the data published on Wednesday of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employee expenses.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of the labour force rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third place in the EU at rising labour force cost

In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of the labor force.
Activity report of TVR, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks resigning
The Committees of Culture of Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Society of Television in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted, one against the rejection (Mr. Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next full-time meeting will be debated.
"I think considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the president of the Senate Cultural Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was a good feeling" that the TVR could also be present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was good to be present at TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members just last night, with an approximate hour that we didn't know about the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think that when you're summoned, you're a budget employee, paid out of public taxes and you're summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you don't like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the committees assembled by Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed in the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we also saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
"I remind you that not because of my fault or any other of these committees have lost that pleasure with banks and tax, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting, there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the director general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will sit at the tail here and beat himself.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary, by their vote will choose the people who will drive TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what quality you need to have -- I feel good about the attitude of the employees because it's a bunch of little kids coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you receive such sessions 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although the president-general of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, did not appear in Parliament, he sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament should have regard to a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the listing and indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to indexing the TV tax, the amendment and addition of HG 978/2003 on the fee for public television service, for the purpose of updating provisions at the level of technological change on the day, as well as for the regulation of the procedure for controlling the payment of the TV tax and the finding of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become representatives of the SRTv for the collection of the TV tax by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of the incasaries.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the 3% level, but also changes the law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the acquisition of licents for major cultural and sport events - the World Football Championship, Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months since the labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and wages rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"So travel and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a series of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July, the TVR News post was closed", the letter of the president of TVR showed.
It also appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied solely by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the institutions of the State - Government, Parliament, Presidency - The Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, unable to complete its public mission", is mentioned in the letter.
The House of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

It would have been his option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There were more discussions, such as that with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been realized," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad early this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
The full Parliament voted on Wednesday the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes "for" and 108 "impotry".
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, please inform Digi24.
Furthermore, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this capacity and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, in conditions where he has a file on DNA, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign her from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow her to make any more policy.
The PSD will serve as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority, which remains free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the "Burnt" movie, the actor made a breakthrough that his fans were not expecting.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a cook."
He devalued that he had been working in the kitchen for 15 years, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he went on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the entire childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, relates ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the type of man to plan for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you laugh about if I tell you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was accomplished.
Up to the age of 40, the actor admitted that he was seen in the near future directing, taking on the model of Clint Eastwood, who was taken by the royals all at this age.
The bridge, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational assertions
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned, on Wednesday morning, the statements of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to the political decisions of Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational claims, he insults the entire Hungarian minister," he sent the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he completely lost support in Romania's internal policy", added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the host of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The barma chimata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are policy makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which they flee those refugees!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - which we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these objectives and values!" the head of the Roman executive stressed.
Previously on Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, qualified as "simple lies" the remarks of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of the refugee crisis by Hungary, appreciating that these statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extreme and lying marks" of the Romanian Prime Minister live by the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest expects excuses from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic discourses, the idea of closing the borders, like all those who are coming with terrorists, are bullshit by the Middle Ages, and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with the bat and with the insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to begin preparations on the ground for the expansion to the border with Romania of the fence that it builds on the border with Serbia, to face a possible change of the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence solves nothing of the refugee problem and "is Hungary in Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the macara collapse of Mecca?
Saudi authorities announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible for the collapse of a crane, Friday, on the Mecca's Moschee Sea, an accident following 107 people died.
According to an investigation committee, the company did not "respect the safety rules", reported the Saudi Press Agency (PSA), reports BBC.
The company's directors were prohibited from leaving until the investigation was completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is currently led by former terrorist leader Bakr's brother.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at the expansion of the Moschei, so that it can host more pilgrims.
The accident took place Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by powerful winds, collapsed on the eastern side of the Moscow Great roof in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Did Hagi Shut The Opposite Mouth
Considered by many of the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after the withdrawal of activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performances and in the new position.
After unfortunate experience at the national team, Staraua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year later, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team that he owns.
After a year after taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he was able to turn a team that was struggling to rescue from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, the future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remixes and 11 offenders.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights at the European Cups.
Things took a better and better turn for the future this season, as the team arrived at second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy to promote young people, and in the last period in the start team appeared names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made in the future a tracking team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Yanis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Baris - 500 thousand euros).
In addition to the Star, the Future is the only profit-making team in League 1, according to the Trade Register data.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
The big ones come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the very police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as well and adapt to them as we do.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and that was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
Clearly, the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the board.
All the predictions said they had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the unanimity principle applies in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it with a vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, the reaction of rejection even in Germany was against the policy of opening Chancellor Merkel and they didn't want in many countries to look like a reaction of the "EU sending migrants to our heads".
So, the problem remains, however, because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably assist in major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory odds weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to get colder?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk about a greater involvement of Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members on the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe he'll give up on the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are responsible for the first time in the state, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece capitulates, you can't say infinity that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve a solution without a precise, perhaps mandatory, mechanism of imparting the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they reach them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European States will be taking over migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be single filtration centres in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophob current.
Cert is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in a precarious camp and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says only 10% have gone away, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave may even be bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so catastrophicly in the media.
You're talking country with less or more experience.
Does there really seem to you to be a place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture is possible?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, in the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean it doesn't integrate at all.
There was an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the UK.
But the police are not going to work.
To create the fortress of Europe is illusive.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be addressed.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let's ask these people to learn their language, to try to take over, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including by the convenience couple.
But the imminent problem of these people's long-term problems of their integration must be separated.
If others have failed in long-term integration it doesn't mean we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of these people coming with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean it's gonna make it last night and you can take them back.
Until the solutions appear, we see forts within Europe.
Borders are closed, walls are raised, checks are reintroduced at the border into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project that is not so, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and setting the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where they first set their feet.
I mean, we're just moving around, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave it can't be done, because some countries don't make a face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the French attacks, we don't have much more effective anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from home politicians under pressure to be virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the European only real market.
And I don't think the Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
Like there's gonna be other rules, it's different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted to the situation right now.
How did Romania play so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks that if he pulls the needle on his eyes and blinds his ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big ones come with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will decline very much.
President Johnnis says it's probably good that I haven't already come in.
So we move from despair of entering a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will join Schengen so that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
What doesn't mean it's a reason we're not going into Schengen anymore, but we're going to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed into common responsibility by external borders, there will be single rules for the acceptance of migrants, single rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for the countries considered safe.
Ukrainian President said that after Russia moved his attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of Putin, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to collapse before the main or opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates a fire of instability and chaos that it can't close.
But you're great power only if you have your solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
It's probably that Putin's waiting to get bids, press the buttons to fix the situation.
The offerings don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve things in one way or another created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users got used to the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social network prepare another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, inform New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will show rather a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posted on the account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
The network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded that they have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like that post," Facebook representative pointed out.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not received well by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted with this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, claimed there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, media social analyst at the eMarketer company, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the electoral campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of people on the table at her southern border with Serbia, announced Government Counsellor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared urgent during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main point of crossing the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The move drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
They said yesterday they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said the Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also registered in Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the Judicial Council stands to fall.
Two manufacturers in insolvency
Massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are going to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the Judicial Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling alone.
One-and-a-half years after the building's consolidation and reconstitutionalization work had been completed, the work did not reach half.
One last stage in the building’s epic was consumed last day, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract for the completion of the technical project for the work that is still to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of an Impex Romcatel participation announcement, which was to update the technical project and then to organise a new works auction.
"The negotiations did not, however, conclude through a contract, CJ appreciating that the proposed form would be disadvantaged the institution," Răzvan Timofciuc summarized, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to terminate direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to CNSC, which rejected it as late.
But this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision in the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of the Court can be taken into consideration finding another designer.
Thus, building building consolidation could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
Basically, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we have to get to the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on strengthening the former Police Survey office started in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being helped by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payment of 1.5 million lei.
The work has so far been carried out in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, the work of consolidation, recasting and softening of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"Okay, I'm telling you everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the ex-husband from Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record of the Cadastru Office signed a reconnaissance agreement, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A counsellor from the Office of Cadastrus and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) was accused of DNA in a corruption file and acknowledged his telefap.
The Agreement on the Recognition of the Facts signed by Dumitru Dăcălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, the judges setting out a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dsălu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in the stalls with delay as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts attributed to Dcelu, the prosecutors stated that he, as advisor to the Office of Cadastru, together with other colleagues, "made in false several verbatim acceptance processes, sold the previously-keyed service loan contracts by O.C.P.I. and the administrators SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC the Ca dastru and Topographies SRL and PFA Lipșa Stefan, who testified, in an unrealistic way, that the contracted services were fully performed, under conditions where they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I.I. Iasi".
Last days, the former chief of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but other former or current UCCI employees were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the companies concerned, although the works were not carried out.
Pre-trial is more than 300,000 lei.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of female handball for qualification at the Olympics costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday at a press meeting that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
As for the Romanian National Women's Handball Team, "the main objective is the qualification at the Rio Olympic Games, but for this reason it has to pass two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the prequalification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masons, gate coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification of some things, exactly material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do whatever it takes to get them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But this is the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said that he is trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president also referred to Romania's infrastructure and to the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is ashamed to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that other corners of the world have built entire Olympic lands within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a highlight of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic organisation was a success and from the point of view of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu has gone civilized with a project, people have agreed in principle, but they have made it very quickly that the room will never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited them to the first match in the new room in Bucharest and then we discussed concrete.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," the official explained.
The former great handbalist avoided evaluating the chances of women's CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare teams to reach Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in predictions, that if they don't complete they will return against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all members of the Romanian lottery are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We are ready."
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at full speed.
We've trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But certainly, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup, it is the haunting of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent three colors," Macove said.
Romania's National Team Selector Lynn Howells, who was first trained in the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
For me it's an extraordinary experience.
For me it's very important that every game I make the Romanians be proud of the national team.
Romanian Federation President of Rugby, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I believe we will be at the heart of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams for 18-19 years, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends who set themselves up to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, with the following scheduled matches: France, on 23 September in London; Ireland, on 27 September in London; Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the match England - Fiji in group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the University of "Al.I. Cuza"
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, the painting in the cough, but also a light study of the beautiful arts specific to the Land of the Sun Rising you can learn at the courses organized by students from the east.
The circle of Japanese Culture Students in Iasi organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, Sumi and Fine Art) between October 2015 and June 2016, courses for both beginners and for people who are consulted.

For these there is only one 50 lei per month participation fee.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to participate in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I proposed to you were conceived as an invitation to the general public to make the first step on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"People interested will be able to find out how to realize harmonious floral sculpture creations (ikebana), how to surprise the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using Japanese art of painting in tus (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the multivalent universe of beautiful arts (grafic, drawing, painting)," said Sorin Mazilu, professor of these courses.
Courses are addressed to all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registration takes place until September 30, and those who want to ask for more information can do it on the phone number: 0742.027.153 or on the e-mail address: student culture@gmail.com.
14 million lei you give to the "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Iași to the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and development of clinics, as well as in medical equipment and techniques for which the hospital has already started the procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, six kits used for surgery, six ATI beds with appropriate ophthalmogenic microscope and other equipment required for medical action.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to construction and arrangement of "Mareulua Ars".
From the money from the budgetary correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will receive the works from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the sick in UPU to nearby clinics," explained the director of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tataraşi, which will organize in the ambulatory, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will function in the area where allergology, haematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
Ichaul, laughed at by RATP controllers and a folder.
A tourist's skin
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaş to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to press again in your city.
Unwanted, they hit the misinformation from the folders, the misnomer of RAPT controllers, and, bonus, a "law-so-called" fine.
The wives arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed at a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist folds.
They also got a fold-up in which the RATP tracks were passed.
"Arms" with these maps, husbands visited Iashul.
But two days ago, you found out in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because she wasn't a ticket tone at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the folder: that I can take ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Folding trusts, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the folder.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, I'm coming a night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us a single fine instead of two (mistress and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spoil my day visiting the booth at the Jandarmerie and giving the statements there!" Ovidiu told.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the incorrect information on the folder and the controls that "have applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a session at the RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the idea is that I felt wrong.
Embarrassment for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial arrest
The trial of the seven rapists at Vasu moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal Iasi.
The former magistrates tried the first term of trial at a non-public meeting in which the seven young accused that they had insulted an 18-year-old woman called for release.
Before the actual commencement of the court hearing, one of the foreign judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge has been active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Section Pane, the one who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge raised by four of the defendants, having their place in detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu are judges.
Previously, in the file, he made a abstention and Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter is in a relationship with one of the rapist lawyers.
The two judges have decided that Vaslui's violators continue to remain in pretrial arrest.
Your blacks will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when the Jews will rediscover the possibility of their release.
The next deadline will be held at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iasi, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Paccuria district, the car entering the Iasi on the belt.
Iveco's autoutility that the seven rapists were hauled hit a Volks wagen car that came out of the Singa Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van circulates from the end of Paccurari.
The car entered Iasi around because the employees of the Prisoners' administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arresters called for another transport, to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the site of the accident from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary, who took over the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer it to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the noodles, and the arrests came out in speed, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because drivers of the door cars have understood it amiably with regard to the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Tăranu of the IPJ.
Large migration
Romania is not even ready for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the 7000 refugees that they should and should naturalize Romania are, in itself, a insignificant number, but huge compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, goes far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinary.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasited by interlocking and paralysed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The power to integrate them into the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any colour were unable to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent medical assistance, collect street poverty, create honorable jobs or keep their own younger generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they run from?
But what causes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We first hit the belligerent fetus of strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearless hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, other religion, other blood.
Probably afraid of stealing someone's national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invokes the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and there's no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be missed.
The causes must be eliminated, some are supported and, strictly based on the book of political justice, ask for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself as an ankylosed, dissociated and outdated construction.
I deplore the fact that Romania is unable to invent a country project, but here neither the EU has a future plan.
And improvisations and threats don't help at all.
What, then, does the EU use, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.

Two brothers in Tomești swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, ate more Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was taking a treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the "Saint Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years he received a bold gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear conditions, in the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met back in Iasi with biological parents from a county village, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to offer their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, to meet her unclear past.
"Jași's Day", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after some very vague clues, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
The report of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are rightly moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crinia starts 20 years ago in the exit town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
At home there were differences between parents, and my mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I knew nothing.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," Alina recalls, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the girl's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria City, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be permanently broken up.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After being hospitalized, Crina's father went to work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She would have thought she was abandoned," tells a family niece.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl stayed in the care of doctors.
Because no one has ever been interested in the child's fate at all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, which then gave her to care for the Buchium Placement Center.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were easier regulated than in Romania today.
At the Buccium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their baby but did not succeed.
They fell in love with the blondness of Crina, and after some time it would have moved permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," she tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he grabs in his hand the daughter's feral hand.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he received no answer where he could be his child.
The police then told him that he might be dead, but at Iasi parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for her have never been.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her in all those years that have gone by, but there's been no way we could walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crina's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," she confesses delighted Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Romanian Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Adviser, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the organic family of Crinai.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I just got a name, the Coastal Balkans, then the town, the Ruginoosa.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there's a local name.
Then they gave me a few indications, just that the person you found wasn't the one you were looking for.
"It took about a month before we found the girl's biological father," Chief Romanian Commissioner Ichim explained.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each one had a home in another town.
We started our moves somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we determined that a first meeting would take place in September," added Romica Ichim.
On the weekend that he spent, Alina and Costica first saw the girl lost in the hospital halls in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, excitedly, could barely control his tears, and his hands were still shaking.
He's barely talking to the people around.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still nervous, trembling.
"To see your baby after all these years, it's something," tells us a granddaughter, who comes with Costica from Ruginosa.
Christian Meeting With Mother and Organic Brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costică Balkan told him, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to him in the village, she could come in peace: she could give him some sheep, goats, so she could find a boy in the village and hang a house.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly believes that such a thing could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very large emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," he tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Crina's mother, while he keeps a napkin tight in his hand.
In him he hides his tears, of happiness, because in a short time he will see her face after such a bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be serving in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's drawn a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iași
In the Union Market, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginosa rejoined their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is 20 years ago, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
He no longer splits borders or countries, but only a barrier: language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of the place in the center of Iaş, have easily passed.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if there is a chance, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional load, and I'm happy to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution dealing only with consumers, drug dependent people.
But we're trying to redecorate something good back to the companies.
"If I'm still being asked for such an event, I'll do it very warmly," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Council.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, departs by telling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with arms to the foot, yesterday, to the PSD.
Everybody shoots their soul
The stables of the PSD's outgoing subsidiary have concluded an armistice with the weapon on their feet.
After successive rounds of discussions, held from Friday to Sunday, first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united, social-democracy position to the party will send him an entire list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
From the end, the internal war of the party seems to have taken only a break to allow fighters to draw their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution not to jeopardize the party.
On October 3rd, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
In the October elections, a strong competition is expected to be expected for the Chair of the PSD’s county subsidiary.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main function of the party's outgoing subsidiary is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Counsellor of Vasile County and Acting President of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant considered is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillor Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be running, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in functions.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former leader of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be candidates, and would not impress anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we stay united, and we will stay together after October 3rd, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Judicial Bureau and all the new leadership structures," said Quanta.
Until the organization of the internal elections, the leadership of the county subsidiary of the PSD will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nikita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, preparing the elections to be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the subsidiary, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions over the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached in order to support a uniting team to deal with the county.
"On the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy of the Iasi PSD presidency, the list remains open," Stanciu commented.
A outgoing judge refused Vaslui rapist file on grounds of co-operation
The seven young men of Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iași.
Vasluiens sentenced to punishment between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the trial court, the Vaslui court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was handed down.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton has invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the custodian of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest penalty in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Judgment
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Judiciary, who sentenced the seven young men, motivated the sentence.
On the basis of reason, the judge talks about the challenging reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, specifying that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The instance finds that after the time of the pre-emptive placement of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not privatized of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, of their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community as to the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure", is shown in the motive of the Judge of Vaslui.
The magistrates also demonstrated the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The instance stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is of no relevance, something that the defendants have wished to highlight through the defences they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext", it is further stated on the ground.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last ten years can no longer continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday probably few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many people wonder to what extent it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (at one point told Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the Russian Today television channel), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered Osama bin Laden's murder as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States' favorite.
According to the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the kind he was telling and promising and Tsipras in Greece until he breasted with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader includes, inter alia, massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money-printing solution is not unanimously adopted on the globe, we would then have a global overall prosperity! but who else prevents such details.
Of course, we can charge the bankers with blood, become some kind of left service enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous, uncovered promises made by the populace demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher's attention was well drawn to, "the problem of socialism is that at some point someone else's money is being spent."
Little by little I give Jeremy Corbyn the real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his convictions as the party's fresh leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
And then there is still in the Great Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has made the industry require a massive high-skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times, Corbyn's election is believed to increase Brexit's chances and the exit of Great Britain from the EU.
The new Labour Leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this type of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigrant rhetoric and look at the crisis of refugees shaking from the EU foundations you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
But if the British decide on the basis of the referendum, which was to take place until 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it of the Euro crisis and now the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
More than a whole series of Member States, London was a match to the French-German axis (where Berlin is becoming more and more the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of remaining the country in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity right these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have even recently had a demonstration in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly making major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States, consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens in conditions where electoral support for anti-immigrant formations, which are at the same time and euroceptive, grows spectacular across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher rates than ever in the past.
From where and the conclusion of the Financial Times when assessing Brexit chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the Great Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is fuelling the populist rhetoric of the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrated political ambitions, not the ability and availability of Europe's peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the EU's internal tensions will increase in intensity and may further affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brâncus and the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Breeding: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his name is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "trude."
What do you write about Constantin Brâncuşi?
What else is there to say, actually?
The figure showed up on the notes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brâncuşi produces and delivers money to almost 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
Furthermore, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brâncuşi."
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to older people.
Brancuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Even the communists failed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His cities are spreading the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
From the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that, if you didn't have the chance to be born in any big city and in a family as long as it is, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuşi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where the following text should start.
With a sentence, as hateful as they are.
Look at the successful cretin stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at this man's figure.
You want to know how to make it alive, how, today, did he hear a whole mapmond?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Pesşani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
It is the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae Brâncus.
Although he was from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncuși led a modest life, but one of them was to pick up the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up in, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Peter Túțea, from Paris, in 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious".
From the millennia, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything was quiet from one season to another.
And you know why things changed?
Civilization of the city has reached us.
Brâncuși's childhood was, however, far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the "cazan" was being played, following those who dislike the liquid to see if the process is going on properly, Brâncus himself takes a moment of general neglect.
He fills his palm tree with tunics and drinks on the ground.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
First people only notice after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then hysteria, believing her son died.
By evening, when Radu's father returns from the life accompanied by the cheerleaders, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul in their mouth.
The party's turning into a jade.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandșa, dophtoire and serve the Brâncuşi.
The Brandşa checks the child's breath, then puts it under the whale's nose, gathered around.
The strong sneeze child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep longer the drunk, of joy, the party with lauters continues with more force.
The next day, the father and son meet in the livada.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine collect the knots and bring them.
The father sat his baby with his head down and, with the knots brought by the boy, beat him to remember.
And while he feels the heat of the blows, the little Brâncuși has the revelation that the world can be looked at from a different perspective and that things around it can appear overturned.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, unless the star itself participates in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father as what had happened to him?.
At the current time, the city is not working
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted against them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and refocus their agenda to the electorate.
What we're seeing now on our political scene is a big breakdown and so.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither highways nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see just how politicians argue about possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's just leave the politics a little bit, gather and talk.
At the present time, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Blăjuț said.
He appreciated that the current political class disenfranchised the Electoral Officer, the consequence of which was to be a very small presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on civic active people, who are usually right.
"It's cracking even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blăjuț said.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidacy at future local elections, denying the rumors about his intention to enroll in the race for the City Hall.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still thinking about continuing as a deputy in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the lobby talks with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blăjuț said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elect.
A colleague from Tatarași said he didn't get his money and he had to ride the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the cash from the cashier's office.
At the end of the term of office I will report on everything we have spent, outside the salaries of the employees at the office and maintenance of it.
It happened to pick up within a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport, accommodation and the other accounts.
"Let's say a parliamentman doesn't reach his money is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuț concluded.
